Despite the fact that around half of the world’s population goes through menopause, misconceptions about this key stage in people’s reproductive lives still abound. This is often due to social and educational barriers to accessing relevant information. What are some key things that everyone should know about menopause?In Conversation, our expert guest helps us answer this question.

Menopause affects everyone with a uterus. Still, while awareness of the symptoms ofmenopauseand the stage that precedes it, called “perimenopause,” is on the rise, misconceptions and disinformation about these key life stages still abound.

A surveyconducted in 2021 that included over 800 postmenopausal participants in the United Kingdom found that over 90% of them had never learned anything about menopause at school.

When asked how they experienced menopause, many replied that it was a “nightmare” — and the lack of preparedness for the symptoms and how to manage them may have contributed to this assessment.

Perimenopause can take a person by surprise and be confusing, as its symptoms may appear like, or exacerbate those of many other health conditions.

And menopause symptoms — such ashot flashesand chronicinsomnia— can affect a person’s quality of life in unexpected and sometimes severe ways. So what is there to know about this stage of life, and how can a person find the best support and tools for their unique individual needs?

In this episode ofIn Conversation, we answer these and other questions with Prof.Kate Clancy, PhD,professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois, a human reproductive ecologist who specializes in uterine health and the health of people who menstruate.

Clancy, who has a special interest in feminist science and feminist science studies, and is the author ofPeriod: The Real Story of Menstruation, helped us pinpoint five key things that everyone should understand about menopause.
