Hypertension, or high blood pressure, often shows no symptoms. Therefore, regular monitoring or screening is important to help prevent damage to the heart, blood vessels, and other organs.

Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, stress management, and a heart-healthy diet, including reduced salt and alcohol intake, are the first steps in managing hypertension.

If lifestyle adjustments are not enough, medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors can help manage blood pressure, though it is important to be aware of potential interactions with over-the-counter drugs.

Read on to learn why a person’s blood pressure can increase and what the symptoms are.

This article also explains how a person can monitor their blood pressure and discusses ways to keep it within a typical range.

Finally, we answer some common questions about the condition.

What is hypertension?

Blood pressureis the force that a person’s blood exerts against the walls of their blood vessels. This pressure depends on the resistance of the blood vessels and how hard the heart has to work.

Certain conditions, medications, and health factors can increase this pressure.

Hypertension is blood pressure that is consistently higher than140 over 90 millimetersof mercury (mm Hg).

The systolic reading of 130 mm Hg refers to the pressure as the heart pumps blood around the body. The diastolic reading of 80 mm Hg refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes and refills with blood.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (AHA) define blood pressure ranges as:

Hypertension is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, includingstroke,heart attack,heart failure, andaneurysm. Managing blood pressure is vital for preserving health and reducing the risk of these dangerous conditions.

Almosthalf of all adultsin the United States havehigh blood pressure, but many may not know they have it.

A person with hypertension may not notice any symptoms. Without detection, hypertension can damage the heart, blood vessels, and other organs, such as the kidneys.

It is vital to check blood pressure regularly.

In rare and severe cases, high blood pressure can cause:

However, most people with hypertension will experience no symptoms at all.

If high blood pressure becomes ahypertensive crisis, a person may experienceheadachesand nosebleeds.

Long-term hypertension can cause complications throughatherosclerosis, where plaque develops on the walls of blood vessels, causing them to narrow.

This narrowing worsens hypertension because the heart must pump harder to circulate the blood.

Hypertension-related atherosclerosis can lead to:

heart failure and heart attacks

aneurysm, or an atypical bulge in the wall of an artery that can burst

hypertensive retinopathies in the eye, which can lead to blindness

Regular blood pressure monitoring can help people avoid these more severe complications.

Measuring blood pressure

Having high blood pressure for a short time can be a normal response to many situations. Acute stress and intense exercise, for example, can briefly elevate blood pressure in an otherwise healthy person.

For this reason, a diagnosis of hypertension requires several readings that show sustained high blood pressure over time.

The cause of hypertension is often not known. In many cases, it is the result of an underlying condition.

High blood pressure that is not due to another condition or disease is known as primary or essential hypertension. If an underlying condition is a cause of increased blood pressure, doctors call this secondary hypertension.

Primary hypertension can result frommultiple factors, including:

excessive alcohol intake

having a sedentary lifestyle

Secondary hypertension has specific causes and is a complication of another health problem.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)is a common cause of high blood pressure, as the kidneys no longer filter out fluid. This excess fluid leads to hypertension. Hypertension can also cause CKD.

Other conditions that can lead to hypertension include:

diabetes, due to it causing kidney problems and nerve damage

pheochromocytoma— a rare cancer of an adrenal gland

congenital adrenal hyperplasia — a disorder of the cortisol-secreting adrenal glands

hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland

hyperparathyroidism, which affectscalciumand phosphorous levels

A number of factors increase the risk of hypertension.

Age:Hypertension is more common in people who are over65 years old. Blood pressure can increase steadily with age as the arteries stiffen and narrow due to plaque buildup.

Ethnicity:Some ethnic groups are more prone to hypertension than others. African Americans have ahigher riskthan other ethnic groups, for example.

Weight:Obesity is a primary risk factor for hypertension.

Alcohol and tobacco use:Regularly consuming large quantities of alcohol or tobacco can increase blood pressure.

Sex:According to a2018 review, males have a higher risk of developing hypertension than females. However, this is only until females reachmenopause.

Existing health conditions:Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, andhigh cholesterollevels can lead to hypertension, especially as people age.

Management and treatment

Lifestyle adjustments are the standard, first-line treatment for hypertension.

Regular physical exercise

Current guidelines recommend that all people, including those with hypertension, engage in at least150 minutesof moderate-intensity aerobic exercise every week or 75 minutes per week of high-intensity exercise.

People should exercise at least 5 days every week.

Examples of suitable activities are:

Studies show that strength, or resistance, training can alsoreduce blood pressurein hypertensive people.

Avoiding or learning to managestresscan help a person control blood pressure.

A few relaxation techniques that can help relieve stress are:

People should avoid consumingalcoholand recreational drugs to cope with stress, as these can contribute to elevated blood pressure and the complications of hypertension.

Smoking can also increase blood pressure. Avoiding orquitting smokingreduces the risk of hypertension, serious heart conditions, and other health issues.

People can use specific medications to treat hypertension. Doctors will often recommend a low dose at first. Antihypertensive medications will usually only have minor side effects.

Eventually, people with hypertension may need to combinetwo or moredrugs to manage their blood pressure.

Medications for hypertension include:

diuretics, including thiazides, chlorthalidone, and indapamide

beta-blockersand alpha-blockers

calcium-channel blockers

peripheral adrenergic inhibitors

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors

angiotensin receptor blockers

The choice of medication depends on the person and any underlying medical conditions they may have.

Anyone taking antihypertensive medications should carefully read the labels of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs they may also take, such as decongestants. These OTC drugs can interact with the medications they are taking to lower their blood pressure.

People can prevent high blood pressure by following a heart-healthy diet.

High sodium consumptioncontributesto high blood pressure. The main source of sodium in the diet is salt.

The AHA recommends that people without hypertension consume less than2,300 milligrams (mg)of sodium per day. This roughly equates to one teaspoon. People with hypertension should consume less than 1,500 mg of sodium per day to manage their condition.

Moderating alcohol consumption

Moderate to excessive alcohol consumption can increase blood pressure.

The AHA recommends a maximum oftwo alcoholic drinks per dayfor males and one for females.

The following would count as one drink:

a 12-ounce (oz) bottle of beer

1.5 oz of 80-proof spirits

1 oz of 100-proof spirits

A healthcare professional can help people reduce consumption if they find it difficult to moderate their alcohol intake.

Eating more fruits and vegetables and less fat

People who have high blood pressure or people at high risk of developing it should reduce their intake of saturated fats in favor of unsaturated fats.

Learn more about saturated and unsaturated fats here.

Expertsrecommendthat people with high blood pressure prioritize more heart-healthy foods, such as:

whole grain, high-fiber foods

a variety of fruits and vegetables

pulses, such as chickpeas, beans, and lentils

fish rich in omega-3 twice per week

nontropical vegetable oils, such as olive oil

skinless poultry and fish

low-fat dairy products

Limiting trans fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, animal fats, and processed fast foods can help manage blood pressure.

However, some fats can be a healthful addition to diet plans. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as oily fish and olive oil, have protective effects on the heart. While these are typically healthful, people with a risk of hypertension should still include them in their total fat intake.

Excessbody weightcancontributeto hypertension. A fall in blood pressure usually follows weight loss because the heart does not have to work so hard to pump blood around the body.

A balanced diet with a calorie intake that matches the person’s size, sex, and activity level will help.

The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)recommends the DASH dietfor people with high blood pressure. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.

DASH is a flexible and balanced eating plan with a firm grounding in research by the NHLBI, which says that the diet:

lowers high blood pressure

improves levels of fats in the bloodstream

reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease

How can I lower my blood pressure quickly?

Physical relaxation and calming breathing exercises can help lower blood pressure during extreme stress. Taking relevant medication and practicing healthy lifestyle habits are often the fastest way to lower blood pressure in the short to medium term.

A person has hypertension when their blood pressure is consistently high.

However, the American College of Cardiology and the AHA recommend that people with hypertension maintain their blood pressure below130/80 mm Hg.

Hypertension can increase a person’s risk of developing a range of heart-related conditions, such as heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke.

Family history and lifestyle factors are often the cause of hypertension, while dietary and activity changes can help people maintain a healthy blood pressure level.

Doctors may also recommend a combination of medications to manage a person’s blood pressure.
