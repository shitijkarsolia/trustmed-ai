The tetanus vaccine protects people who may come into contact with the bacteria that cause tetanus. As with any vaccine, the tetanus shot can lead to the possibility of some side effects.

Tetanus is a rare but potentially dangerous disease that causes stiffening and tightening of the muscles. Tetanus occurs due to the bacteria called Clostridium tetani, which is present in the environment such as manure, dust, and soil.

A person can contract tetanus when the bacteria enters the body through broken skin.

Vaccines are a type of medication and, just as with other medicines, there is always the possibility of side effects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that most side effects are not serious and will resolve in1 to 3 days.

The side effects a person might experience can vary depending on the type of vaccine. These vaccines may beas follows:

DTaP:The DTaP vaccine is the form doctors often use for very young children. It prevents tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.

Tdap:The Tdap vaccine prevents tetanus, while also working to prevent diphtheria and pertussis, or whooping cough.

Td or DT:The Td and DT shots prevent tetanus and diphtheria.

Mild side effects include:

Serious side effects are not common but may still occur in certain people.

More severe side effects

More serious side effectsinclude:

seizures, which affects about 1 in 14,000 children

crying that lasts for 3 or more hours, which affects about 1 in 1,000 children

high feverover 105°F, which affects about 1 in 16,000 children

After receiving a vaccination, people may experiencedizziness. If a person experience dizziness, vision changes, orringing in the ears, they should tell a healthcare professional.

In rare cases, the DTaP vaccine can cause the entire arm or leg to swell. Babies and young children will require up to five DTaP shots, and the swelling is more likely to happen after the child receives thefourth or fifth shot.

Severe allergic reaction

There is also a rare possibility of a person having a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine.

The reaction would start to happen between afew minutes to 1 hourafter receiving the injection, and it requires immediate medical attention.

Anaphylaxis: Symptoms and what to do

Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life threatening. The symptoms develop suddenly and include:

swelling of the face or mouth

fast, shallow breathing

fainting or loss of consciousness

If someone has these symptoms:

Check whether they are carrying an epinephrine pen. If they are, follow the instructions on the side of the pen to use it.

Dial 911 or the number of the nearest emergency department.

Assist the person in moving from a sitting position to lying down. If they have vomited, turn them onto their side.

Stay with them until the emergency services arrive.

Some people may need more than one epinephrine injection. If the symptoms do not improve in 5 to 15 minutes, or they come back, use a second pen if the person has one.

Do tetantus booster vaccines cause side effects?

Healthcare professionals use the Tdap and Td vaccine as boosters.

It is possible to experience side effects after receiving a tetanus booster shot. If a person experiences side effects after receiving a booster shot, they will likely be the same as the side effects listed above.

Does the tetanus vaccine cause autism?

The tetanus vaccine does not cause autism.

While people express concerns about the potential for serious side effects from vaccines, this worry may come partly frommisinformation. As theUnited States Department of Health and Human Servicesstates, research shows vaccines do not lead to autism.

Medical researchers monitor vaccines constantly, and any evidence linking vaccinations to severe disabilities or other health problems would prompt medical authorities to take swift safety measures.

When to contact a doctor

Most side effects are mild and will resolve without treatment. A person can discuss potential side effects with a healthcare professional before getting the vaccine. A healthcare professional can also provide information on how best to manage these side effects.

A person should contact a doctor if they are concerned about any side effects they might be experiencing.

If a person develops severe side effects, such as an severe allergic reaction, they should contact the emergency services immediately.

Who should avoid tetanus shots?

People should avoid getting the tetanus vaccine if they:

have a serious allergy to any of the ingredients used in the vaccine

have previously had a serious reaction to the diphtheria, tetanus, or whooping cough vaccines

People with certain conditions may also want to be wary when looking to get a tetanus shot and should talk with their doctor to discuss their options. People should inform the doctor if they have ever had:

severe pain or swelling from a tetanus vaccine

nervous system conditions

Guillain Barre syndrome, where the immune system attacks nerve cells

Some tetanus vaccines may pose a risk to the health of people with any of these concerns. Doctors can advise them on how they should take care to avoid the diseases a vaccine would protect against.

People should always discuss any health concerns or conditions they have with a doctor before having any vaccine.

The side effects of a tetanus shot are uncommon and mild, and they usually go away on their own in a few days. Most people think the chances of having side effects are much smaller than the risks of conditions such as tetanus.

Rarely, people may have a severe reaction to the vaccines and should avoid them, but these reactions are not common. The tetanus shot is a safe and effective way to prevent tetanus and other dangerous diseases from occurring in most cases.

Anyone concerned about the vaccine or the possible side effects should talk with a doctor.
