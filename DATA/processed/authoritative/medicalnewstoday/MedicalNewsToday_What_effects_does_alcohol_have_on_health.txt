Alcohol is the intoxicating ingredient that is present in wine, beer, and spirits. It is a depressant, which means that when it reaches the brain, it slows down the body’s systems. The short-term effects of alcohol depend on multiple factors.

It can also be difficult for the body to process, putting extra pressure on the liver, the digestive system, the cardiovascular system, and other functions.

Alcohol is a legal recreational substance for adults and one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States. People consume alcohol to socialize, to relax, and to celebrate.

It can be misused among individuals of all ages, which may result in significant health, legal, and socio-economic damage.

Fast facts about alcohol

Pure alcohol is a colorless, odorless, and flammable liquid.

Fruits and grains are the foods most commonly used foods to make alcohol.

Alcohol is the number one abused drug by minors in the U.S.

The liver can only oxidize about one drink per hour.

Alcohol is known to be harmful to developing brains, from before birth to adolescence.

No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy.

Combined with other medications, whether over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed, alcohol’s effects can be deadly.

Within minutes of consuming alcohol, it is absorbed into the bloodstream by blood vessels in the stomach lining and small intestine.

It then travels to the brain, where it quickly produces its effects.

The short-term effects of alcohol depend on:

the weight, sex, and body fat percentage of the individual

whether or not they have eaten

Drinking with a mealslows the rateof absorption, resulting in fewer side effects and less intoxication.

Signs of intoxication

At first, the person may feel relaxed, uninhibited, or giddy. As they consume more alcohol, intoxication may result.

Other signs of intoxication include:

clumsiness and unsteady gait

distortion of senses and perception

loss of consciousness

One drinkis the equivalent of:

12 ounces of beer that is around 5 percent alcohol, depending on the type

5 ounces of wine that is around 12 percent alcohol

1.5-ounces of spirits, or a “shot,” at about 40 percent alcohol

8 ounces of malt liquor, at around 7 percent alcohol

In other words, these servings all contain the same amount of alcohol: 0.6 ounces.

Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream. It is expressed as the weight of ethanol in grams per 100 milliliter (ml) of blood.

The body absorbs alcohol relatively quickly, but it takes longer to get the alcohol out of the body. The liver needs about 1 hour to process one drink. Consuming several drinks in a short time causes the alcohol builds up in the body. This puts the body’s systems under pressure. It can lead to illness and, in severe cases, death.

It also increases the risk of blackouts, especially on an empty stomach. During this time, a person may do things that they do not remember later.

Binge drinking isdefinedas drinking within 2 hours:

Five or more drinks for a man

Four or more drinks for a woman

This is because women and men metabolize alcohol differently.

Intoxication impairs judgment and can result in inappropriate and illegal behaviors such as sexual promiscuity, disorderly conduct, driving while intoxicated and acts of violence.

When the amount of alcohol in the blood exceeds a certain level, this can lead to alcohol toxicity, or poisoning. This is a dangerous condition.

Since alcohol is a depressant, it can slow breathing, leading to a lack of oxygen to the brain.

Signs and symptomsinclude:

blue tint to the skin

loss of consciousness

Some people will feel unwell immediately after drinking alcohol. They may have an intolerance, insensitivity, or allergy to alcohol or another ingredient in a drink.

Combining alcohol with other depressant-type medications—whether over-the-counter preparations, prescription, or recreational drugs—can have serious effects on the respiratory and central nervous systems.

It is especiallydangerous to mixalcohol with GHB, rohypnol, ketamine, tranquilizers, and sleeping pills.

After drinking too much in an evening, a person may continue to feel the effects of the alcohol on waking up, with what is commonly called a “hangover.”

This is because alcohol is toxic to the body, and the body is still working to get rid of the toxin.

Many of the symptoms are the result ofdehydration, but some chemicals in alcoholic drinks can cause a reaction in the blood vessels and the brain that make symptoms worse.

difficulty concentrating

Around20%of alcohol is absorbed through the stomach. Most of the remaining 80 percent is absorbed through the small intestine. Around 5 percent of the alcohol consumed leaves through the lungs, kidneys and the skin. The liver removes the rest.

Since the liver can only process the equivalent of one drink at a time, the body may remain saturated with the alcohol that has not yet left the body.

It can take from 2 to 3 hours for the body to metabolize alcohol from one to two drinks, and up to 24 hours to process the alcohol from eight to ten drinks.

A hangover can last up to 24 hours or longer.

Alcohol contributes to over 200 diseases and injury-related health conditions including dependence andaddiction, livercirrhosis,cancers, and unintentional injuries such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, burns, assaults, and drowning.

Long-term alcohol misuse is associated with the following health problems:

cardiomyopathy, or damage to the heart muscle

other cardiovascular problems

immune system dysfunction

brain and nerve damage

mental healthproblems such asanxietyanddepression

Alcohol affects every body system, so it can cause health problems throughout the body.

Research shows that women who drink more alcohol than is recommended on a regular basis tend to develop liver disease, cardiomyopathy and nerve damage after fewer years than men who do the same.

Alcohol can have a serious effect on thedeveloping brain, from fetal development to the end of adolescence. If a woman consumes alcohol during pregnancy, the child may be born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).

Addiction and withdrawal

If a person consumes large amounts of alcohol regularly, their tolerance can increase, and the body requires more alcohol to achieve the desired effect.

As the body adapts to the presence of the drug, dependency and addiction can result. If consumption stops suddenly, the person may experience withdrawal symptoms.

Alcohol addiction is a disease characterized by a strong craving for alcohol, and continued use despite a negative impact on health, interpersonal relationships, and ability to work. If the person stops drinking, they will experience withdrawal symptoms.

Signs and symptoms of withdrawal generally peak at around72 hoursafter last intake. They may last up to 5 days.

Many people will take a drink to stop the discomfort of withdrawal.

In more severe cases, the person may experience Delirium tremens, or “the DTs.”

This condition involves:

changes in mental status

seizures that can result in death

elevated blood pressure

Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Anyone with an alcohol dependency disorder who desires to stop drinking should seek professional medical care or a treatment center specializing in safe alcohol detoxification.

Treatment for alcohol use disorder

The treatment of alcohol dependency involves a variety of interventions, and it requires medical, social, and family support.

individual and group counseling

medication, such as disulfiram (Antabuse), naltrexone and acamprosate (Campral)

participation in support networks such as Alcoholics Anonymous

A detoxification program in a hospital or medical facility is another option for those who need a higher level of care.
