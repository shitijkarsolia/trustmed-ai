The normal pH level of the vagina is around 4.5. Infections, douching, and the presence of menstrual blood are some of the factors that can change the balance.

Maintaining the pH balance of the vagina is essential to keeping it healthy. Doctors can take a vaginal pH measurement to determine how acidic the vaginal environment is. It’s also possible to test this at home.

In the vagina, a high pH may cause infections as it can allow bacteria and yeast to thrive.

In this article, learn more about normal vaginal pH levels, how to test them at home, and what to do to restore vaginal pH balance.

Typical vaginal pH level

A normal vaginal pH isaround 4.5, but this can vary. A2021 reviewnoted that a healthy vaginal pH can range between 3.8 and 5.

This range is moderately acidic. A pH level within this range can help protect against bacterial and fungal infections.

What is considered a normal vaginal pH level also varies by age. A person of reproductive age would have a normal vaginal pH between 4.0 to 4.5, while women who have yet to begin menstruating or who have gone through menopause may have a normal vaginal pH higher than 4.5

Lactobacilli bacteria live in the vagina and secrete lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which give the vagina its acidic pH level.

Vaginal pH is usually less than 4.5 during a woman’s reproductive years unless a condition or infection raises it.

What causes unbalanced vaginal pH?

Several conditions and infections can affect the vaginal pH balance, usually by increasing pH levels. Causes of changes in vaginal pH include the following:

Bacterial vaginosisis a medical condition that occurs when too much bacteria is present in the vagina. Thiscan causean increase in vaginal pH levels.

A person with bacterial vaginosis may experience itching, burning, or pain in the vagina. They may also feel burning when urinating, notice unusual odors, and experience white or gray discharge.

Learn abouttreating bacterial vaginosis at home.

Other vaginal infections

The presence of infections other than bacterial vaginosis may also increase the vaginal pH. Examples include Trichomonas vaginalis and group B Streptococcus.

Douchingrefers to washing or cleaning the vagina using particular solutions, such as those containing vinegar or baking soda.

Proponents of the activity often claim it reduces vaginal odor, but this will only be temporary. Exposing the vagina to these solutionsalso increasesthe risk of infection.

This is because they wash out good bacteria, which affects the vaginal pH balance and can make someone more prone to infections.

Vaginal pH levels canbe an indicationof menopausal status. Those who have gone through menopause may have a slightly higher vaginal pH than people of reproductive age.

Reducedestrogenlevels during menopause may affect a person’s vaginal pH.

Presence of menstrual blood

Blood has a higher pH than the vaginal environment. When a person is menstruating, the presence of menstrual blood can increase vaginal pH levels.

Semen is basic, which is the opposite of the vagina’s acidic environment. When semen enters the vagina, it may temporarily increase the pH.

People useantibioticsto kill harmful bacteria, but these medications can kill good bacteria as well. This will include bacteria in the vagina. If a person is taking antibiotics, their vaginal pH may be out of balance.

An atypical vaginal Ph can increase a person’s risk of complications, including:

Urinary tract infections (UTIs):A high vaginal pH canincreasea person’s risk of developing aUTI.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs):Elevated vaginal pH also increases the risk ofSTIs.

Preterm birth:Some studieshave found associations between elevated vaginal pH levels — particularly bacterial vaginosis — and risk of preterm births.

How to maintain vaginal pH balance

Practicing good vaginal hygiene can help maintain a healthy pH balance. Good practices include:

Avoiding harsh soaps and douching:Soaps typically have a high pH, and using them to clean the vaginal area may increase vaginal pH.

Changing tampons regularly:A person should change tampons every4 to 8 hours. This also helps reduce the risk of bacterial infections, including toxic shock syndrome.

Using barrier protection during sex:Using barrier protection, such as condoms or dental dams, not only helps prevent pregnancy and STIs but can prevent semen and other fluids from affecting pH levels in the vagina.

Avoiding scented feminine hygiene products:Sprays, bubble baths, and scented pads or tampons canincrease the riskof yeast infections which can affect the pH of the vagina.

Can you balance vaginal ph naturally?

If a person’s vaginal pH levels are routinely high without any symptoms of an infection, they can take several steps at home to reduce their pH levels. These include:

takegarlicsupplements

drinkdiluted apple cider vinegar

quit smokingif applicable

Doctors can also prescribe creams, such as estrogen cream, which may help reduce the vagina’s pH levels.

Keeping vaginal pH levels in balance can help reduce infections and prevent complications.

Doctors rarely rely just on measurements of vaginal pH to diagnose medical conditions, such as yeast infections, or to determine whether or not someone is approaching menopause.

However, vaginal pH tests can help confirm a suspected diagnosis.

People can take steps, such as using probiotic supplements and not douching, to help keep their vaginal pH levels balanced.
