===============================================================================

I’m taking a poll - and if you’re a doctor, please tell me what you’ve been seeing a lot of when you examine patients whose heart palpitations started after getting Covid. I am currently in the diagnostic process and want to know what the various common causes of this trend might be. I don’t believe I have POTS but I’m going to get that checked - I know there are many other possible diagnoses.

I was technically diagnosed with POTS after covid though I almost definitely had it all my life, it was just heredity and my mother made it seem like it was something that was normal. Covid just made it so I couldn’t cope.
