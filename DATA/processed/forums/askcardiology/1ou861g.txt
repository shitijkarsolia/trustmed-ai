Everyone responds differently to treatments/therapy etc but on low end 5 year survival of 50%, on the high end 60-70% (assuming ideal responses to treatment). 10 year low end 20-25% , high end 35-40%. Still that is just estimated on the heart issues as no one here knows your history, co-morbidities etc. Your doctors will develop a plan. You stick to their instructions and do exactly what they say. My father had terrible heart, several heart attacks, 20-30% damage, stents, Agioplasty, inplanted pacemaker, defib, He started in his 50s and lived to be 79. You can definitely beat those odds. Good luck
