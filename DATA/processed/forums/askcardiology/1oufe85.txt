===============================================================================

My dad has Atrial fibrillation and was recently admitted to hospital for breathlessness, the doctor put him a Digoxin 187.5 micrograms and today the doctor called to give him two options either they put him on a pacemaker and stop Digoxin completely or he takes Digoxin for life.. my dads heart rate is too high and the Digoxin was given to lower the heart rate. When I Google the uses of a pacemaker it says its for increasing a low heart rate but as my dads heart rate is high close to 95 is a pacemaker the best option? Thank you

In your dad’s case, the doctor might suggest one if they plan to use stronger rate-controlling or rhythm-correcting treatments that could make his heart too slow without a pacemaker’s support. The pacemaker acts as a safety net, allowing the use of more effective medications without the risk of a dangerously slow heartbeat.
