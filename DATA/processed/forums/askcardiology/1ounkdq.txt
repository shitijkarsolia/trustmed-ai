===============================================================================

M29 5.9 240lbs, I've been having chest pains on left and right side of my chest over last 6 weeks, I've been to er they said im fine I've had 4 ekgs done and all came back normal, I've had xray on my lungs done and it's normal. What could this be? I have to wait until next week to get a heart monitor and then have to wait another week for a stress test. Just looking for some kind of insight of what could be causing this.

Your scheduled tests are for final confirmation, but the most common causes are musculoskeletal issues, such as a strained chest wall muscle or costochondritis GERD or anxiety are also very common culprits for this type of pain.
