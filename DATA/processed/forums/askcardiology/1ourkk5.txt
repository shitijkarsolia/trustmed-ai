===============================================================================

They told me lots of things and there is some info in the paperwork I went home with, but I'm unclear how long i should leave this on? After it comes off should I keep a regular bandaid on it? The spot of blood was there when they were applying the dressing so not worried about that one.

Okay to shower but don’t submerge it, (hot tubs, bath etc), and don’t keep a bandaid on it so that it will dry. Don’t mess with the scab. I wrapped a hand towel around it and loosely taped it when sleeping so I wouldn’t bang it on something in my sleep.

4. u/Lecture_Good [score=2, created=2025-11-11T21:11:18]: 24-48hrs
5. u/Nickilaughs [score=2, created=2025-11-11T21:18:33]: I was told about a day then keep it clean and dry after taking off dressing
6. u/rosysredrhinoceros [score=4, created=2025-11-11T18:25:32]: That’s kind of a strange dressing, was that just a regular IV? The two gauzes folded next to each other with a tegaderm over them isn’t standard anywhere I’ve worked. Maybe for an arterial line, but that’s not quite where I’d expect it to be on the wrist. (Am nurse, though not a cardiology nurse, but I don’t see anything in the sub rules about who can comment, so hopefully this is ok as it’s not a cardio-specific answer)

8. u/Ok-Sock9046 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T21:30:16]: i had one a few weeks ago they said 24 hours then just keep a band aid on it
