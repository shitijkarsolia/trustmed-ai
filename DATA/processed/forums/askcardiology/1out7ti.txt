===============================================================================

I had a cardiologist appointment today. Listing all of my symptoms the doctor originally thought it might be POTS. But then he tested my blood pressure and heart rate while lying/sitting/standing and it didn’t go as he expected. I don’t remember the exact numbers for my heart rate but attached is the blood pressure results. He’s thinking it might be orthostatic hypotension but my heart rate was also more than 30 bpm difference going from lying to standing. He said it all might be due to dehydration originally but then I told him that I drink approximately 120 ounces of water a day, and all my lab work looked relatively normal so that wouldn’t really explain it. If I’m not laying down or sitting back my heart rate spikes anywhere between 130-180 with light activity. Eating and drinking makes my heart rate go up at least 25bpm and I can feel my heart racing. It started out as random irregularities but now it’s to the point that it’s all over the place unless I’m lying or sitting down. I am going to get a heart monitor for two weeks and eventually an echocardiogram and a stress test but those won’t be until the beginning of the year unless there’s cancellations. Anyone have any ideas on what could be going on? The blood pressure and heart rate at the top of the picture are from when I first sat down at the appointment.
