===============================================================================

My 70-year-old dad just died of a sudden cardiac arrest. Such a shock for our family - he was so active, athletic, and energetic. Wish physicals for those over 60 included a visit/referral to a cardiologist. My dad never had a heart attack (that we know of) prior to this. My paternal grandfather died of a sudden cardiac arrest at 47. My maternal grandmother had atrial fibrillation and died in her sleep from AFib at 81. Even though my siblings and I (all in our 30s) are active, fit, and have healthy BMIs, we worry that we may die prematurely due to some heart-related issue too. What are the chances that we will develop heart disease? What can we do to prevent heart disease and SCA?
