===============================================================================

went in to the ER for chest pain on my left side had a full work up done everything came back normal except my ekg this time stated this: ABNORMAL ECG - Sinus rhythm normal P axis, V-rate 60-99 Probable left atrial enlargement P &gt;50mS, &lt;-0.10mV V1 Borderline left axis deviation QRS axis (-15,-29) Low voltage, precordial leads precordial leads &lt;1.0mV Borderline T abnormalities, inferior leads T flat/neg, Il Ill aVF usually mine look something like this but probable left atrial enlargement is new. i had a full cardiac workup done last year including echo and everything was normal but ive had a child since then. should i be concerned? doc didnt seem to concerned but im wondering if i should rush to see a cardiologist or wait to see primary in january
