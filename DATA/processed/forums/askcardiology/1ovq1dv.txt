===============================================================================

F/32/470lbs: I went the doctor today a BP of 184/118, a resting HR of 90-100 (jumping to 150+ when walking), extreme shortness of breath, a headache that isn’t getting better with Tylenol, general fatigue, body heaviness/soreness, sudden heartburn, and a strange sense of something just not feeling “right”. The doctor didn’t do an ecg, and instead told me that she had to advise me to go to the ER. They did note my temp was 99.6. Long story short, I really didn’t want to do that and came home instead. I still don’t feel “normal”, but my resting HR is showing 90-100 on my watch and I took this Apple Watch ECG. I’m assuming with these measures that I just have an illness coming on. It all looks fine, right? It looks fine to me. Just want a peace of mind before going to sleep, because if I need to call out I need to do it early. 😩 Thanks and sorry for the waste of time! (Note: I am actively under care of a nutritionist pursuing weight loss options)

Your blood pressure is too high. A lot. Nobody will just go "oh yeah 188/108 is fine". Fine would be 120/80 or for "slightly wrong because measured wrong maybe 140/90. I quote: "A hypertensive crisis is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room (ER) for treatment." https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24470-hypertensive-crisis

I understand how inconvenient this process may seem (waiting in an er for meds to work, calling off work, etc..) but please appreciate some of the terminology here. The reading calls these resting numbers a "crisis." The doc said "*have* to say go to the er.." these numbers are seriously high and dangerous. If i were supervising a stress test and the diastolic (bottom number) was staying at 118, I would stop that test for the safety of the patient. So they all thought this was a serious concern. You said you have an appt in a week so I hope things are OK but seeing these numbers repeatedly and having symptoms on top of it I feel is playing with fire. Good luck.

As someone with an average BP listed in my flair you're at high risk of heart attack and stroke if you continue with those levels. It's only a matter of time before your blood vessels end up exploding. Yes you need to call off work. That blood pressure will destroy you at some point. Yes, my goal is to scare you with the consequences of what happens if you refuse to get that treated.

6. u/nothingtoogreat [score=1, created=2025-11-13T17:45:02]: No one cares about the EKG. The blood pressure is causing all of your symptoms. If it’s still that high, please go to the ED. You’re in hypertensive crisis. Not taking care of this could cause a stroke! Not to mention chronic high blood pressure changes your heart and its function and leaves you susceptible to aneurysms or dissections.
