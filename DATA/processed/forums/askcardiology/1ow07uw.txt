===============================================================================

This is quite a long post. I'm just trying to figure out what went wrong with my heart, when I have clear arteries, I'm, young, fit and live mostly healthy. I've tried to document everything I can think of, I do have a cardiologist appointment coming up, and knowing what to ask would be very helpful. I'm really hoping to get to figure out what the cause was so I can prevent it from happening again. I've included all my ECGs and my MRI at the bottom. Thanks to all: **Age**: 46 **Gender**: Male **Height**: 1.74m **Weight**: 69kg **BMI**: 22.8 **BSA**: 1.83 **Family heart history**: My father had a heart valve replaced when he was 70. He was hugely overweight (120kg increasing to 165kg before the heart valve replacement at 1.8m tall) and diabetic after years of eating and drinking alcohol excessively though. No other relatives that I know of have heart issues. **Other health symptoms**: For the past 3 years I’ve had episodes of extreme vertigo maybe every 2 months. They seem to be triggered by head positions and often on days I feel dehydrated. They resolve quickly, especially when I lie down. I haven’t been able to trigger them myself, and after speaking to a GP they said I should go as soon as I’ve had one to an ENT, but unfortunately I’ve never had one when there was an ENT available. I’ll see an ENT this winter to see if they can figure this out. Starting around the same timeframe I’ve also had episodes of double vision, again I feel that there’s a dehydration trigger in this, but also that the bright light I’m in all the time could cause some eye strain. These occur also very infrequently and resolve on their own after a minute or so. I do see an ophthalmologist annually, but I’ve forgotten to bring it up in my last 2 visits. I have an appointment again in March where I will bring it up. **About me:** I’m very active, in winter I typically go to gym around 4-5 times a week focusing on weights and body weight exercises. Cardio is generally walking (10,000 steps normally, up to 20,000) and cycling at low intensity. In summer we live on a sailboat, so my exercise is walking, rowing to shore and back, swimming, stand up paddleboarding and bodyweight exercises at outdoor gyms once or twice a week. I’ve got an athletic build and have maintained low levels of bodyfat (&lt;10%) for the last 15 years. Before this episode I never took any medication, only a multi-vitamin. This image is from a few days ago, indicating that I'm lean and in shape, weird chest hair thanks to the nurses :) https://preview.redd.it/311vf08fp01g1.jpg?width=1539&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebcd82fc864a7d06b3393b31cfb6881d99b8f766 I have never been a drinker or a smoker, and eat healthily most days, with no sugar or starch in my diet at least 6 days a week, with intermittent fasting on around an 18:6 eating window, typically eating my main meal between 6pm and 9pm in summer, earlier in winter. On off days I would indulge in take out food and sugar, which wouldn’t agree with my system. If I overindulged it would cause me to have a noticeable heartbeat, and a very bloated stomach for the next day or so. Until June this year I’ve never been a coffee drinker, but I started having coffee with my wife in the mornings. My blood pressure is usually around the 120/85 level but I have had times when it was higher. The last time it was higher was in February/March 2019 where it peaked around the 140/90 level for around a week if I remember right. It was a particularly busy time at work, and I hadn’t been exercising as much as usual. I resolved it by upping my cardio at the gym, and cutting weight from 73kg to 70kg, and since then it’s been back around the 120/85 range. The other times it was high were isolated tests. I’ve also been told I have white coat hypertension, where sudden stress could raise the numbers. The last time this happened was around 2021 when I needed to pass a blood pressure test for my drone pilots licence, where my pressure at home was normal, but at the doctors office was 140/90. I did buy a blood pressure monitor around then, and confirmed it was working correctly and the blood pressure lowered again when I was at home. **Timeline around the heart episode** **13/14 October**: I had a stomach bug with diarrhea. It was short-lived but intense. I was walking to a bathroom onshore and got so light headed that I had to sit on the ground where I was for a few minutes, very unusual for me. After going to the bathroom I felt better, and carried on with my day, but taking it easy. After that day I was back to normal. **24 October**: We went out for pizza and pasta. The chef/owner of the restaurant was ill, and told us that. The seafood pasta also tasted odd, my wife actually stopped eating it after one bite, but she’s quite a fussy eater, and I thought it was reasonable so carried on. We also had an ice cream, and later I had two slabs of chocolate and some popcorn. **25 October +- 3am**: I woke up choking with some vomit in my mouth. I never vomited, but my body was in full panic from the choke, I remember my heart beating very strongly, and it took me a while to calm down again and get back to sleep. **26 October**: Seemed like a normal day, we went to shore for coffee, walked the dogs, did some shopping and then in the early afternoon went to move the boat. On the way to the boat I had a double vision episode, which resolved after a minute or two. I felt fine, but on lifting the anchor (20kg) I felt some mild heartburn. When I got back inside the boat I also noticed that I felt hot, which was unusual for me. My wife said “what if it’s a heart attack” which caused me to panic a little, so I went to get my blood pressure monitor. The first reading was very high, but I kept taking readings every so often and it dropped quickly back to normal, here’s an approximate timeline for the readings: || || |**Time**|**Systolic**|**Diastolic**|**Pulse Pressure**|**Pulse**|**Notes**| |14:00|150|107|43|72|My wife said maybe it was a heart attack which freaked me out and I'm sure raised my blood pressure| |14:03|145|107|38|74|Time is estimated| |14:06|139|102|37|76|Time is estimated| |14:15|133|96|37|72|Time is estimated| |14:45|116|80|36|70|Time is estimated| |15:45|118|88|30|67|Time is estimated| |16:00|123|93|30|74|Time is estimated, after docking the boat| |16:15|116|86|30|63|Time is estimated, after speaking to the neighbour| |16:30|119|89|30|68|Just before leaving for the hospital| I felt fine after docking the boat and pulling the lines tight with normal strength etc. I had a conversation with the neighbour and carried on as normal, but at around 17:00 we decided to walk to Preveza hospital (+-2km) and see how I felt when I got there. I actually felt fine, the heartburn had passed earlier, but decided to get checked out anyway since I was already there. They did an ECG which they said was normal and then took some blood (all ECG printouts are right at the bottom). I waited outside for two hours and they came to call me inside for an ECHO and another blood test. After another half an hour they game me a pill to chew, said I’d had a heart attack and was moving to the bigger regional hospital for an angiogram. It was a 2 hour drive to Ioannina hospital with another heart attack patient. He had his angiogram first and needed stents so it took quite some time before I could have mine. It was eventually my turn, I had some more medication and went in, and then after a short while I was wheeled out again. The doctors said my arteries were all very clear and so my issue must be something else. I was sent into the ER at around 1am, still feeling fine apart from the sore arm, and hooked up to an ECG and blood oxygen meter. The ECG was normal, and my blood oxygen sat pretty much at 100% all the time, so they removed that after a day or so. In the ER on the first morning (27 October) they tested my Troponin again and it was on 9000ng/L. The next morning (28 October) they tested it and it was 13102ng/L so I had to spend another day in ER. They did a range of other tests in the ER and all came back normal: Creat = 1.03mg/dl Hb = 13.1gr/dl, PLTs=280,00 Trop I max = 13102ng/L, LDL-71mg/dl, CRP 0.21mg/dl. I was also told I had an ejection fraction of 55%. On 29 October they tested my Troponin again and it had dropped to 4000ng/L and I was sent to the regular ward. I had a 24 hour Holter monitor there which was normal. On 31 October I was tested again for Troponin and it was on 900ng/L and I was discharged and told to arrange a CMR. **I went for the MRI on 5 November, these are the notes from the MRI:** Admission 26/10/2025-31/10/2025 with chest pain and Trop rise. ICA: no significant coronary artery stenosis. **FINDINGS** Left ventricle: Normal indexed volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. Normal wall thickness (max 9mm at the basal septum) and mass index. Right ventricle: Normal volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No regional wall motion abnormality. No right ventricular hypertrophy Atria: Both atria are of normal size (LA 29ml/m2 and RA 39ml/m2). No significant cardiac shunt identified. Qp/Qs\~1.05 Valves: Tricuspid aortic valve. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary valve. Great Vessels: Thoracic aorta (ascending aorta 27mm at the RPA level) and pulmonary artery (main PA 21mm) are of normal calibre. Normal aortic arch branching. No aortic coarctation. STIR-T2 images: Increased myocardial signal at the basal LV inferolateral wall. Pericardium: Small pericardial effusion (\~2mm adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall). Increased pericardial signal adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall on STIR and LGE imaging. Tissue characterisation: Native myocardial T1 values and T2 values at the basal LV inferolateral wall are increased (\~1165ms and \~69ms at 1.5T respectively). Normal ECV value of the whole myocardium (\~25%) with increased value of the basal LV inferolateral wall \~47%. Gadolinium study: In the early phase, no LV/RV thrombus is evident. In the late phase, there is almost transmural LGE of the basal LV inferolateral wall. Extra-cardiac findings: Unremarkable. Please note; formal assessment of extracardiac pathology was not undertaken on this scan. Correlation with other imaging modalities is advised. **CONCLUSIONS** 1. Normal LV volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. No LVH. 2. Normal RV volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No RWMAs. No RVH. 3. Myocardial oedema of the basal LV inferolateral wall. 4. LGE at the basal LV inferolateral wall. 5. Small pericardial effusion with increased localised pericardial signal adjacent to the basal inferolateral LV wall on STIR and LGE images, indicating mild localised pericardial inflammation. Findings are more suggestive of recent myocardial infarction of the basal inferolateral LV wall with evidence of myocardial oedema. The infarct size is likely overestimated due to the presence of oedema. Follow-up CMR in 3 months is recommended to depict the exact size of the infarct. The remaining LV segments are viable. https://preview.redd.it/xg31fsyir01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3a4c54fcdfaef0a8fb25fbe197b1bba27bbaac7 https://preview.redd.it/kbe910sjr01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12659a31aec67bc65be7cc40305bdaaba0dfe1af https://preview.redd.it/ohapfkmkr01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62f343085352623d61fd38952436bba41fd9aa3 https://preview.redd.it/y7d0m9nit01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea27c067ea4b8d09c83eb6d561bb7bf6a18a2d7 https://preview.redd.it/wmgsjynjt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7507a875aeaa1c939c850ed0817857225f7a153 https://preview.redd.it/4pen9ggkt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00544f27097ac550741f16ea1eecd8ad26e2ffb0 https://preview.redd.it/21zfoublt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1946d3be17f1a902c931adae08899c9b335ac6c https://preview.redd.it/hof48b0mt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce3f08ca7933cd5fdbc6eb833a873ab7090987dc https://preview.redd.it/l2ci3xlmt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af62f446f7f9f527089e23b13db6d8393869b17 https://preview.redd.it/4vrcdv6nt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d241906abe6a66f8a0196ea7c55d04ccb797b9f https://preview.redd.it/76lmydtnt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9ee6c37b4921791f7ed3f0d579ba467e514ec7
