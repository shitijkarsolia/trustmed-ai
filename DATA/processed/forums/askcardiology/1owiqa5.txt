===============================================================================

Dr is worried about my RHR is at 35. She ordered a Holter monitor but I am waiting for approval from insurance. I did have a fall during Halloween which resulted in a concussion and ER vista. So I am wondering if this is more serious of an issue and I should skip this step and go to a cardiologist?

My heart rate was also low; it dropped to 35 to 40, and at night, it would go down to 27. I found out I have bradycardia, and my only symptom was shortness of breath. In the end, I got a pacemaker. Good luck.

I'd also get a pulse ox to check on your rate periodically. Are you able to keep an eye on your blood pressure? If your primary doctor has already ordered the test and is just waiting on insurance, I would go ahead and do that as soon as it is available. You're not going to get it done any sooner by waiting to see a cardiologist and then waiting on a new order for the test. Not many have quick available for new patients., but it depends. In the meantime, you can always try to make an appointment with a cardiologist. You will likely have the holter done and results in sooner than you can see the specialist, and then you'll have those results to take with you. But since your doctor is concerned, I imagine they want you seeing a cardiologist at some point anyway, so I'd probably get the ball rolling on that while you get the test done. If you experience fainting or dizziness along with the bradycardia (slow hr), go to the ER or call rescue.
