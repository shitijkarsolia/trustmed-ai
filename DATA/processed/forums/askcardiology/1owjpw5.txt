===============================================================================

i’ve been told i have early repolarization i have health anxiety and panic disorder im sure everyone here has seen the “increased risk” of SCA from early repolarization i can never seem to shake that fear. on oct 29,2025 i did a full blood work everything was completely normal including tropinin, i did an echo maybe 2-4 years ago don’t remember exactly when but cardiologist if i remember correctly said everything was normal (saying that because im sure if they found something they’d do more testing) some doctors tell me i have early repolarization and some doctors read my ecg and tell me i dont i just dont know what to do or what to think anymore. can anyone thoroughly read my ecgs and tell me whats going on?
