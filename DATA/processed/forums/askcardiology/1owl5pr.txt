The cold went away, and I still have the chest pain so I went in to do the EKG and this is what it showed I am concerned I know you guys are not professional doctors but I just wanna see personal opinions. I do not exercise all the time but I recently started because I wanna lose weight. I started eating better recently and just drinking pure water. I know I’m not gonna see results overnight, but I wanna know what could this chest pain be. I do not have no history of heart conditions. I don’t take no medications. I do snore when I sleep. I have been through a lot of stress in my life. I have been drinking a lot of alcohol. Can anyone give me their honest? On my EKG
