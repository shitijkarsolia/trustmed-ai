===============================================================================

Hypermobile interatrial septum is present with left to right shunt suggestive of PFO or secondum ASD. QP: QS at 0.97, normal pulmonary and systemic venous connections Attached is the summary from my cardiac MRI with contrast, the latest ECG at the cardiologists office, and my results from the ZIO heart monitor. I’ve had to push/ask the cardiologist I see for testing, I’ve had a super high heart rate (highest recorded was 267bpm) on a ZIO heart monitor. Would a PFO or secundum ASD potentially cause this? I’ve tried calling the cardiologists office, but it’s been a week and no call back. I received the results on the patient portal and have been investigating what my solutions are. I am going to leave another message and ask for a transesophageal echocardiogram, but are there any other tests that may help clarify? Thank you all.
