===============================================================================

I have been sick for 2 years; chest pain, brain fog, constipation, extreme fatigues cannot lose weight, rash on neck, high BP, vertigo, titinitus,Joint pain, headache. I get "flare ups" where it's worse, mostly summer. I have a large benign thyroid nodule. I have been to the rheumatologist, cardiologist and primary and they've ruled out MS, Lyme and cannot find anything else. I also have severe GERD so am seeing an GI MD for a barium. I will see my ENT Monday. What to ask? I went to my cardio last week and she said my heart is fine! I have had nuclear stress test and EEG and EKG. Also xrays.
