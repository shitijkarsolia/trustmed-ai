===============================================================================

Over the last few weeks, in the quiet hours of the early morning, I can hear my heart beating in my ears. It’s very subtle, but definitely there. A little background, I’ve recently lost over 100lbs fairly quickly and now a normal BMI. My blood pressure and pulse are normal (I’ve always had lower BP which I’ve thought was too low but I’m told it’s great/normal - like 92/58, 87/61, etc). My pulse is on the higher end of normal usually in the 90s sometimes the low 100s. I’m otherwise a very healthy woman of childbearing age. Is this something weight loss related? Or something to get checked out?

I hear mine periodically as I'm going to sleep and it helps me doze off. When you're in bed, your senses get more sensitive, especially hearing. Since you've lost weight, the sound is probably telegraphing through your bone mass more than previous. Note, I am a carpenter and not a doctor, I just am speaking up because I have experienced the same, and have all my life, and do not have any known heart problems.
