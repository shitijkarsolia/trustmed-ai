===============================================================================

Sudden changes in heart rate just sitting watching a comedy show at the theatre last night, these changes happen most days feel sudden with SOB, palpitations, tachycardia stop starts suddenly, lightheaded, pre syncope?! They can also start by eating spicy foods, coughing, going over bump in road, a full meal, holding my breath swimming, exertion, or bending, i’ve read this can be due to EAT?! Post ablation. anyone know much about this? NSH on echo, normal bloods, no other sig PMH
