Hey! I am a 17 year old male 6 feet and 115 kgs have been having this chest pressure or a similar kind of pain that I cant exactly describe from the past 4 months. It all started when I went to a physician for lower left abdominal pain and fever (the bp was 130/90) worried it was an infected appendix the doc advised a few tests blood test https://preview.redd.it/txyrfnzv2d1g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6413ee1e86a8e521faefbe9c606c60036b347e63 urine test https://preview.redd.it/k73wpxiy2d1g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c1fff285f4afde38ce5f44559b35cc273db557 abdominal ultrasound https://preview.redd.it/i0xbmxl03d1g1.jpg?width=2860&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3098090c46f657b27ce03c5c7a4bd100b106b665 and diagnosed the pain is due to an urinary tract infection and gave a prescription for nitrofurantoin and citralka (disodium hydrogen citrate syrup) which I think I overdosed on because after 2 days of following the prescription there was a painful left side chest and arm pain which started on day 2 evening and continued till the next day evening when I couldn't stand it anymore and went to the hospital again this time the following tests were done ekg https://preview.redd.it/iw094taw3d1g1.jpg?width=3900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b48d3fed19484ff0ecd9cacf37bd67987c6324 lipids https://preview.redd.it/2p7tkbhy3d1g1.jpg?width=2656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf8d7d72bd901051b4597ab3c1b2b7522bae511 serum creatinine https://preview.redd.it/a43ner124d1g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed299c7e883cc8c36e88fcd23baabaa5a2788044 and the blood pressure was 180/110 that day they discharged me back home and advised to take metprolol 25 mg daily. After 5 days of staying at home the pain did reduce but it was still there and I went to a interventional cardiologist to check again the initial tests were these https://preview.redd.it/ivx2h7sw4d1g1.jpg?width=2978&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd500d0ade663f42b213ce005741afe68cbd556d ekg https://preview.redd.it/ygydj7l05d1g1.jpg?width=3868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3df4945971465c45f388d83a72d3785f5919fcb3 electrolytes https://preview.redd.it/rkg0en935d1g1.jpg?width=2970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=682888acf36cd8691e413453faa164c5d01b7a6f urine test https://preview.redd.it/ay1w2uk65d1g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e1636a8a8867c1e7acc8c5b76a3e2877376010b and finally an trans thoracic echo https://preview.redd.it/vlakd0495d1g1.jpg?width=2878&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c05207a6f4ce78adc2be7dc397a0c4e3669fc2 https://preview.redd.it/53dmw9395d1g1.jpg?width=1922&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662abe2c1c6fb9e6a94105bb948d1f0fcba7a171 and after all these reports were normal it was advised that my bp was to be monitored for a week and it was around 125/75 at mornings 150/90 at midday after lunch and 130/85 at night after a week I went back and the doc advised to stop using metprolol and suggested lifestyle changes instead such as brisk walking daily and diagnosed it as anxiety and yes it might have been that as at that time I got my entrance exam results and so was very tensed for a month or so.The lifestyle changes also worked and I lost a few kgs of weight and came down to 110 kgs. The pain faded away and came back multiple times without any apparent reason even if I was resting and not engaged in activity but not severe enough that it caused me to take rest whenever I was engaged in activity over the past 4 months. And now from the past week I am having back pain which feels like some stretching of my skin on the surface and cant sleep comfortably on my back I have to sleep on either the left or right side. I am also having headache all over my head which feels like something is wrapped around my head and pain in my neck like under jawline whenever I turn my head left but its normal to turn right and there was the occasional chest pain as always. I took a BP reading last night and it was 155/94 (123hr) left arm 153/85 (113hr) right arm and after relaxing a bit and taking few deep breathes it was 140/85 (117hr) I was wondering if this is caused due to some serious condition like aortic dissection or aneurysm or other cardio conditions and need advice on next steps.
