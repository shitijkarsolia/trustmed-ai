===============================================================================

59F, mental health condition well-managed with medication. Also late menopause and hypothyroidism, all fine. BP normal. Very high cholesterol last summer, '24- though low triglycerides, Dr was very kindly frantic at my very elevated risk of heartattack. Changed mental health medication in the Fall with recurrence of symptoms, quickly titrated with serious insomnia and heart beats soaring or sometimes just very noticeable palpitations as apparent side effects. At that time was 250lbs, 5ft6in. All side effects faded except loss of appetite, happily lost 60lbs, now slowed but progressing. Endocrinologist added 20mg Crestor in Spring, cholesterol now normal. However, had 2 instances 4 months ago of severe left side upper body and jaw pain (chest and shoulder) at rest that faded in 4-5 min. My GP about few weeks later after second event said "not likely heart" but requested an ECG. It was reviewed by a cardiologist on staff thru the testing center and found normal. My Dr. has left it at that. Family history of cardiac is just 1 pacemaker and one HA after 85. I'm concerned? I want to train for a 10k charity run and lose more weight but should I ask to be referred to a cardiologist? Edited: does it makes sense to want more tests, information]?

The old adage is true better be safe than sorry especially if you're just starting out. A cardiologist can give you insight on where your exercise heart rate should be and what your heart rate should be in each zone as you vary the kind of workouts.
