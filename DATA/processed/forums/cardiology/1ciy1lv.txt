===============================================================================

IM PGY1 here having career questions. My program has the option to do a research year between PGY2 and 3 (seems mostly tailored for those in hardcore academia) and I am not sure if I should take a year or apply straight after 2nd year. At the end of the day I want to be a great clinician and prioritize that over research. Ideally I would like to match into a clinically rigorous place like Cedars/THI/CCF that has good research or a strong academic program with good clinical training. I am ok having research be 1/4-1/3 of my practice long term, but I don’t want to run my own lab or spend most of my time writing grants. I also don’t wanna succumb to the low pay and politics of hardcore academia but would like opportunities to collaborate on research projects when possible. At the moment I do enjoy research but do not want to dedicate my career to it I go to a T20 IM program, have solid board scores and a decent research profile (not a lot in cards yet) but am not sure if that will cut it for the competitive programs I mentioned. Would a research year and the connections that come with it be worth it for my application for the programs I’m shooting for? (I have no interest in doing a chief year and have heard hospitalist years can hurt for top cards programs?) Is prestige of fellowship program important for getting offers in PP (or just for academia)? Is a 70-30 clicinal/research position viable and is it obtained through academia or PP? Sorry for the many questions- happy to provide more details. TIA cardiotrons

The programs you mentioned aren't necessary at all (or anything particularly special) and even a place like THI isn't for research/academic types. A US MD at a top 20 residency with good board scores and solid extra-curriculars should have no problem matching at a solid academic program. Taking a year off for you would be a waste of time, for those programs and in general. Just be a good resident, a good person, build your resume and you'll be fine. I can't speak for academics as I'm employed community practice, but prestige isn't all that important in our hiring. And some of my colleagues do pursue academic/research but that's on their own time and money.

There are lots of programs that you can do great at. 2. The statement "I am ok having research be 1/4-1/3 of my practice long term..." it a little strange. The way things are going nowadays: either pay your salary with clinical service or pay your (much lower) salary by doing research. Yes, there is money and fulfillment to be achieved in successful research, but this is not an early-career goal. 3. At large institutions, you can find positions where you do research &lt;50% time, but this is usually either (1) seen as a liability by a potential employer or (2) something that you accomplish later on when you have a grant. If you are in an T20 program, doing well, get along with the cardiologists in your program and want to be mostly clinical, you should have no trouble getting into a fantastic cardiology program. Get through residency in 3 years. If you want to do a CMR year (which is far more valuable than a research year, but not necessary), do it. Either way...match into your cardiology program. If you decide to do research and want an extra year or so to get established, negotiate that with the cardiology program ONCE YOU ARE ALREADY THERE. Don't waste your time now.
