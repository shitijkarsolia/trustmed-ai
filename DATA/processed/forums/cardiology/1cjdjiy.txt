===============================================================================

I need help on how to classify an aortic dissection that I observed at an autopsy. There is a tear in the intima about 0.5 cm above the aortic valve and the right coronary artery is dissected. Would that be considered retrograde because the coronary ostia is proximal to the tear, or is it considered antegrade because the tear is in the ascending aorta and the coronary ostia is also in the ascending aorta? I understand the Stanford and DeBakey classifications, but don't know if those are used to determine retrograde and antegrade. Thanks!

Otherwise, the overwhelming probability is that it started in the aorta and the dissection was retrograde to the RCA. RCA STEMI is the most common coronary finding in acute aortic dissection.
