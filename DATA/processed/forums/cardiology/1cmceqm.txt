===============================================================================

Cards fellow here. I found myself torn if I should do IC or not. Unfortunately, I do have structural back issue which leads me to have back pain when I stand more than 30-45 minutes (with or without lead, not a lead related issue) hence the post. On one hand, I love procedures, like the job security and the extra income that IC brings. I am thinking to suck it up with back pain with NSAIDs, heating pads, lumbar support and do it then down-scale to general if I realize I can't do it anymore. I feel like most ICs are not taking on high-risk cases anyway, I can be happy with LHCs and ACS/PCIs here and there. Not thinking structural or peripheral work due to duration of those procedures. On the other hand, I feel like it is a bad way to start a new career this way, and I am worried that this would impact my health and also worried that I can't be good at it if I continuously avoid longer procedures. 'd also ideally would like to work in a tertiary care center, it seems like most of those places require coronary + a skill set per my research which would limit me further. I would be decently happy with non-invasive cardiology if it comes to that - I just really enjoy procedures and having rough time giving it up. I also do realize that non-invasive is a better lifestyle, with no radiation and related hazards so that would also be a plus. Mid-level creep and AI is bothering me with the non-invasive cardiology. To practicing ICs. What would you advice to me? Would you have gone into this career if you have existing back issue or do you think prioritizing health is more important.

In terms of $, I can make more as compared to my non IC partners by seeing more consults, reading echoes, stress, doing TEEs, etc. Reimbursement for procedures has taken a big hit. When I’m on call, I never have to go in and can be having dinner at a restaurant / with family, etc. Any emergency they call IC. Not to mention the risk of IC complications, which as a new attending, can get you in trouble and people are watching you like a hawk. Not the case with non IC. Other huge benefit I see with non IC is you own the patient. Everyone is scared when it comes to the heart and it’s an automatic pipeline of referrals. With IC and EP (unless you’re also doing a lot of general work) they are dependent on referrals from non IC. The opportunity cost of spending an extra 1-2 years has to be taken into account as well, easily 1M if 2 year extra training. Looking back I think I made the right choice. Stress level is a 0-1 with non IC and that’s a huge plus imo.
3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=9, created=2024-05-07T13:24:05]: I'm gen cards but I wouldn't mess around when it comes to health and especially back problems. It'll only get worse as you age. Gen cards already provides plenty job security and the income difference may not be all that much, especially for the effort, call and stress of doing IC. But remember that job security is from taking STEMI call, which you can't really control. You could have STEMI's rolling in, right after a day of doing cases. Gen cards you can still do TEE, LHC/RHC, maybe cardiomems. I have zero worries about midlevels and AI. I know people like to peddle this stuff but the fact is everyone freaks out about the heart, patients and doctors. No one wants to hand that off to a midlevel. Many other specialties would have serious midlevel issues well before cardiology does. There was a good discussion on AI a little while back and u/dayinthewarmsun made some excellent points that I fully agree with. AI doesn't worry me.

You can’t count on it being a simple pci 3. Procedures aren’t really that “fun” after a while 4. Complications carry more risk to your job security than any midlevel will ever. You get 3 bad cases (even if not your fault) before you can be fired.. then good luck on getting a job from there 5. Hard to be so incompetent as a Gen cards guy to get fired.. I know a whole lot more IC guys blacklisted then gen cards
5. u/saynocpr [score=7, created=2024-05-10T16:47:33]: IC here. TLDR, don’t do it. Lots of ‘anecdata’ comments, some well-intended but not generalizable or accurate. The main issue I see is that you would be unlikely to complete IC fellowship. Hours of daily case after case and because you would be in a teaching hospital expect CTO’s, high-risk PCI, etc which can run long. If you were to somehow be able to complete IC training without aggravating your back issue, a lot depends on the practice setting you then do. Your options would be narrower but there are IC docs working as essentially gen card docs with a bit of intervention on the side. However, you may then lose the $ advantage as the higher IC salary is driven by procedural volume. Keep in mind that a busy gen card doc will easily generate a higher RVU-driven salary than an IC on a below-average volume cath lab. On the other hand, on a relative equal work-volume IC still earns more. By MGMA median gen card is ~$600K vs $700K/yr. There is a major projected shortage of IC beyond that predicted for gen card due to QOL (perceived or real), higher number of IC’s retiring during or post-covid (theory is they were able to retire earlier), and limited number of IC fellowship spots not keeping up with demand. Invasive but non-interventional card is a legacy of the past likely to continue to die away as it is inefficient for all parties involved, except perhaps in rural areas where they Dx cath and transfer for PCI to a larger center. The APP encroachment is real and likely to continue. Cardiology has not been spared from it. My gen card colleagues seem to have more issues with it than we do. While they can see patients in clinic and the hospital effectively competing with them, for us they do “advanced” scut work allowing us to do more procedures and free up time in clinic seeing routine follwups. Lifestyle can be an issue but very personal. I have been doing this for more than 10 yrs now and still go excited after a long day of work at 3 am to the hospital to tackle the challenge of a complicated stemi. Every day I get to use my hands and get the immediate satisfaction of results (or the immediate and severe consequences of my potential mistakes). I would rather be on stemi call Q4 (as I do) and deal exclusively with shock and MIs than Q12 (as my partners do) and deal with AF-RVR and decomp CHF. If your back pain were lead-related and assuming you could survive fellowship, there are increasingly common options. I havent wore lead in years thanks to Zero Gravity. We recently evaluated Rampart and Nest which allows everyone in the lab (not only me) to not wear lead. Those IC’s who take care of themselves tend to do well. I am older but healthier / stronger in my back than when I started due to focus on my core, regular kettlebell training, etc. I do vascular so sometimes very long cases and this plus attention to ergonomics were a necessity. Hope this helps. Take care of yourself and your family as a priority. The rest is gravy.
6. u/shahtavacko [score=5, created=2024-05-07T15:10:40]: Do invasive cardiology, not interventional. I have been an invasive cardiologist for twenty years; I can hang up the catheter anytime I want, I just don't want to presently. If you are an interventional guy, most places depend on you being the IC or one of the few ICs, it won't be as easy to hang it up. Back issues will not go away, mine hasn't in decades, it will only get worse.
7. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=5, created=2024-05-08T03:02:02]: I don’t think you should do IC unless you want to do procedures. There are exceptions, but 90% of ICs in the US spend more than 50% time doing general cardiology. In most (not all) practice settings, IC and gen cards pay is similar (per RVU or hr worked). Furthermore, general cardiologists are in the highest demand. Unless you can do procedures that only a handful of people do (this does not really describe IC, even structural IC), your ‘job security’ is going to come from which patients you ‘own’. If you are busy in clinic and your patients trust you, then you become valuable to healthcare systems and hospitals. If you don’t do procedures, you’ll have to find other ways to diversify your career (teaching, admin, imaging, research, etc.) for the sake of sanity. This is very doable. What I recommend: considering all things (including back pain), will you be excited or fulfilled,to be called in for a STEMI? If so…go for IC. If not, don’t bother.
