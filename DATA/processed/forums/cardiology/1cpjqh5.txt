Hello! I am looking for non-ACGME fellowship programs. Does anyone know of any website similar to FREIDA that list such opportunities?

You'd have to do an individual search by subspecialty (e.g. heart failure, imaging etc) or state. More importantly, I'm not sure why you are looking for these non-accredited programs when you're only a PGY-1. You need to have completed residency first in order to have the clinical foundation and experience for the fellowship.
