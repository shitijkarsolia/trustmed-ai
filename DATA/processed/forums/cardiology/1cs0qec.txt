===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I'm a newly minted M4 and am coming close to making a final decision about what specialty to choose. I really like cardiac physiology, and like outpatient work. However, something important to me is being an "excellent" doctor. What I mean by that is someone who doesn't try to see patients as fast as possible, but someone who takes the time to treat patients in whatever way they need, as well as other ways that I'm currently having trouble figuring out how to put into words. I was wondering if this is possible in cardiology? What are some examples you can think of of an excellent cardiologist? And I don't just mean an excellent diagnostician, although that's a big part of it. I mean all around someone who you could call an excellent physician. Thanks in advance!

An excellent cardiologist can explain things in layperson terms and link it together to the treatment plan and medications. As an echo tech I have a cool screen and more time to explain stuff, so I do. Heart failure is a traffic jam. Blood moves slower in the body. The longer blood stays in one spot, the more various ions like sodium exit the bloodstream. Water follows salt because solutions always try to reach equilibrium. More sodium with a slow heart means more swelling in your legs and your lungs. I can't tell you how many times I've explained this to patients and have them tell me that now they understand CHF and why they need their meds. They'll also say they wish their doctor explained it like that. Angina is a muscle burn. If you tried to lift a 5lb weight every second of every day, then you would get to a point where you physically can't lift it anymore due to pain. Well that's what the heart is doing during an MI. I'll show patients the left atrial appendege on echo and explain that when blood stays stagnant, it clots like when you have a skin cut. Blood staying stagnant leads to clots so that's why you take an anticoagulant. It's all pretty simple to explain, but as a physician it becomes difficult to condense all your knowledge to lay person times in a 15 minute appointment. But it's possible, and the excellent docs I know can explain structural pathologies with real world analogies and basic explanations which in turn leads to better medication compliance.

What separates the excellent cardiologists (also applies to other specialties) from the average ones is how we interact with patients. Although it is often described as “empathy” (which I think is a misused term), the skill set involves listening to patients (they need to feel heard), establishing a relationship of trust, educating them and being able to negotiate a plan with them. Knowing “what to do” is usually very easy for a cardiologist (we have about 2 billion large clinical trials with clever names that tend to relegate debate to things that other specialties may consider “nuances”). Every patient is different. Some patients are comfortable with a ton of risk. Some want every pill that a podcaster has mentioned. Many have other significant medical or social problems and what you are seeing them for is not a priority in their lives. Some want you to tell them they don’t need surgery and to get the rest of their care from an acupuncturist. People are diverse. What I described above is extremely difficult to do on a regular basis unless you really care about your patients. You will burn out if you try to fake empathy too much. Just try to see each patient as if they were your sister, father, best friend, grandpa, etc. Spend a couple minutes getting to know them and understanding where they are coming from. Educate before prescribing. Treat every patient as a VIP. I know that these things take effort up front, but just keep in mind that that is how you would want a family member to be treated. In the long run, it also pays off. Follow up visits with a patient who trusts you tend to be quick and pleasant. The model of burning through patients every 5 minutes is not my cup of tea. You trade more money for misery and lack of fulfillment (not to mention poor patient care). I do not focus on speed or throughput. It took me a while in practice to determine how quickly I could see patients and still provide quality care (I also like getting to know my patients…I consider that to be part of my compensation). Even while focusing on this, and even while working for a large organization, I have found that it is still quite possible to make a decent income. I have to also add that the most fulfilling times in my career (other than turning a dying STEMI patient around…which always feels good) have been when I have earned a patient’s trust and a part in their life. I think that a good cardiologist (or oncologist) sometimes has to provide more than medical care. You provide encouragement and spiritual care too. You are the one that gets to tell patients: “I know your are scared, but this is no big deal”, “you have a serious condition but you are doing all you should, so go enjoy life” or “I am so sorry your _______ died, but please know that we all did everything possible to prevent that”. You have an opportunity with every patient interaction to relieve anxiety, be compassionate, remove burdens or simply let patients know that you hear them and they are not alone. In a word, you can “bless” them.

4. u/Wertyu25 [score=4, created=2024-05-14T15:13:58]: You can become an excellent physician regardless of which field of medicine you decide to pursue. Depth of medical knowledge and experience, procedural skills, application of medical knowledge to various clinical scenarios, professionalism, leadership, teamwork, efficiency and productivity, and communication skills are amongst the aspects of which an individual can master to become a successful and competent physician. However, I believe what sets apart a good physician from a great physician is bedside manner. Bedside manner goes beyond just being polite. It refers to development of the patient-doctor relationship though conducting yourself with tact, empathy, and humility in order to provide the best possible care to your patients. It involves clear communication by adapting complex information and explaining it in a manner with which the patient can easily understand. Genuine care, compassion, and concern for the wellbeing of those you treat will take you great lengths in your medical career. Choose a field you are passionate about and become a positive example and role model for younger physicians who come after you. Best of luck in your future endeavors!
5. u/way_beyond_me [score=2, created=2024-05-14T16:38:56]: I’m sorry that there have been no models of excellent cardiologists in your medical educational experience to lead you to ask such a question. Can’t say if I’m an excellent cardiologist but I’ve certainly worked with many. I would second what others have said: your field of specialty has very little to do with how ‘excellent’ you can be. Someone who excels in any specialty is someone who is willing to think critically about problems, take the extra step for a patient, even at the end of the day when things are tired and difficult. Someone who is excellent takes his or her craft very seriously, even (especially) the seemingly very simple things such as reading a 12 lead electrocardiogram, getting arterial access for an angiogram, reading through the past medical history very carefully, etc. Someone who is excellent is always willing to entertain the possibility that his or her prior diagnoses or plans of action are incorrect and should be revisited. Someone who is excellent is constantly staying abreast of advancements in the field and advocating for best practices in his or her place of work. Having said all this, I can’t think of a single medical specialty in which there isn’t a constant and lifelong series of decisions to be made which separate mediocrity from excellence. Best of luck to you!
6. u/TypeIII-RTA [score=2, created=2024-05-14T18:16:43]: Not a cardiologist and just in IM but imo more generally applicable but viewing the patient as a person and not as a disease you need to just fix. Many complex patients have a ton of comorbidities and social issues that underlie their inability to deal with their comorbidities which is why they ended up admitted in the first place. Your ability to identify and address all of that so that it decreases their risk of representing is what makes an excellent physician. We're not social workers but like its an integral part of medicine that we can't ignore and what separates the good from the average. Imo the average doc will just make an issues list, fix the problems and yeet the patient. That approach works well but its not gonna stop them from bouncing back. That's the baseline I expect of an IM physician. For cardio, its probably how you address the CV risk factors and how well educated your patients are about their own disease. Giving them a 30min lecture on CV pharmacology isn't really what's important. I feel a patient must actually understand what is wrong, how the meds work and what good it does them/harm if they don't take it to truly understand. That may take 10mins or 5h and until they get it, I don't think you should stop until they do. Like closed loop communication is pretty impt esp with pts. Before they get discharged you should also sit down and go through their admission + DC plan with them instead of letting the nurse do it. Also good time to assess their understanding after all the education you've given them. Spaced repetition ain't just for med students cramming anki but you can force patient's to do it as well. I feel HF subspecialists are probably the best at this because the bulk of their patients are chronic and will always come back so understanding is crucial. For EPs and ICs I feel the good ones are those who know when to refer out. Expectation is that everyone at baseline is good at their job cos you've done training for 3+3+2. Like if you can't manage you have to be able to swallow your pride and refer them to someone even within the same subspec that can. I've seen some really shit ones just hold on because they truly believe they're the absolute best at that one subpsec. Also managing patient's expectations from the get go seems to be really impt. Many seem to just be like yep this will fix ya right up and then when shit doesn't work out perfectly pt gets pissed
7. u/Standardkamelen [score=2, created=2024-05-15T08:47:43]: What I as a nurse in a cardiac intensive care-unit value is; 1. Competence to know when an action should be taken and when the right choice is to abstain. An ambitious doctor knows that Levo can help the squeeze of a chronic CHF patient, an excellent doctor knows when it’s time to let go and not indulge the patient in further hope for recovery. 2. Willingness to share knowledge with the team and value and respect the worth of good teamwork. It’s a a practice that saves the doctors time in the long run and it boosts the team when they feel appraised and important. 3. Compassion and educational skills as mentioned by another poster. 4. Good skills with practicalities such as a-lines, central lines, pleural drainage and other things that can make a major difference within a short period of time. 5. Humility and honesty about what they don’t know and when they need help. Sorry for the possibly deranged medical english, not my first language.
8. u/Past-Many-4190 [score=2, created=2024-05-16T16:59:28]: Excellent in cardiology means staying up to date on newest treatment guidelines, being great at whatever cardiac skills you obtain ecg/ echo/ cath/ EP etc, but the “lane” for cardiology is heart conditions. Being able to stay focused on that role and guiding pts to other specialist who can answer the questions they request of you. Knowing your limits. Building rapport with patients and colleagues. But having a sense of these are my skills to help cardiac patients - I will do what I can to help you. Also an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We can’t wave magic wands. I hope people know smoking cessation is one of the biggest actions to take keep heart healthy; along with being compliant with medications and keeping follow up appointments. Also I really appreciate the Cardiologist who are consistent, they show up and do the work. Best wishes with the decision making - there’s lots of cardiac needs.
9. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2024-05-15T09:46:52]: Of course it's possible in cardiology. What makes an excellent cardiologist is what makes an excellent doctor in general. In my experience, knowing your stuff and actually caring puts you pretty high up there already.

11. u/Ok-Cloud3462 [score=1, created=2024-05-21T16:41:45]: In my opinion, a good cardiologist fixes the heart and saves the life…no talking necessary!!! Case closed.. There is no time … when you are presented with a person who is dying..you can chat later only if they are saved..by you and your team..
12. u/Ok-Cloud3462 [score=1, created=2024-05-21T16:47:46]: One add on, if you are good than you are good, but if you have to try to be good then you probably aren’t that good…
13. u/AccomplishedClue1753 [score=1, created=2024-05-26T18:49:06]: Like others have said a large corporation like kaiser or a university clinic is going to abuse the shit out of you and make you cram patients into small time windows. Try to land a job in private practice that allows you to have some say about how much time is allotted for a new consult or follow up. ***What patients perceive as a memorable , good doctor, is really the amount of time spent, and care shown for sitting down face to face, explaining, shared decision making, educating, and trying to understand the context of their symptoms. unfortunately the amount of time spent we have for these critical and fundamental conversations is often not possible in insanely busy practices where the management does not know a thing about medicine
14. u/merryklein [score=1, created=2024-06-04T12:51:05]: In case it is helpful to hear from a patient/family perspective- my dad has had a complicated cardiac history and we have been blessed that he has received care from excellent physicians who have saved his life. Other than the medical care they have provided, they update him (and us) regularly and in ways that we can understand. They see my dad as a whole person and listen to him authentically, while addressing concerns. This approach has helped my dad feel comfortable with procedures recommended by his team that he initially did not want to do. Rather than feeling “forced” or pushed they were able to create a level of connection so he could feel respected and ultimately ready for the treatment approach. It was a very stressful time but I felt better knowing that he was in good hands. As a family member it is really scary to have a loved one with heart issues, and at the end of the day all you have for comfort is the knowledge that they are connected to the best medical team and a true belief that they will do everything in their power to help.
