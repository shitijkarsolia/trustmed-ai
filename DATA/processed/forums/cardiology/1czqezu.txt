===============================================================================

(...+ symptoms + optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months + good functional status etc) Not a cardiologist but I'm a UK doctor preparing a talk on cardiac devices and I can't find a source for this anywhere. Ideally, would like a table or graph of some sort. I'm guessing the majority of ICD implantations are for this indication (as opposed to high risk inherited conditions or secondary prevention) but would like to know an actual rough percentage or statistical breakdown of indications. Can anyone help me find a source? Don't mind US or UK (or basically any country) as long as it's actual data. Failing this, I'll gladly take anecdotal data/estimations. Thanks in advance!

2. u/Ornery_Jell0 [score=2, created=2024-05-24T18:54:51]: Older data but I see [this](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.111.000054) cited a lot. Looks like ~75-80% implanted for primary prevention. *typo
