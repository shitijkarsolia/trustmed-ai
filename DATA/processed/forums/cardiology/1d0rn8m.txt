===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I am a PGY-2 at one of the larger university programs (\~top 20-30). Being an IMG from Europe, I am currently training on an H1B visa, though I had my NIW approved last year and am pending submission of adjustment of status for my green card, which should hopefully be finalized early 2025 (so before fellowship would start). My question is: How risky is it to apply this year being on the H1B visa, or how much higher would my chances be applying while having the green card? I am aiming for a larger university program. (Stats: Steps 256/246/230, &gt;10 pubs). Thanks for your help!
