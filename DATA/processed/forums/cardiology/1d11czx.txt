I feel like I’m missing something important. This is my current understanding of membrane potential and cellular depolarization: When a cell depolarizes due to an influx of Na+ ions, the vast majority of the intracellular fluid is unaffected. Depolarization/repolarization is really only referring to the area directly inside the membrane, and the total concentration of ICF Na+ ions only changes by a fraction of a percent during these events. How are we able to record de/repolarization on something like an EKG? On a large scale, wouldn’t the shift in polarity within the ICF be cancelled out by an equal and opposite shift in the ECF?

When this wave of positive charges moves towards a positive electrode, there is simultaneous upward deflection recorded by the EKG. It is the vector of the flow of the positive charge. I think Dale Dubin's Rapid Interpretation of EKG explains it well
