===============================================================================

I was reading about heart mechanics and came across the formula, wall stress= wall tension/(2×thickness). Before this I had just assumed wall stress and tension were synonymous, but after seeing the formula I got confused. Logically to me, wall tension, like in physics, means the longitudinal stress each myocardium experiences in the direction parallel to it's own longitudinal axis in the plane which it occupies. However I am unable to extrapolate this explanation to figure out what wall stress is. Could someone guide me a bit to understand this intuitively?? Also!! Is it correct to understand wall tension is the force of contraction generated by the cardiac muscles?

1. u/Whatifjunkie [score=2, created=2024-05-30T07:42:24]: Wall tension is a measure of the force that the walls must resist in order to generate contractions or eject blood from the ventricles during each heartbeat. Wall stress refers to the changes in pressure throughout a cardiac cycle and how this affects cardiac muscle mechanics during contractions.
