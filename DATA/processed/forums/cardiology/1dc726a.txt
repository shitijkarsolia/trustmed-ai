Hey everyone, I just wanted to drop a question as I'm looking to do my masters however, just needed a little advice. I have an opportunity to do a post graduate degree in Echocardiography at one of the top cardiac hospitals in the UK. But at the same time I have the opportunity to do Cardiac Physiology too. My question was, what is the difference between the two and which one would you suggest I do. Is the pay any different in the two roles when I start applying for jobs later or is it the same? And what is your day to day life like completing either one of those roles? Thanks a lot for your help!! Appreciate it!

Out of curiosity, what is the post graduate degree in echo? Do you mean the ETP, or is it something different? It really depends, if you would like to specialise in echo, and never switch, and then further specialise in TOE or congenital etc, then go for the echo training, it’ll be much faster to get a higher hand of pay and seniority. However, you’ll be a much more rounded professional if you do cardiac physiology, I’m assuming this is through the scientist training programme. The STP is a very good course, in which you get paid band 6 while training for 3 years and you will cover ecg analysis, exercise testing, tilt table testing, bp monitoring and ambulatory ecg monitoring, pacemaker checks and implants, cath lab work ranging from angiogram left and right heart, to PCI and electrophysiology. Then I’m your third year you specialise in echo or pacing. STP route: we’ll rounded, more exposure, do t have to choose speciality right away, band 6 and you can expect to be a band 7 after you finish / 1 year after you finish. ETP: Band 6 for 18 months then band 7 after that, echo only. You’ll learn basic ecg analysis too. I did the degree apprenticeship, I already had a masters of research in cardiac arrhythmia intervention and the ETP, so it was basically a 4.5 year version of the STP haha. Hope this helps, feel free to ask anything. Edit: apologies for typos on my phone at the moment.
