Hi everybody! I am a college student in NYC with an interest in pursuing cardiology. I have been having some difficulty finding someone to shadow and was wondering if there are any cardiologists in the NYC region who would be willing to let me shadow them? I am particularly interested in interventional cardiology, so if there are any interventional cardiologists available, that would be wonderful. However, my main goal is to gain more exposure to the field of cardiology, so I would be incredibly grateful for any shadowing opportunity. Thank you so much for your time.

What year in college? It’s ok to shadow, but I would probably focus your energies on your med school application rather than shadowing a random IC. If the shadowing is *for* the application, then shadow anyone you have access to. Just my 2 cents. Good luck. Cardiology is the best field, but you have many years before you need to make that decision
