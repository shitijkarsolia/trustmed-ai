Hey everyone, Was wondering if there is any advice you can share to a rising intern interested in cardiology. I know how competitive matching is, so any advice on how to increase my chances will be much appreciated. For context, I’m a USMD attending a mid tier academic program. Step 2: 263. No cardiology research. Thanks!

Make sure that the cardiologists at your program know you and that you are interested in cardiology. If your program has a cardiology fellowship program, it would not be inappropriate to email the fellowship PD and ask them if you can meet with them for advice.
2. u/Wyvernz [score=4, created=2024-06-16T05:23:13]: Try to find out which cardiologists at your institution are most productive in research and let them know you’re interested in cardiology and available to help out. They likely will have ongoing projects that need more manpower which is an easy way to get your foot in the door and name on some publications/book chapters. Even better is if you can find out their broad area of research and come up with your own project in that area (probably something retrospective or a meta-analysis since starting and finishing a prospective project in 3 years is unlikely to work out and risky to attempt).
3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2024-06-16T08:32:00]: I'd also reach out to other co-residents interested in cardiology or fellows (if your hospital has them) for advice, connections or projects. Attendings can be slow and unreliable and fellows may already have projects running that they could use your help with. If you intend on applying in 1yr, you don't have much time to get something down on your resume. Also they can point you to the good attendings to work with or get a LOR from.

5. u/mazeltovmayer [score=1, created=2024-06-29T09:17:33]: Hey OP, I’m in the same boat as you (same stats and residency tier). For anyone else in the sub, I’ve heard “connections” are important - how do you go about networking in the field. I never want to come off as a try hard or disingenuous or not loyal to the cardiologist at my own program, but have heard it’s important in the long run. Any thoughts?
