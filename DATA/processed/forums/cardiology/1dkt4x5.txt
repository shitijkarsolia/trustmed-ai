===============================================================================

Hello — I am a 4th year medical student making (very late) final decisions about what specialty to choose (residency apps due 9/25 of this year). I have always been attracted to surgery, particularly for the opportunity to provide a distinct solution to a patient's condition with a distinct intervention. No watching a waiting. No tinkering. More certainty of impact. I also really like the OR and definitely believe it (or a procedure suite) is my favorite place to be in the hospital, head and shoulders above the rest. This being said, I really like medicine decision-making, once I feel confident in it. I discovered this while rotating on inpatient cardiology one year ago as part of my internal medicine clerkship. I got much more confident in GDMT tweaking and ACS work-up algorithms. I found it fascinating, much more so than making decisions on whether or not to operate on a stone-ridden gall bladder or an angry hernia. However, inpatient cardiology, of course, lacked the distinct procedural fix of surgery. The more I've looked into the reality of the field, however, the more I've learned about the breadth of distinct procedural interventions cardiologists can offer, once they've completed advanced fellowships (interventional, structural, peripheral vascular): angioplasties, valvuloplasties, septum defect repairs, impella LVAD placements, etc. I've even learned that some of these (many) can be scheduled, which has piqued my interest event more. I'm curious if anyone can speak to how feasible it is for people to set up their workload / schedule (with the right fellowships having been completed) to "mirror that of a surgeon's," in that a majority of their working hours are dedicated to performing procedural interventions in the interventional suite (with, of course, the understandable clinic time and peri-procedural care).

Even then I'm not sure how many IC spend a *majority* of their time in the lab. I wouldn't go into IC banking on getting one of those jobs. You're more likely to have a job that is lots of clinic, gen cards and dealing with complaints of chest pain, palpitations, etc. with a day, maybe 2, of lab time. Cardiology is still medicine in the end and even IC does a lot of it so you should certainly like that aspect as well. The nice thing about IC is that you can always cut back to gen cards if you want a better lifestyle or less physical exertion with minimal impact on pay. But if the OR/lab is your "home", then I'm not confident IC will satisfy you. If anything, within IM it seems GI could be one of those specialties where you're always doing procedures. Certainly some practices around me seem to operate that way.

It is two additional years of training after cardiology but heavily procedural and all cases are elective/better lifestyle than ic. Like ic, pure ep jobs may be tough to come by and may still have to do some general call, so need to take that in to consideration.

Our ICs are all so amazing, the work they do is incredible and they’re some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. However, their call burden is so heavy. Night call is Q4. Cover caths over the weekends about once every month and a half. Each one will run our inpatient service for the week every month and a half which usually entails 12-14 hour days. Like someone above said, we have a couple who went to just Gen cards. They’ll do just clinic and do some weekend rounding every so often. They got a tough job. Paid VERY well, but it comes with a cost.
