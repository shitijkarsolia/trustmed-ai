===============================================================================

Hello — I am a 4th year medical student making (very late) final decisions about what specialty to choose (residency apps due 9/25 of this year). I have always been attracted to surgery, particularly for the opportunity to provide a distinct solution to a patient's condition with a distinct intervention. No watching a waiting. No tinkering. More certainty of impact. I also really like the OR and definitely believe it (or a procedure suite) is my favorite place to be in the hospital, head and shoulders above the rest. This being said, I really like medicine decision-making, once I feel confident in it. I discovered this while rotating on inpatient cardiology one year ago as part of my internal medicine clerkship. I got much more confident in GDMT tweaking and ACS work-up algorithms. I found it fascinating, much more so than making decisions on whether or not to operate on a stone-ridden gall bladder or an angry hernia. However, inpatient cardiology, of course, lacked the distinct procedural fix of surgery. The more I've looked into the reality of the field, however, the more I've learned about the breadth of distinct procedural interventions cardiologists can offer, once they've completed advanced fellowships (interventional, structural, peripheral vascular): angioplasties, valvuloplasties, septum defect repairs, impella LVAD placements, etc. I've even learned that some of these (many) can be scheduled, which has piqued my interest event more. I'm curious if anyone can speak to how feasible it is for people to set up their workload / schedule (with the right fellowships having been completed) to "mirror that of a surgeon's," in that a majority of their working hours are dedicated to performing procedural interventions in the interventional suite (with, of course, the understandable clinic time and peri-procedural care).

1. u/STEMI_stan [score=1, created=2024-07-23T03:28:36]: Internationalists in my place do 3.5-4 days of lab per week. 1 day admin and 0-1 day clinic. They also have the option to attend in the ccu or floors. It’s also more pleasant than surgery imo
