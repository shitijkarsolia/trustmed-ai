Hi all! I'm an IM intern who will be starting my first day of residency on Cardiology Wards. I'm interested in Cards and thus really want to make a good impression, but... it has been quite a while since I've done a real rotation and I'm quite rusty. My question for you is - what would you expect of a first rotation intern starting on cards (other than just being a good/helpful person). Are there any resources you can point to that would be worth reviewing in the week or so I have until I start on the wards? Thanks in advance for the help/tips!

Know your patients. 4. Show respect for your patients, teammates and attending. Act in a way that shows you are taking things seriously and can be trusted. Dress appropriately. Be on time. Follow up on things. 5. When things come up that you don’t know, read about them and ask clarifying questions about what you have read rather than just asking your resident/fellow/attending without putting in effort yourself. I have so much more interest in the intern/resident who says “I was reading about inotropes and vasopressors and it seems that milrinone and dobutamine have similar effects. Why did we choose dobutamine for this patient?” All of the above is really just general advice. For cardiology specifically, there are a couple of things to keep in mind if you want to excel above and beyond… 1. We love our clinical trials. Although there is a lot to be learned from doing a deep-dive into a trial, at least try to know the one-liner for some of the key clinical trials. You can google for lists/apps/etc. for this. [Here is a good (13 year out of date) list](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/WikiJournalClub:List_of_landmark_papers/Cardiology). You don’t need to know all of them. If you hear your attending mention RACE, COPERNICUS or PARADIGM-HF, learn what those showed. They will likely come up again and again. 2. When you don’t know what to do, take a look at the ACC/AHA guidelines. They are a really good starting point to give you context and understanding. 3. Know the cardiology data: Last echo findings, last ecg findings, today’s telemetry, other cardiac studies (angiograms, CMR, CT, nuclear stress testing, etc). What heart procedures has the patient has? Current doses of cardiac meds. This is on top of things like current vitals and labs, that you always need. You need to know the cardiac findings/history even if not from current admission.
2. u/redicalschool [score=3, created=2024-06-20T20:36:35]: Something that can be really helpful is starting to hone your history taking skills and developing a solid presentation. These will both come with time and may take a long time to fully manifest. Be honest when you don't know something, be engaged and you will get good reviews. A diligent student that is able to take a good history is truly helpful; a student that lies, is deceptive about aspects of the history or makes excuses is a liability and can hinder teams significantly. Good luck, you'll do great, if for no other reason than you care enough to ask and be proactive!
3. u/supadupasid [score=2, created=2024-06-20T23:30:54]: Honestly a good presentation. Expectations arent high. Chest pain, afib and heart failure- if you can read up on those, then youll come off as maybe impressive haha. If not, youll learn a lot and get better throughout rotation.
4. u/DianeMarieG [score=2, created=2024-06-23T13:08:26]: I've never forgotten what my first cardiology mentor expected me to know about every patient: pump, plumbing and electricity. Know your patient's EF, know their EKG/tele, know when their last ischemic work up/cath was and what the results were. Do they have stents? If yes, where? CABG? Which vessels were bypassed? I'll also add, if they are on AC, what is if for? Same if they are on antiplatelets/DAPT. Not all indications are cardiac so don't make assumptions.
5. u/footbook123 [score=1, created=2024-06-20T19:35:32]: I’m in the exact same situation. Curious as well
6. u/cee_gee_ess3000 [score=1, created=2024-06-20T20:18:52]: The main thing you can be is available and on time, honestly. You aren’t going to be expected to know much. But you will be expected to present. Know common treatments for CHF. Guidelines directed medical therapy for it. Make sure you are looking at the telemetry every morning, even if you don’t really know what you are looking for. Befriend the monitor tech quickly and ask them about alarms/events overnight. I’m sure others can add more, but if you can do those things, you’ll be better off than most day 1
7. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2024-06-21T09:03:42]: Know your patients, be nice, be attentive, do your job well, then followed by knowing your medicine. It's amazing how many can't get the first 4 things right. Don't downplay it because that's what people remember most. No one reasonably expects much from you otherwise and I'm sure you've done some cardiology in med school to give you a decent base.
