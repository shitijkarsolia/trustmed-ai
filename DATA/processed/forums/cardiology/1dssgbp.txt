2. u/lagniappe- [score=3, created=2024-07-01T19:20:19]: Yes there appears to be an accessory pathway. Question was pre excited afib versus VT.
3. u/Tricky_Feedback1093 [score=3, created=2024-07-19T10:33:55]: You know how I knew it was VT in one sec. First of all, VT is way more common (85%) and secondly, I immediately saw the capture/fusion beat in the middle of the rhythm and knew that it was VT.
4. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2024-07-02T01:21:29]: Noticed the notched waves in avf and V2
