===============================================================================

USDO, 243/237 Steps (no Step 3), COMLEXs 500s. Graduated from a university affiliated community program. I failed to match first time with 3 interviews (I interviewed at 2 new programs after March season with updated LORs). I was invited to interview for a PGY-4 Chief Resident position at another program in my home state (in house fellowships) that I ultimately accepted. During PGY-3 year I added on more abstracts and research as well. This time around I have only 1 IV thus far and while maybe I’ll get a few more I likely won’t match again. Last year I thought my one faulty LOR was the issue, I upgraded and revamped my LORs but not getting the traction I’d have hoped. I was considering my last option is be a hospitalist at either this program and spend 1-3 years getting to know the program and suicide match or other option is find another 1 year fellowship but run the risk of failing to match for a third time and waste 2 years in total not making an attending salary. I also applied to Pulm/Crit as a backup and have 2 IVs now also. I can DM my CV to anyone that can help.

A lot of these fellows are able to match into general cardiology fellowship later. Personally, I feel most of these programs are turning them into cheap labor but if it gets you to your goal, it may not hurt.
2. u/ThoracicInlet [score=3, created=2024-08-18T12:54:39]: I’m applying first time right now as a USDO as well so this is scary to hear. Did you apply to every program in the nation? I think if it doesn’t work out this year consider job as a hospitalist at an institution you’re targeting that is DO friendly and make connections by doing research. Don’t give up on your dream! Good luck.

5. u/parachute45 [score=2, created=2024-09-11T16:06:33]: Did you end up getting more interviews?? Hope you did! When I first read this I too just had my home program's but after having mentors reach out I have a handful more
6. u/magicalmedic [score=1, created=2024-08-18T15:23:24]: You seem to have a strong application. I'm not sure how much you have explored this but perhaps reaching out to your cardiology attendings and see who can call for you once you receive more interviews (its still a little early). Also please present your publications at ACC or TCT or ASE, etc. Really use the network you have cultivated to your advantage. Most of your mentors and attendings want to see you succeed. Finally for every interview I get, I would HIGHLY recommend doing a "second look" in person, this tells the programs that you are serious about joining them.
7. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2024-08-19T18:56:30]: If you want you can send me your CV. May be I can be off some help. dm me if you want to.
