===============================================================================

One of the compensatory responses to heart failure (and the accompanying reduction in cardiac output) is for the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to activate. While this has myriad effects, one that is described in most cardiac pathophysiology textbooks (eg, Lilly) is that the activation of the SNS causes peripheral vasoconstriction, raising the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). However, I don't understand why the body would do this. The underlying problem in HF is a reduction in cardiac output (either due to diastolic or systolic failure). Raising SVR (using the cardiac equivalent of Ohm's Law: Pressure = CO x SVR) would either a) cause cardiac output to drop, holding pressure constant or b) force the heart to generate more pressure to generate to maintain a constant CO. Both seem like poor responses to a failing heart. So why does the body do this? Put otherwise, if I had independent control over every hemodynamic parameter in the body and I was confronted by a failing heart, my solution would be to increase HR and contractility (which the SNS does), but to vasodilate the systemic arterioles to lower resistance and thus (by Ohm;s Law once again) reduce the pressure the heart would need to generate in order to drive the same amount of flow as prior to the heart failure. Why is this a bad idea? I think there are some preliminary questions that might help clear up my confusion. They are probably very basic, but I think they will help clear up the confusion I face. A. Why is blood pressure (specifically mean arterial pressure, measured at the aorta) important to maintain? The goal of the heart is to maintain tissue perfusion, which seems to me to be function of the volume of blood which gets to a certain organ? B. Does the body regulate blood pressure or cardiac output? If both, which takes priority?

That means maintaining Q (flow, or volume of blood per time). Going back to Ohm’s law, you get Q = ΔP / R. Raising aortic pressure increases ΔP and, therefore increases Q, or volume delivered per time. Dropping R can also increase Q, but you can only do that so much (there is a minimum intrinsic SVR and some organs—kidneys—require a certain pressure to function). That means that aortic pressure becomes a key driver of Q. In a healthy heart, there is cardiac reserve: contractility, stroke volume and heart rate can all increase, resulting in a higher cardiac output. This means that all three components of Ohm’s law can change dynamically through a number of homeostatic feedback loops. For instance, an increase in SVR may cause an increase in ΔP but also trigger increased Q through more contractility and stroke volume. The mechanisms result in some sort of equilibrium to perfuse tissue appropriately. The key term above is “healthy”. In heart failure, the key problem is that cardiac output, Q, cannot be increased because there is no cardiac reserve. Q becomes a constant. That means that changes in ΔP are directly offset by changes in R with no net benefit. The homeostatic feedback loops that are well-tuned and work so well with a healthy heart are not effective. Worse, they cause harm by increasing pressure and wearing out the failing heart faster. This is a key problem in heart failure. 2. I think it is inappropriate to think of “the body” regulating and prioritizing things as if a centralized decision maker were engineering every physiologic change. We have all kinds of feedback mechanisms that interact and change all three components of Ohm’s law constantly. These mechanisms are what maintains homeostasis. When a major part of the system (the ability to increase cardiac output) fails, these feedback systems do not work as intended. That’s why heart failure patients need doctors. We become the decision makers and we use drugs to override, reengineer and re-tune all those feedback mechanisms in order to prioritize changes that we, with our rational brains, know can help. This is pretty much what all HF drugs are for.

3. u/vy2005 [score=2, created=2024-08-30T08:36:46]: This confused me for a long time, you have the same issue in septic shock, why are we raising resistance (SVR) with pressors if we want to increase blood flow to vital organs? The thing to understand is that raising SVR does not affect all organs equally. Vital organs (heart, brain) will be prioritized when SVR is raised whereas blood flow will be shunted away from less important tissues (skin, gut, kidney), so even if cardiac output is marginally decreased by an increase in SVR, cardiac output to vital organs will be improved. Or at least that's how it's been explained to me
4. u/spicypac [score=1, created=2024-09-01T11:56:16]: The explanations put forth are great so I won’t go on, plus I’m by no means an expert. But I always think that part of the effort is that the body is also concerned about keeping the kidneys perfused. The age old problem with acute decompensated heart failure is all those old patients who have AKI secondary to pre-renal issues of adequate perfusion. Enter the RAAS, SNS who are going to freak and drive up the SVR. This is a GROSS over simplification and probably not 100% accurate but I swear to god the heart and kidneys are like some toxic couple that just bring each other down when one isn’t doing well 😂
5. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2024-09-17T02:50:24]: There is no evolutional response to heart failure. It is too new a disease for us to have any evolutional adaptation to it. We have no physiological adaptation newer than 5,000 years ago. Our most recent evolutionaly adaptation to disease is probably sickle cell for malaria. Our response to a falling cardiac output is exactly the same as to dehydration, and traumatic injury. Vasoconstrict and develop an antidiuresis to keep BP and flow going and don't waste precious fluids by peeing it out.. It helps me understand all physiological responses if I remember none of them are in rsponse to modern disease.
6. u/br0mer [score=1, created=2024-09-18T05:01:21]: Pathophysiologically, heart failure is sensed as a dehydration state to the kidneys. Once you view it as that, you can see the physiologic response makes more sense.
7. u/ferasius [score=1, created=2025-10-21T12:06:17]: Evolutionarily we are designed to cope with having our legs ripped off by a lion (ie. Hypovolaemic shock), and would never live long enough to see our hearts fail (cardiogenic shock). This means our body can’t tell the difference between the 2, and always assumes we’re about to bleed out.
