===============================================================================

I’m currently going through interventional cardiology match and I’m very confused about ranking. I recently interviewed at a program and loved it but a friend of mine who was a fellow there told me it’s toxic work environment with not good training How do I know if a fellowship program is toxic? Also can people write what IC programs are good and not good (your personal experiences) Thank you so much in advance

If that means that they make you do tons of cases and take STEMI call often…well…that’s what you want…so good. If malignant means that you do few cases and mostly scut work…that should be a hard no. If they are dragging one year of cases out over two years…that’s a no too. Unlike all earlier phases of training, 99% of IC year is just about seeing and doing lots and lots of cases. You don’t want to skimp on that. Remember that other proceduralists (surgeons) have 4-8 years to more-or-less only develop procedural skills. You only have 1-2 years. Aside from getting enough procedures, everything else is “extras” that depend on your interests and goals. Is it a 1 or 2 year program? Are there options to be qualified to do structural and/or peripheral (if you are interested in those)? Is it an academic program (mostly only matters if you wish to stay academic)? Is it in the region you want to end up?
2. u/AX_201 [score=4, created=2024-09-16T15:25:32]: n of 1, so take it with grain of salt. It seems to be a crapshoot. Unless you are going to a well-established program with long-standing reputation for being excellent or not so excellent, everything in the middle of that spectrum can vary greatly and unpredictably. Staff leave at the drop of a hat, turn over in many places is high, systems are currently merging and transforming, volumes can fluctuate. Worst of all, people lie either intentionally or not - what you may be promised during your interview may be night and day compared to your actual experience as an IC fellow. What served me well was looking for a place that seems to have decent, solid people, that are willing to teach. Equally important is procedural volume, the kinds of procedures that are done, and your role in the lab. Things that were red flags were attendings that were dismissive during interviews or just plain disinterested, miserable IC fellows, or word of mouth about fellows struggling to get case loads or being overworked. Other things to look out for is call burden, support from and quality of the general fellowship, burden of presentations/research/admin tasks, number of IC fellows, where IC fellows end up afterwards, livability of the city you are in, interactions between the IC attendings, culture of the program, etc. Your best bet is finding fellows at the programs which you are interested in and asking them directly what their experience is/was like. I found most people to be generally open about it.
3. u/jiklkfd578 [score=4, created=2024-09-16T20:42:07]: It all comes down to case volume and the autonomy you get during procedures. Main two questions you have to ask about (to current fellows).
4. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2024-09-17T11:30:16]: It is just 1 year. 365 days. Tough it out.
5. u/dontdo_that [score=2, created=2024-10-08T22:28:51]: It is extremely important that you chose a program where fellows feel their time is well spent and that they feel supported. The activities you participate in should be educational. Avoid programs with scut work, where you are filling the role of a general cath fellow (e.g. disproportionately high volume of non-interventional cases like diagnostic and RHCs). Every minute spent in the lab has the potential to be educational, but too much low yield work will detract from your focus on what matters. If a current fellow there is unhappy, see if you can get connected with other prior fellows and solicit their feedback. 1 year is not a lot of time to learn a ton of important skills. You will never be tested in your Cardiology career as much as you will with that coding STEMI on your table at 2 AM, and you want confidence in situations like that at the end of your year.
