2. u/AdventureIsOutThere3 [score=5, created=2024-09-17T13:48:19]: Practical Cardiovascular Medicine by Elias Hanna is a really good book that provides a good foundation but not overly difficult to read. If your program has access to Mayo Clinic Board Review videos those would be a good resource as well as they do a good job incorporating guidelines which are important to know clinically and for boards.
