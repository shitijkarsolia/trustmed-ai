Does getting Diplomate status really matter for a cardiology career? I see many practicing cardiologists have the Testamur from the physician verification website, but not many have the Diplomate status. Slightly unrelated question: who should consider getting the title of fellow of the American Society of Echocardiography (FASE)?

1. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2024-09-18T07:23:02]: It depends where you will practice. 90%+ of places just require COCATS 2 level of competence and don’t require ASE diplomat status/certification. However, you may need this certification to (1) lead a certified echo lab or (2) at certain (typically academic) institutions if you want to read echos. I haven’t seen the testamur status used for anything (except to prove that certification is pending).
