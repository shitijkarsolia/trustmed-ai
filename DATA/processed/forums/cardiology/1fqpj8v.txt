===============================================================================

I am currently interviewing for cardiology fellowship and deciding on my rank list. There has been alot of talk about going to a place with good volume. How important is this really for general cardiology training. I can see how this will matter for things like interventional or EP or imaging. But for general cardiology how big is having volume. Also how is this volume measured? Specifically people have talked down the Havard programs because of what they call "low volume". Is anyone familiar with this topic and can talk more about it?

1. u/redicalschool [score=5, created=2024-09-27T10:06:12]: Volume is important, but so is diversity of pathology and resources available. For example, my program is relatively high volume in many regards. We see a lot of inpatients and do a lot of procedures. BUT, we also ship a couple patients out per week for complex VT ablations, transplant evals/mechanical circulatory support, laser lead extractions, etc. So having good "volume" isn't the end-all be-all, because there are a few things we will have minimal to no exposure to as we go into practice if we don't further specialize. We will have a strong foundation in bread and butter cardiology, but there will definitely be some weak spots coming out of training. I'm a firm believer in seeing the most patients, complex cases and broadest range of pathology possible in training when you still have some sort of safety net.
2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=5, created=2024-09-27T21:56:58]: Volume is extremely important. Fortunately (for general cardiology) 95+% of programs have excellent volume. So, I would not worry about it too much. As you imply, for (especially procedural) sub-specialties, there is a lot more variability and case volume becomes a very important metric. As others have mentioned, for general fellowship, exposure to diverse cases (and a strong faculty of attendings) is also very important,portent.
3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=3, created=2024-09-27T13:18:47]: It's more about breadth than volume. But I know applicants, who don't know any better, make a bigger deal about it. In the end most programs can adequately train a competent community general cardiologist. It doesn't take *that* much to do so. I went to a major, high volume program and I can't say I'm necessarily a better cardiologists because of it. Colleagues who trained at "lesser" places are solid too. I wouldn't prioritize volume in my rank list. Someplace like BIDMC is a great program.
4. u/Extra-Return-1029 [score=3, created=2024-09-29T12:12:56]: What other people have said is true, its about exposure, and a lot of cardiology is kind of self thaught tbh, you can’t learn echo, nuclear, diastology etc just by being there, you have to read, watch videos, do questions etc so everything makes sense I would add that you need a functional health system, ie some government run hospitals can be slow but they know how to handle outpatient care really well and if you order X test, it will be done. Whereas in other private/academic systems that doesn’t happens If you can choose a program that is mostly at one hospital is honestly better that rotating in multiple hospitals, learning how a hospital runs is a good % of your job. And last thing: night float is much better that on-call, waking up at 2am to see a consult and going back at 6am to work in the cathlab/do consults/clinic etc is HORRIBLE for your mental and physical health.
5. u/UnhappyWater4285 [score=2, created=2024-09-27T15:21:18]: It depends if your program is mid to high tier with low volume you will still get a good job and there you will learn more and see the volume
6. u/caffeineismysavior [score=2, created=2024-09-28T07:34:56]: I am helping out with the interviews this season for fellowship candidates, and some people have asked about volume. I believe that for general cardiology fellowship, it is important to have a good amount of volume and diversity of pathology as others have mentioned. The other thing to ask is which categories in cardiology have enough volume. Echo, cath, EP? And for cath, are those diagnostic, interventional or structural? For echo, do they get enough stress echos and TEEs? What about nuclear stress tests? During the 3 years of training, the main goal is to have a strong foundation in general cardiology. If you want to sub-specialize into interventional, structural, EP, advanced heart failure etc, then that might be something to consider when you interview. But it is definitely important to ask the program if it is easy or hard to get the numbers for each of the categories I mentioned above. What COCATs level do graduates usually get? For instance, at our program we easily get level 2 for echo and nuclear stress which makes you marketable in the real world if you pass those respective board exams. We don't have the volume to get level 3 echo because we don't have enough structural cases, but we do have a variety like TAVR, MitraClip and Watchmans. We have a lot of cath cases but most fellows are not interested in doing IC or invasive upon graduation - regardless, those who are interested can easily get level 2 numbers.
7. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2024-10-10T20:52:06]: Volume matters but so does prestige of where you train (e.g. Boston hospitals). A lot of this ultimately depends on what your goals are (academics vs non academics) and if you see yourself in a procedural subspecialty (specifically EP or IC).
8. u/DrHouse_42 [score=1, created=2024-10-18T22:16:01]: A question for other ep fellows out there, regarding hands on experience how liberal are your superiors in letting you do procedures assisting vs first operator? How do you feel about the learning curve once you graduate?
