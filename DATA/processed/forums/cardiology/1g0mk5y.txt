===============================================================================

Cardiology applicant here. I’ve been told to go to programs with good cath volumes since I am interested in interventional and have also heard the Boston programs have low Cath volumes. On one of the websites they said they do over 4000 cases a year which is similar to numbers quoted by programs that are said to be high volume. I’m a little confused on how to rank programs based on this conflicting information. Should we be trusting these numbers? Also what is good cath volume?

I trained at a busy southern private place and did +500 LHC +150 RHC and about +100 peripheral in my general. Can’t tell you how many PcI I did as a non IC fellow. Very comfortable with any EP procedure needing a wire or sheath at this point. We use interventional balloons all the time for ablation procedures. I’m very comfortable thanks to my general fellowship.

You can ask each year fellow how many caths they have done. If the interview has passed, ask the program coordinator for the fellows emails. Fellows will know best when it comes to volume.
3. u/br0mer [score=6, created=2024-10-15T14:37:29]: Unless you want to do interventional, it's kinda stupid to care about cath volumes except as a surrogate for overall volume. The curve for learning is definitely U shaped. Too little and too much volume are harmful. Fwiw, I'm a general cardiologist and I'll never cath in my life again.
4. u/cardsguy2018 [score=5, created=2024-10-10T19:56:02]: I would take those advertised numbers with a grain of salt. Who knows where they pulled that number from, what or where it includes, etc. Overall volume is somewhat meaningless anyway. What matters is what fellows actually get to see and do. You should be asking fellows directly about this. Moreover you shouldn't be ranking based on cath volume. What if you change your mind about IC? Many do. Do they have a solid IC fellowship that takes their own? Did you like the program and people? It seems you might be talking about BIDMC, which is a solid program overall and probably one of the busier cath labs in MA. But a robust IC experience is not something boston programs are known for compared to programs elsewhere. Someplace like CCF advertises 10k caths, Mt. Sinai even more.

If you plan to do interventional cardiology after general cardiology fellowship, at least aim for Level 2 numbers per the COCATS 4: [https://www.acc.org/membership/sections-and-councils/fellows-in-training-section/section-updates/2019/10/15/14/42/cocats-boards-and-the-acgme-a-history-of-standards-in-cardiology-fellowship-training](https://www.acc.org/membership/sections-and-councils/fellows-in-training-section/section-updates/2019/10/15/14/42/cocats-boards-and-the-acgme-a-history-of-standards-in-cardiology-fellowship-training) That means 6 months of cath rotation, 300 diagnostics, 100 peripheral cases etc. Level 3 means you have to do interventional cardiology fellowship and pass the ABIM IC boards. One graduate claimed he did 500 cases of diagnostics/PCIs before graduating, which is a lot.
6. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2024-10-11T20:42:12]: Do not trust the numbers stated. They are not necessarily lying, but that doesn’t mean you are not being misled. For instance, some academic programs have community-based practices (outreach, employed or affiliated) where procedures are done at hospitals that the fellows don’t have access to. Other programs might end up double counting or estimating due to lack of clean data (all incentives encourage reporting higher PCI volume). Furthermore, some truly very-high volume centers have so many (accredited and non-accredited) trainees that you don’t do much. For general fellowship: It’s hard to imagine that any hospital out there can’t provide enough diagnostic cath volume to keep you happy. The more important question are: How many caths will the program facilitate you doing as a fellow? Will they let you get some experience with PCI and other procedures as well as a general fellowship? For interventional fellowship, PCI volume (per graduating IC fellow, not per hospital) is very important. As you might imagine, this is a more important decision when you apply to IC fellowship, but your best bet is to talk to second and third year general fellows or IC fellows and ask them about the program.
