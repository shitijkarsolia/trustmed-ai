Fem access with mechanical support and a 7Fr sheath single access. 7Fr EBU 3.5 and a Runthrough down each branch. 3.0 balloon the LAD and see how it behaves. IVUS both branches all pray that the ostial LM isn't significant. When it is indeed significant, balloon the LCx and pray you'll be able to get back in after you stent from the LAD all the way back to the ostium of the LM. LAD wire into the LCx, LCx wire into the LAD. Balloon the stent struts into the LCx and stent back to the LM. Switch wires again. Now kith. POT. Final ivus and pictures. YEET the support. Close. Have a drink.
