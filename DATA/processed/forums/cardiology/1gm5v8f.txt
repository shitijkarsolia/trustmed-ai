===============================================================================

So this is more so to those of you who were debating between fellowships and finally decided. I am currently an intern and like Cardiology. I am about to start doing research and really get into the field. But still, somewhere in the back of my head, I keep thinking that this doesn't seem worth it. Cardiology is 3 extra years, and I am seeing on reddit some insane IM salaries that aren't as good as Cards but also not even close to as much work and obviously 3 less years of grunt work. Lot more call and midnight wake ups than our GI brothers and sisters. Way more hours (?) than PCCM. I guess my fear is that I'll do all this research, put in a bunch of hours, work my ass off during fellowship, and at the end look back and think that I wasted 3 years during which I could have made doctor money and done something else w my life w all the extra time I would have had off. Do any of yall regret going into Cardiology, or those of you who finished and are now attendings, would you say it was worth it, or would you rather have done another specialty/stayed as IM? Partially asking this cuz a family friend of mine who is a Cardiologist even mentioned that he would want his kid to do GI, lot more chill, more money etc. And it kinda threw me off. So wanted to hear the truth of the matter from yall.

You have to quickly figure out the worst part of each job is - that aspect you are going to do over and over and over again and decide if that’s worth it. Like I would not want to talk to people about their poop or abdominal pain for the rest of my life and rather talk about nutrition, exercise, palpitations and heart disease. To each their own.
2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=8, created=2024-11-07T23:26:32]: I absolutely do not regret it. Three years of cardiology fellowship was great. I liked residency well enough, but fellowship is totally different. You are there to acquire skills and research. Everything you do is relevant to your future career. At a good program, you are treated as a junior colleague, not as a scut monkey. You can find ways to make plenty of $$$ in any field if that is your priority. For an employed position in the same market, a cardiologist will typically make more than enough extra to make up for the 3 years of pay loss. In employed positions, cardiology pay is similar to GI (on average). In addition to all of the awesome things about cardiology specifically, I also find a lot of fulfillment in being an expert rather than a generalist. This is not true for all.
3. u/strikex2 [score=6, created=2024-11-07T18:45:43]: Just do what you acutally like... GI, cards, ccm, and hospital medicine are widely differently that picking a specialty based on how your call and reimbursement will look like in 6 years is very misguided. How often you have call, now many calls you get a night, whether you have to come in, what is your yearly imbursement is so widely dependent on what type of practice you join. If you want to make fast doctor money just be a hospitalist in Billings Montana and work your ass off. The group I"m joing has general cardiology weeknight call one night a month and they don't cover STEMIs, which means you're not coming in for anything. A smaller group might have 1 in 5 general call. It's widely variable and that variable will be the same for GI groups. I can't speak for ccm beacuse it's probably all shift work but again, what topics actually interests you?
4. u/cardsguy2018 [score=6, created=2024-11-08T08:37:31]: Well I didn't really debate, I was cardiology all the way. You should choose a specialty that you're actually interested in and are ok with its day to day and the bread and butter. But I think you're not well informed. Money is a lot better in cardiology vs IM. I don't know what "insane" IM salaries you're seeing. Fellowship isn't necessarily terrible. It varies by program. I was at a great program and moonlighted a bunch. Cardiology lifestyle varies tremendously, as it does for every other specialty. My GI friends would laugh at the notion that they have it chill, as would my PCP friends. I have it easier than many of them for sure. I don't work crazy hours, I rarely get woken up at night and never have to go in. A lot of this is job dependent, not necessarily specialty dependent. Some doctors can be awful about giving life/career advice, take it with a grain of salt. I have no regrets, especially after looking at my paycheck and lifestyle. I'm very grateful.
5. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2024-11-09T11:36:39]: I'm five years in to practice as a cardiologist and love it. It's great to be a subspecialist and the science and academic aspects are excellent. I would not overly fixate on compensation/hours etc (they can range widely depending on what you do and where you do it), and you really do need to like what you do if you want a long career.
6. u/docmahi [score=2, created=2024-11-10T17:44:32]: I’m IC - I love it and couldn’t imagine doing anything else Don’t do any fellowship unless you can’t imagine a world where you don’t practice it
7. u/Fit-Addition5324 [score=1, created=2024-11-23T10:33:39]: I would not underestimate the ability to do either interventions or non invasive imaging as a cardiologist - something you cannot do as an internist. In addition to just a ton of RVU's, this also provides a needed break in the monotony of clinic life which in 20 years will be mind numbing to internists. At the end of the day, you need to go into what you like to do, that is the most important piece. But the extra training years for either GI or cardiology will provide you with alot of variation in your ability to practice - like interventions, EP, CT/MRI, nucs, echo - and escape the monotony of primary care.
