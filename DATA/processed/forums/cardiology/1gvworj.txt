===============================================================================

I often see patients with chronic, bilateral, pitting edema in the outpatient setting. If BNP/proBNP and echo are negative for heart failure, can I consider a cardiac cause of the edema to be ruled out? Or is there another cardiac cause to consider? The reason I ask is because I recently talked to a vascular surgeon who said that more often than not the edema I described above usually has a cardiac or renal etiology. Also, if I can't find a clear cause, does it make sense to put these patients on furosemide (if their potassium looks good)?

2. u/piros_pimiento [score=25, created=2024-11-20T19:17:35]: Heart failure is a clinical diagnosis so all the basic things we do outpatient like BNP and echo are just pieces to the puzzle. History would be important (like dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea). BNP can lie, especially in obese patients and the echo can look equivocal (like HFpEF, normal valves, etc). There is an excellent curbsiders podcast episode on your questions, definitely worth a listen. Don’t forget to check meds like CCBs and gabapentin which can cause swelling.

4. u/PNW-heart-dad-5678 [score=10, created=2024-11-20T21:05:10]: I would say one more thing to clarify the point “if echo doesn’t show HF.” I’d say there are specific things on the echo that are absent than it rules out cardiac causes of edema. Ie. If they have 2+ edema and the IVC is small and collapsing it cannot be edema due to HF, no matter what the systolic function or the estimated diastolic function is. In order to have HF edema you have to have high right atrial pressures by definition.
5. u/Angiotensin [score=7, created=2024-11-20T12:16:32]: Yeah, I see a lot of patients started on diuretics for LE edema but as you and a couple other comments said, HF isn’t the only thing that can cause it. If their exam doesn’t show fluid overload and you have a normal BNP it’s definitely enough to exclude heart failure and think about other causes like venous stasis or lymphedema
6. u/ascalapius [score=7, created=2024-11-20T12:40:20]: Ivc exam to assess cvp and assessment of rv . If both normal along with a normal bnp. My assumption is that you have r/o cardiac cause

9. u/LeadTheWayOMI [score=3, created=2024-11-27T07:20:51]: Chronic bilateral pitting edema is commonly caused by systemic issues affecting fluid balance, and evaluating its cause requires a comprehensive assessment. While normal BNP or NT-proBNP levels and echocardiography significantly reduce the likelihood of heart failure, cardiac conditions such as constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, or isolated right ventricular dysfunction may still cause edema and warrant further evaluation with advanced imaging like cardiac MRI or right heart catheterization. Renal causes, including nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema), chronic kidney disease, or acute kidney injury, should be ruled out with appropriate labs such as creatinine and urine protein levels. Hepatic causes, particularly cirrhosis, can lead to peripheral edema due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension, with accompanying features such as ascites or jaundice, which can be evaluated with liver function tests and imaging. Venous insufficiency is another common cause, especially in older adults, presenting with varicosities, leg swelling, and hemosiderin deposits, while early lymphedema may mimic pitting edema, although it is more typically non-pitting in later stages. Endocrine causes, such as hypothyroidism, or nutritional deficiencies causing hypoalbuminemia, should also be considered, particularly when clinical features like fatigue, cold intolerance, or poor dietary intake are present. Idiopathic edema, often seen in premenopausal women, is a diagnosis of exclusion and may not benefit from diuretic therapy. While furosemide can provide symptomatic relief in cases of fluid overload due to heart failure, renal dysfunction, or cirrhosis, it should be used cautiously with close monitoring of potassium levels and renal function and avoided in cases like venous insufficiency or idiopathic edema where the underlying issue is not addressed.
10. u/vy2005 [score=4, created=2024-11-20T11:53:39]: Venous insufficiency and lymphedema are very common. Even in the evaluation of patients with dyspnea, pitting edema doesn’t raise the probability of CHF as an etiology by a large amount
11. u/justhanging14 [score=2, created=2024-11-21T07:15:10]: No you cannot rule out a cardiac cause by just what you described. You need more information. Things that are important here and would point towards HF would be dyspnea, pnd, JVD on exam, markers of diastolic dysfunction on echo, comorbidies that increase the likelihood of HFpEF (htn, diabetes, etc). Dyspnea is a key finding in heart failure patients but if the patient is sedentary this might be tough. You can always do diastolic or exercise stress testing for my information. Excercise lvedp in the cath lab is gold standard for diagnosis of hfpef.
12. u/Mysterious_Job_8251 [score=1, created=2024-11-21T17:20:25]: If someone is obese, a normal bnp isn’t all that useful. In addition, sometimes diastolic function is labeled normal on the echo but in that case, I’d look at mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, dilated LA or dilated RV/RA, elevated PASP etc. like someone else said, exam is important and history, especially the dyspnea piece. You can also ask if their activity level has changed over the last year since a lot of times people will just keep scaling back their activity until they no longer have symptoms. Lymphedema, I would check for a stimmer sign but people can have both lymphedema and heart failure. same with varicose veins. However, if somebody has deep vein insufficiency, especially if it is pulsatile I will almost always get an echo. There’s also the H2PEF score which sometimes can be helpful and is decently validated.
