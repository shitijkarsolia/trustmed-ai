Hello everyone! I’ve recently joined this community and I’m seeking advice or guidance from any sonographers who may have or have known someone who has ADHD. I’ve been diagnosed from a very young age but has been unmedicated for many years now, I’ve always wanted to do something with the cardiovascular system and I’ve come down to either CVT or Sonography, though I am worried that having it will make it much more difficult in the field. If you have any advice or know someone who has it as either career paths and are doing okay I would love to know what you did to help you through. I want to ensure I make the best decision for myself!

2. u/ad2929 [score=1, created=2024-11-27T11:41:04]: I also have ADHD and hospitals are full of us! Where I work (UK) cardiac physiologists are the 'jack of all trades' of cardiac diagnostics, we start out doing ECGs, Holters, BP monitors and exercise stress tests, and then upskill to cath lab monitoring, pacemaker/ICD programming, echocardiography, and/or EP studies depending on individual skills and interests. My personal preference leans towards cath lab, EP and pacemaker/ICD implants and programming. But that's just me - I like how dynamic and fast paced the cath lab can be and buzz off working closely with the team - though many of my colleagues don't like or avoid it due to the more stressful nature of some of the cases. I also like complex pacing and EP cause it just clicks for me. Because I enjoy what I'm doing it's easy to get a focus going. And there's so much going on that I don't get bored. I personally avoid both stress tests and echo, mainly cause I don't enjoy talking to the same patient for 30-40 mins, so YMMV depending on your tolerance for peopling - in the dark of an echo room patients can get real chatty! The most important thing is just finding a department where you get on with your colleagues IMHO; cause that will make or break your enjoyment of the job. TL;DR - hospital are full of people with ADHD and all else. As cardiac physiologist with ADHD, I prefer cath lab and pacing over echo as peopling tires me out and I buzz off adrenaline, but if you have a dept that you vibe with it's a great career!
