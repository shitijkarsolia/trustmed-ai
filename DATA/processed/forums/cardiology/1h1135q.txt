===============================================================================

I’m a USMD M4 set on cardiology who is currently applying to IM programs and very fortunate to have a strong list of interviews. My top two choices right now are Yale and University of Michigan, since they’re in desirable locations for me, have strong fellowship match lists, strong in-house cardiology fellowships, and will take their own for fellowship. It’s difficult for me to separate them right now. I know it’s ultimately splitting hairs and I would love to attend either program, but I don’t get to rank both #1. Which would you choose and why? Any insight into strengths/weaknesses or other considerations for their respective cardiology fellowships? [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1h1135q)

Everyone I know who went there for either were happy with their experience. All I know about Yale is from my fellowship interview day. I ranked their cards program last. YMMV. "Branding" is just nonsense.
2. u/TheWizardPenguin [score=4, created=2024-11-27T12:57:07]: I did my training in New Haven but interviewed at both. You really can't go wrong with either. You will be plenty well trained and set up for matching into cardiology from both places. I would say Yale has a slightly better "branding" but that's mostly from undergrad and matters more to patients than your colleagues. Ann Arbor &gt;&gt; New Haven though.

4. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2024-11-28T22:33:02]: Either one will set you up well. I would rank #1 based on geography/support system and your gut feeling based on interview day
5. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=-3, created=2024-11-28T01:20:20]: This is a ridiculous post. We get it, you did well. Input from here is not going to help. Wrong sub. Maybe just try SDN.
