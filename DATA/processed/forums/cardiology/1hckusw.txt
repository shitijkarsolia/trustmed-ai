===============================================================================

I am a current 2nd-year fellow planning to applying to IC this coming cycle. I know that IC adopted a formal match this year and was hoping to hear from people who have just gone through it? How many interviews do you think one needs to safely match? Is it possible to match outside of your home program? Thanks!

3. u/rahul0774 [score=3, created=2024-12-12T07:21:42]: Thanks a lot. Do you mind if I ask more specific questions about the process? Happy to DM you, if you prefer?
