===============================================================================

I’ve been trying to understand how conclusions can be so straightforwardly drawn from significant composite endpoints when individual constituents of these endpoints fail to meet statistical significance. I’ve noticed a few randomized control trials in cardiology that have buttressed clinical conclusions solely from composite endpoints that may have met statistical significance yet, when broken down by components that have defined the composite endpoint, statistical significance is no longer apparent. I know these composite endpoints are a strategy to lower sample sizes and increase event rates, but should we be more tempered in our interpretation in these instances? A reliance on composite endpoints seems to represent a relatively handy way of performing these RCTs. However, how statistically valid is it to be inflating these composite endpoints with individual endpoints that really do not pertain to the question at hand? Appreciate your thoughts.

1. u/nalsnals [score=17, created=2024-12-13T16:38:29]: The idea of composite endpoints is fair enough as many therapies will take many years to demonstrate a mortality benefit. The problem is when that is exploited by drug/device companies and NEJM-hungry investigators to rig trials for a positive outcome with weak composite endpoints. For example, incorporating subjective symptom scores in an unblinded trial of Triclip is completely rigging the endpoint, so they can call a device that doesn't reduce HF hospitalisation a success. Also, there is an increasing trend of incorporating surrogate endpoints that don't necessarily predict meaningful outcomes. MI, hospitalisation and and EF all will predict hard endpoints. 6 seconds of AF on an ILR or non-MI revasc does not in my opinion.
2. u/noltey22 [score=23, created=2024-12-13T13:30:44]: The problem nowadays is that our medical therapy is so good. That event rates are so low. Couple that with the insane cost of performing one of these large scale clinical trials and they’re gonna continue to use composite points to try to gain any type of significance
3. u/Greenheartdoc29 [score=11, created=2024-12-13T14:21:46]: Yes it’s a matter of money and also time to reach a positive result. But it’s also acknowledging that a body count isn’t the only bad outcome.
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2024-12-14T01:57:48]: It depends on the composite and how it is being used. The justifiable reason to use a composite endpoint is to achieve an appropriately powered study in a reasonable amount of time with a smaller number of subjects. However, composite endpoints are increasingly abused for the usual reasons. For a composite endpoint to be appropriate, the items in the composite need to be somewhat similar in (1) biological mechanism, (2) severity and (3) objectivity. For instance, it may be appropriate to use the original 3-point "major adverse cardiac event" (MACE) composite endpoint of MI, CVA and CV death. Broadly speaking, these are similar in that (1) they are mostly presumed to be caused by a vascular etiology, (2) they are all life-threatening and (3) they are all verifiable by established criteria. When the endpoints are dissimilar, it is extremely challenging to interpret the results and use them clinically. For example, in FAME the composite endpoint was death, MI and revascularization. The (1) biological mechanism leading to these might be similar. However, (2) revasculaization is not as severe/life-threatening as MI/death and (3) revascularization is often done with highly subjective criteria (not similar to objectivity of death or MI). I would consider this a borderline case.
5. u/crazedeagle [score=3, created=2024-12-13T15:01:14]: It’s reasonable for capturing “badness” without crazy high n to measure each individual, rarer endpoint as long as they’re related. In a similar vein composite primaries are also kind of a workaround to splitting alpha for what would otherwise be co-primaries which makes it practical but a little more statistically dubious
6. u/Feynization [score=2, created=2024-12-13T13:34:13]: I’m curious to know more, but I always interpreted these endpoints as “\[least bad endpoint\] or worse...” So death + MACE + hospitalisation isn’t actually trying to capture much data on death or MACE, but rather trying to capture information on hospitalisation rates without being biased to exclude people who went into VT on the couch at home.
7. u/BlueMoonRising89 [score=1, created=2024-12-15T15:58:54]: Some companies take it to the extreme. If I see another TAVR vs. SAVR trial with 'rehospitalization' included in the composite primary endpoint I'm going to lose my mind.
