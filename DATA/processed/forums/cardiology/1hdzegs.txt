===============================================================================

I have been a big fan of John Mandrola's "This Week in Cardiology" podcast for a long time. I really appreciated his critical appraisal of cardiology studies, his "medical conservatism" and his willingness to challenge the KOLs and other loud voices in medicine. However, he seems to be becoming more of a nihilist, a luddite and a hypocrite. I applaud medical conservatism and placing the onus of proof on those pushing new therapies, but one of the reasons that I got into cardiology is because it is an area in medicine where advances in technology has made real, meaningful differences in the lives of our patients. How can you not look at the history of Andreas Grüntzig and others' contributions to cardiology and not be proud and excited about the audacity and ingenuity of their work? We want new technologies and we want to use them to make a difference for our patients. His latest take is that he is basically endorsing lower reimbursement for cardiologists because, well, I don't know why. Maybe because he already "got his" and is counting down towards retirement instead of trying to make it in a world where every aspect of practicing cardiology (form the patient relationships, to the pay, to the autonomy) is posing increasingly difficult challenges. Maybe it is because his focus is on flying around the world speaking instead of taking care of those patients that anchor the rest of us down to one location the majority of the time. Whatever it is, it seems tone deaf. Have I become too critical? Anyone have any good podcast recommendations that focus on EBM or critical appraisal for cardiologists?

2. u/vihreakuutio [score=30, created=2024-12-14T09:06:11]: Don't really agree. Been listening for a few years and still enjoy the podcast. Certainly don't agree with everything (e.g. critique for GLP analogs, hard skepticism for all new technology, often oversimplifying complex topics etc.) but honestly much of his critique is pretty fair. Also think increasing the interest for evidence based medicine in general is a good thing as much of the evidence we base our clinical decisions on is weak and questioning it difficult. Also listened to the latest episode but don't remember him supporting lower reimbursement for cardiologists - he literary stated that paying less for seeing patients "seems dumb", but also critiqued paying more for reading CTA's while suggesting financially incentivising practicing evidence based medicine. I try to at least briefly stay up to date with the largest journals in the field and he only covers a pretty small part of all the new trials which is problematic/end up getting too much focus so definitely can't only rely on his podcast to stay up to date. Recommendations for other podcasts: CardioNerds, Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular CME, The Lead Podcast, MedMastery Cardiology Digest, CRTOnline Podcast, NEJM This Week, HeartCorner: Innovations in Cardiovascular Science (and of course CardioNerds)
3. u/chummybears [score=16, created=2024-12-14T04:07:45]: I completely agree. I used to listen to his podcast weekly but stopped around a year ago or two ago for similar reasons. His takes are getting increasingly hypocritical. He would pop up on my Twitter feed ever once and a while and make me roll my eyes. I haven't seen his latest take at we should be reimbursed less can't wait to be angered by that. I don't have any recommendations for other podcasts I used to love his summaries of the national conferences, I haven't found a replacement.
4. u/Creepysarcasticgeek [score=13, created=2024-12-14T05:04:58]: Completely agree with this. I learned a lot from him and I have a lot of (what I consider healthy) skepticism in medicine partially thanks to him. That being said I do find his takes hypocritical, he latches on anything that confirms his previous biases and strongly opposes anything that doesn’t. That being said, he’s telling us what he thinks, and his prerogative to have his opinion in his podcast. I just got tired listening to him
5. u/AssUpSatsUp [score=8, created=2024-12-14T07:12:30]: I guess I just never really saw the appeal to begin with. I'm aware that this makes me an outlier but to me he's always come across as distasteful in ways that I can't put my finger on.
6. u/Significant_Bit_1683 [score=5, created=2024-12-14T13:49:17]: Been listening for 2-3 years now and I still look forward to the podcast every Friday. I think he does a wonderful job keeping up with the literature and presents his own critical analysis in a way which forces the listener to think. It is extremely valuable to have someone actually talking about critical appraisal instead of most other podcasts or medical news articles which give endless praise to every publication, regardless of flaws or limitations. Other podcasts: Eagle’s Eye View, ACCEL lite, ACC CardiaCast I clearly am an ACC fan
7. u/jiklkfd578 [score=7, created=2024-12-14T08:27:26]: There’s no one I eye roll more in the professional setting than John Mandrola. He’s just a grifter/infiuencer and that’s his brand and that’s how he gets paid.. Rita Redberg 2.0 in the modern era.
8. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2024-12-14T06:27:28]: Can someone please suggest a replacement? I just found out about this podcast and now everyone is telling me it’s going down hill. Any substitute recommendations would be great.
9. u/FlimsyPope [score=3, created=2025-01-25T06:56:26]: I have been a religious listener to his podcast since 2018 or 19. His critique of studies makes one appreciate the fact that cardiology is a business for drug makers and device vendors. His podcast now seems to be more more focused on EP and less on general cardiology. he now seems to always go back to procedures and devices that He does not agree with. this is becoming somewhat an old diatribe. Kim eagle’s eye I think is good as long as Deepak Bhatt is not hosting. Bhatt seems to very cozy with industry
10. u/Grandbrother [score=2, created=2024-12-14T10:57:27]: No you have not become too critical. He makes good points occasionally but they are all buried underneath the nihilist schtick. He just wants attention at this point.
11. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2024-12-15T13:30:18]: I still think JM is a fresh of breath air. But he’s also created a bit of a nihilistic voice for himself that he’s capitalized on in terms of travel/giving talks. That being said, I appreciate his nuances takes on trials— most clinicians don’t think through the science the way they should
12. u/jsaf237 [score=1, created=2024-12-15T10:24:21]: I lm surprised that this many people listen
13. u/motorwayman [score=0, created=2024-12-17T17:36:52]: Done with them I never even heard of them. What are you talking about?
