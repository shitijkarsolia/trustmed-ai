Hello everyone, I’m a Senior Registrar Cardiologist with completed training in general cardiovascular medicine and a fellowship from the Egyptian Board of Cardiovascular Medicine. My primary interest lies in Heart Failure and Advanced Heart Failure, and I’m keen to pursue further training in this subspecialty. Here’s my current situation: I am not ECFMG certified (have not taken the USMLE). I’m open to training opportunities in non-accredited programs or observerships, especially in English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, or others. My focus is on gaining advanced clinical and practical exposure in heart failure management, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplant care. I’d greatly appreciate your advice on the following: 1. Are there specific programs, hospitals, or institutions known for accepting international physicians for training in heart failure? 2. What are some alternative routes for gaining advanced exposure without ECFMG certification? 3. Any personal experiences, resources, or forums that could help me navigate this path? Thank you in advance for any suggestions or guidance you can provide!

The program is very competitive though and needs to apply 1.5 to 2 years ahead of start. Also, busy schedule, lots of calls.
