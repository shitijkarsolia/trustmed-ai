Hi everyone, I am a resident applying for Cardiology Fellowship next year. I have been working on various research projects like case reports, literature reviews and meta-analysis, but many get rejected upon submission, likely due to areas needing improvement. I’m seeking a Cardiology Attending or a Fellow to review my projects and provide guidance before submission. Please DM me if interested. I would greatly appreciate their help. Thank you!
