I am considering a career in echocardiography or neurophysiology. As an echocardiologist would you recommend the career and what are the pros and cons? Is it a tough job which turns tiring in the long run?

You are essentially doing 10-12 scans a day, a revolving door, however I enjoy it. Physically you can have back/shoulder pains if you don’t be careful while scanning - try and find a centre that will allow you to scan left handed as I’m pretty sure in the long run it’s better for your body. Also doesn’t help that the general public are getting bigger and bigger so some scans really strain your arm. It’s a nice mix of practical skills/theory with the image acquisition &amp; reporting side of things. I’m purely an echocardiographer, but if you start out in cardiac physiology your job may be more varied - ecgs, holter, exercise tests etc. Any questions lmk
2. u/koalafart [score=8, created=2024-12-26T05:39:47]: It's not very difficult. I always feel like hand eye coordination helps. Patient population is getting larger, which makes the job a bit tricky. We get repetitive stress injuries, like any job. Jobs can vary greatly from clinic to level one trauma hospital.
3. u/Few-Particular1780 [score=5, created=2024-12-26T14:39:26]: So believe it or not I'm in the position where I've done both Neurophysiology (EEG, Nerve studies, EMG) and Echocardiography for atleast 1 year+ Pros Neurophysiology- - little job related body pains - Easier tests with less brain work (Unless you decide to do a masters then the brain work is insane) - Straight forward reporting Cons Neurophysiology - tests on paediatric or neudivergent patients are pretty tough and might leave you frustrated 😩 - Extremely boring and repetitive even worse than scans (my personal opinion) - Texts are hard to get into (Again my personal opinion) Pros Echocardiography /Cardiac Physiology - Same scans but interesting tests - Big field with ECG, Holters, Echos, Pacemakers, Stress tests. So you could get into anything. (Try to find a center that does both ECHOs and Rhythm to broaden your options) - Little discussion with patients - Interestimg texts, reading might even be fun. Cons Echocardiography / Cardiac Physiology - Big patients -Stressful and hard on your body. Can lead to life long injuries - Maybe boring after a while - Paediatrics and neonatal babies can be tough -Mistakes…

Practice varies widely across the world, typically in North America there are techs that do the studies and the cardiologists interprets them and generates the report. While other places the echocardiographer might be the one obtaining the images. Just like everything, there are occupational hazards mainly the ergonomics of scanning can lead to musculoskeletal discomfort and injuries.

6. u/BadonkaDonkies [score=2, created=2024-12-26T08:16:37]: Echo technologist is a great career choice. There's always echos that need to be performed so will have good job prospects.
7. u/Allarya [score=2, created=2024-12-27T02:34:43]: Hi, I'm a cardiac physiologist who has specialised in echocardiography and thus, my job has been essentially echocardiography for the past 5 years. Overall I do like it, it is an interesting skill that will have you learn a lot about cardiac anatomy, physiology and different pathophysiology. I also find making associations of this knowledge with the imaging and the quantitative data, very satisfying and engaging. On the other hand, depending on where you work, after a while you might find yourself bored, because you end up seeing the same pathology again and again...and again. This, I guess, is common for every job but here I find it particularly repetitive and tedious because you will be doing exactly the same views and same measurements every time and write almost the same text on your report. You will still find very interesting cases that will make you use your brain, discuss hypothesis with your colleagues, do things a bit outside of the ordinary, but those occasions will probably become less and less frequent. When I got to this point, I have since transitioned to paediatrics and congenital heart disease and so far I'm enjoying it a lot and it kind of re-ignited the passion for what I do (at least for now). Another thing to consider is, as a lot of other redditors already mentioned, your physical wellbeing. This job puts a lot of stress on your shoulders and back and can lead to repetitive strain injury. If you do pursue this career I suggest you learn to scan left handed and keep a healthy lifestyle by strengthening your back muscles and (try to) keep a good posture during your scans. As a life sustaining career, the demand for echocardiography is only getting higher and higher. It is a non-invasive test, relatively cheap, safe and provides a lot of information so there's no surprise there, you won't struggle to find a job and you can even make good money if you're willing to work a few extra hours (this might vary country to country though). Within echocardiography there's also a few doors that can open to develop your career and get some of that job satisfaction such as transoesophageal (TOE/TEE), 3D, stress echocardiography, congenital heart disease. A lot of us are also widely sought by the industry to work as reps and application specialists so that is also another door that might open for you. Hope this helps. Best of luck

I've been doing echos since 2004 😱 It's THE MOST REWARDING PART OF MY JOB. I disagree with the person who said it's a revolving doors. There's always something new to see. I do like 50 echos a week and 3 TEEs on average. After 21 years of practice, I still get to see something new every week.

10. u/Cautious-Map-9568 [score=1, created=2025-01-01T22:17:01]: choose Cardiac Physiology please! you wont regret it.
11. u/ejpusa [score=-17, created=2024-12-26T08:13:22]: GPT-4o was 100X more informative about my EKG then my Cardiologist. Not sure why the Cardiologist was even needed. He was blown away, and that’s an understatement. It’s all pattern recognition. And AI loves looking for those patterns. His bill was $900. GPT-4o is $20 a month. It’s interesting in the the world of Medicine. AI will take over as much as it can. It works.
