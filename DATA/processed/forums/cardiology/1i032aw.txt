Not sure if this is the right sub, but I saw this note while working my way through Podrid’s Real-World ECGs: Volume 1. This seems very counterintuitive and I can’t find any evidence to back this up. Am I missing something here? Full excerpt: “It should be noted that ischemia is not the cause of sinus node abnormalities. The sinus and AV nodes generate an action potential that is based on calcium ion fluxes, which are energy independent and do not require an energy-dependent ATPase pump. Hence sinus and AV nodal activity is unaffected by ischemia”

Pacemaker cells also lack sarcomeres and therefore do not undergo the heavily ATP-involved process of sarcomere contraction like myocytes do. What else is left for this cell type to consume ATP with? The Cell cycle or any repair? These are highly specialized neurons that remain in G0, and neurons can take up to 80 years to undergo just one cycle. As such, they have their own 'energy profile' so to speak" Contrast with cardiac myocytes, which are some of the most metabolically active cells in the entire body (the coronary sinus has the lowest O2 concentration of any vessel in the body). A completely different cell line, that actually has sarcomeres, that relies heavily on ATP. This ultimately means that pacemaker cells can go longer in ischemia vs myocytes, and that for pacemaker cells to become dysfunctional, its gotta be from another pathology (i.e an electrical feedback mechanism). This explains how the Bundle of Kent causes WPW, and how AVNRT's work. It doesn't mean that nodes can't be ischemic, but that they last longer in ischemia vs myocytes. So then, how do MI's cause arrhythmias? Any type of myocyte necrosis will cause leakage of electrolytes in specified patterns. * ↓ O2 reaches to mitochondria → ↓ ATP production * ↓ or Absent ATP → many transport channels in a cell stop working (particularly Na/K ATPases) * ↓ Na/K ATPase activity → ↑ intracellular H2O Retention * ↑↑ H20 Retention → Blebbing, karyorrhexis, and all that jazz → Cell Lysis * Cell Lysis → Spilling of electrolytic content into interstitium * Electrolytes in interstitium → change in nearby cell membrane voltage → EKG Changes Both endocardial and transmural necrosis will cause an aberrant source of depolarization that will usually propagate backwards to the pacemaker nodes. Once propagated, we have alterations to the membrane voltage, and opening of channels outside of SA node firing. * Ischemia → myocyte necrosis * myocyte necrosis → source of aberrant electrical activity (AEA) * AEA → backwards propagation → Feedback/summation with pacemaker * Feedback / summation → Arrythmia It's not the ischemia of the pacemaker that's causing the arrythmia. But of course there are always exceptions. I hope this helps

3. u/[deleted] [score=4, created=2025-01-12T19:08:21]: Interesting However, it is not uncommon to see CHB with inferior STEMI. How would that be explained?
4. u/astrofuzzics [score=3, created=2025-01-12T19:38:05]: Calcium doesn’t require an ATPase pump? News to me, isn’t that what SERCA2 is?
5. u/ceelo71 [score=3, created=2025-01-12T22:56:33]: Anecdotal story: Patient came in with STEMI, emergent PCI performed, SA nodal artery was jailed. Placed a pacemaker about five days later as he had sinus arrest with junctional rhythm after.
6. u/PNW-heart-dad-5678 [score=1, created=2025-01-12T21:28:59]: Maybe they mean chronic ischemia as opposed to acute ischemia/infarction?
7. u/pshaffer [score=1, created=2025-01-13T05:37:42]: as with anything, there are exceptions. One patient we had had a RCA lesion affecting the artery to the AV node - when he exercised he went into complete heart block. Only one I ever saw, so it was rare, but if the question is "does it happen", the answer is yes.
8. u/phoenixonstandby [score=1, created=2025-01-14T23:15:34]: Does not make sense in my limited knowledge. Someone please correct me if the below does not work out: The resting membrane potential of a cardiomyocyte is predominantly determined by the Na-K ATPase pump. As resting membrane potential starts to rise in the setting of ischemia, less sodium channels are available for the sharp depolarization upstroke. As a result, both conduction and excitation-contraction coupling (calcium induced calcium release) are dampened until they cease. Funny channel sodium current drives the pacemaking automaticity, however, if the cell is not able to repolarize sufficiently via the Na-K ATPase, Na channels will remain closed and no action potential will be able to propagate as the resting membrane potential continues to depolarize/equilibrate to zero millivolts.
