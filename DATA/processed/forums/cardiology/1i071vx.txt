Hey Everyone, I am a graduate of one Canadians medical schools and currently PGY2 in IM at a Canadian Royal College certified program. For my cardiology fellowship I am planning to move down south to the states since I just obtained my Green Card. Many states with Accept the LMCC (licensure of medical council of Canada) examinations in lieu of USMLE exams. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I have challenged and passed all my Canadian exams but have not attempted the steps. How are my chances? For reference I have ~60 pubs ~30 abstract presentations at AHA/ACC/HRS, was involved in cardiology since before med school, will have very good recoms from staff and PD, all electives done in cardiology, ++ leadership and teaching experience during residency. I would really appreciate any thoughts and suggestions.
