Posting here to get some idea about interventional cardiology jobs in the northeast. Ideally looking for complex PCI coming out of training with some mentorship available. Leaning more towards academic for these reasons. Anybody have any leads?? Thanks and appreciate it in advance

Check out [www.mystethi.com](http://www.mystethi.com) Filter by all jobs - find the hospitals in the region and E-mail the hospital recruiters. Many, many jobs just aren't advertised unless you go to the actual hospital site.
