I've heard conflicting things about which one is better to buy to prepare for cardiology boards. anyone have experience or strong opinions on the difference between them?

There's also a lot of mistakes and borderline ekgs. Multiple ekgs were HR right at 55-60 and would inconsistently be coded as sinus Brady or sinus rhythm, which is 4 points. LAE would be coded or not and it was random. At least ecgsource hits the highlights. I'd stick to ecgsource as undercoding is probably better than overcoding.

3. u/docamok81 [score=3, created=2025-01-16T22:51:48]: I used both. Used Okeefe’s online ECG bank (accessed via the Mayo course) for coding practice - felt their coding answers was more consistent and helpful for the test. ECG source has too many ECGs and oftentimes their coding is inconsistent. They do have a subsection on high yield ECGs which was actually very helpful to review the day prior. I did watch the coding videos from Mayo lectures as well and got good insight on what the examiners are looking for and such. Wish you the best.
