Hi! Curious GP here (not in training yet). I recently encountered a case of a STEMI patient who underwent thrombolysis. The resident in charge (RIC) put the patient on NPO, so I asked why. He said it was to prevent GI bleeding. I tried looking for solid evidence online to support this but couldn’t find any. So is it really necessary for post-thrombolysis STEMI patients to be on NPO? The only rationale I found was if the patient is pending CABG or PCI in case thrombolysis fails. Would love to hear your thoughts on this! P.s. Thank you to the mods for allowing me to inquire on this sub
