===============================================================================

Hey everyone just wanted to rant. I am currently doing interventional cardiology fellowship and work insane hours in the lab. Fellowship is very busy. I feel burnt out. I decided to take the boards inspite barely getting any time to study. I did well on day 1 even with minimal studying. Day 2 since I didn't prep much was ultra conservative in coding. ECGs and angiograms I was within passing SD but echoes I scored really low and ultimately failed. I did ecg source as much as i could. I never did O Keefe. Just started doing them but man they make me feel like I coded very little in the exam. I was shattered. I have never failed a test in my life and was top of my med school and did well in all my ITEs. What hurt the most is I cleared echo boards with relative ease. Imposter syndrome is at an all time high. I'm starting my job in 6 months. In the grand scheme of things it might be small but still every day I get this feeling that I messed up.

2. u/[deleted] [score=11, created=2025-01-29T11:06:29]: If it makes you feel any better… it’s not uncommon and I heard after people learn to game the coding they pass the next year and nobody gives a fuck after
3. u/chummybears [score=9, created=2025-01-29T11:11:27]: I passed STEP 1 by a few points. Lucky enough to matched and now I'm attending interventional cardiologist and passed all boards. Yes it's going to shake your confidence but use it as motivation. Don't let it define you. Everyone has imposter syndrome. I have it daily. Be thorough and keep working. You don't get into interventional fellowship by luck, you've worked hard to get there and you deserve to be there. Don't worry. The imaging sections on boards suckkkkk. The pictures suck and there's limited views. Echo boards are way harder. The questions are shit. Just remember DON'T OVER CODE. I never put LVH, left atrial enlargement, or right atrial enlargement on EKGs. Not worth the risk of negative points by coding it. Only code the obvious things on your answers and that applies for all the ekg/imaging where you pick the answers from the list of answers. Good luck, you'll be fine! Enjoy interventional fellowship, you're not going to have another time where you're in the lab so much.
4. u/DisposableServant [score=8, created=2025-01-29T12:23:27]: I think okeefe tends to promote overcoding but that’s not necessarily a good thing. I limited to a max of ~3-4 codes per case for everything day 2 and scored 2SD above average. ECGsource is a much more accurate reflection of the cases than okeefe IMO
5. u/shahtavacko [score=6, created=2025-01-29T14:13:11]: I went into medicine after being a chemical engineer and I always say the EIT exam (test you took before applying to become a professional engineer) was the hardest test I ever came across with the exception of the first cardiology boards (which I now have repeated twice over the past twenty years); I believe I passed by the skin of my teeth, but that was the one test that almost kicked my rear end. You’ll be fine, not passing isn’t uncommon by any means.
6. u/jiklkfd578 [score=4, created=2025-01-29T11:35:38]: Think of what we go through with a decade plus of intense education, training with work standards and conditions unmatched in the professional world. After all of that we aren’t made big law or PE partners but instead have to take some test with arbitrary testing and scoring where a significant portion will fail.. making them feel like a failure and allowing others (admin) to stigmatize them despite everything they’ve accomplished to date.
7. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2025-01-29T23:25:00]: That second day of the boards is the worst designed test I have ever taken. It doesn’t really test knowledge, it tests whether or not it you have practiced how to pass that specific exam. Some of the questions ask you to make inappropriate conclusions from limited information (we always want multiple views in echo and angiography, right?). It’s the worst game of “guess what I’m thinking” that I have seen on a standardized test. Echo boards test a much deeper understanding of and ability to interpret echos. That test is tough, but fair. Don’t let it get to you. Get the most out of interventional year. Know in the future that you have to play the game and specifically study how to pass that specific test.
8. u/FLCardio [score=3, created=2025-01-29T16:38:02]: Don’t stress about it. Know plenty who failed first time. Honestly I thought the echo boards were the hardest test I’ve taken in my life and you passed that and recognized you didn’t prepared for cards boards. Ultimately you’ll take it again, pass and this will be a distant memory. No harm done. You got this.
9. u/jgarmd33 [score=3, created=2025-01-29T16:39:49]: It happens much more than you think. Just crush it next test and be dive with it. It will not be the reason you don’t get a job or position.
10. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2025-01-29T21:18:36]: It's not a great exam and a lot of good clinicians don't pass it. At my last institution (I was a HF fellowship PD), 2/6 general fellows did not pass last year. It was for the same reason.
11. u/wunsoo [score=1, created=2025-02-05T12:11:54]: Very common for IC fellows to not do well on the second day. Hopefully we will have our own certifying board soon and we can break with the ancient dinosaurs who write the current test. Also - just wait till you see the horrible angios on the IC boards
