Results are out. You can find them on the APCA website and look under My CBCCT/CBCMR/CBNC Certifications. I did about 1 month of prep and did ASNC videos x2 with their questions and Jaber questions x2. I did not read any of the guideline documents. I did not watch the 80 hour course videos.

1. u/bourlag1 [score=5, created=2025-03-04T06:15:01]: 3-4 weeks of prep, didnt crush it but didnt skate by either. ASNC vids and associated questions, jaber, and board vitals all x2. Found jaber mildly low yield
2. u/chummybears [score=3, created=2025-03-04T06:35:39]: How do you not watch the God forsaken 80 hour course??!!!?!??!! That was the worse thing in. My academic career. I hated that course
3. u/Aggravating_Leg_2069 [score=3, created=2025-07-08T21:41:08]: Are the ASNC videos the Core Curriculum videos and associated questions or did you purchase the board prep video course from ASNC?
4. u/wannaberesident [score=2, created=2025-03-04T21:55:40]: ~3 weeks of partial study. Did ASNC videos x1.5, only able to finish a couple chapters of Jaber. Too broke to pay for Board Vitals. Passed comfortably, ~640/700. That being said, I very much disagree with you study for 2 days and pass concept. This exam is not that easy.
