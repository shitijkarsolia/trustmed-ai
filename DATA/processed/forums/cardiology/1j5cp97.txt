===============================================================================

Greetings everyone. I am looking for some feedback from those who know more about hearts than I do. I am a Paramedic and working on increasing my abilities in cardiac related areas, something I will admit is not my strong suit. Today, a discussion came up between me and a couple others relating to ACS/STEMI type cases and the utilization of Nitroglycerin infusions to reduce cardiac ischemia/infarct. The discussion progressed to talking about options if pressure begins dropping below our comfort level and the direction to head (titrating the nitro infusion lower/discontinuing it, or working to raise the blood pressure in other ways). This led us down the path of a double infusion, one for Norepi as a pressor to increase blood flow back to the heart, the other being a Nitro infusion to maintain vasodilation. I have seen this done before, however, I do not think it is common. My own research points to the Coronary Arterioles actually further dilating from Norepi due to a lack of Alpha 1 receptors and receiving Beta receptor stimulation, however the larger coronary arteries have a significant amount of Alpha 1 receptors and I would think they would vasoconstrict, increasing ischemia. Alternatively, Nitro works utilizing cGMP to produce vasodilation and does not rely on the Alpha/Beta system to produce results. In addition, Norepi still creates an increased cardiac workload, although not to the extent of epinephrine. Would this unwanted effect cause more harm than good if there is increased vasodilation feeding the heart? Essentially I am picturing Vasodilation occurring near/around the heart with vasoconstriction occurring in the periphery shunting more blood to the heart, increasing Oxygenation. My thought process is to just decrease the nitro infusion if I run into an issue with pressure, however if this pressor/nitro combo can be beneficial, it may make for great discussion and improve some patient outcomes down the line. Please let me know your thoughts, I am quite interested in this topic now and ready to learn whatever I can! Thanks in advance!

A sublingual nitro tablet is around 400mcg whereas the nitro drip can be titrated by 10mcg. Sometimes people dont need much to feel better. Norepi just for the sake of uptitrating nitro is not a favored strategy. As you mentioned, all the beta stimulation in particular increases myocardial oxygen demand. In the setting of ACS this is promoting more ischemia and can lower your threshold for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. If youre on a nitro drip and the blood pressures dropping I would 100% favor backing off on the nitro before adding norepi for this reason. The selectivity youre proposing is sound from a theoretical standpoint, but in clinical practice I dont think it would be a sound strategy - particularly when considering arrhythmic potential. Happy to answer more/clarify as needed

Nitrates don’t improve outcomes in STEMI. I wouldn’t say it reduces the infarct more peri infarct / ischemic pain. Hypotension in MI and needing pressor support is not a great prognostic sign but if you’re there for sure jettison the nitrates. I am not an expert on medicine in the field and if nitro drips are commonly started (I didn’t think so), but my threshold to start a med that is is hemodynamically active and offers no benefit would be through the roof.
3. u/PS2020 [score=5, created=2025-03-06T19:48:30]: Nitrates reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload. The heart has to work less, there is less oxygen delivery mismatch, therefore decreased angina. If my patient gets hypotensive from Nitro, I titrate it down/off, rather than reaching for norepi/epi. Pressors will increase afterload on the heart + chronotropy, increasing myocardial oxygen demand, resulting in more angina. You are pushing and pulling at the same time in that case which doesn't make much sense. Bradycardia may be one example where I'd consider using both under certain circumstances.
4. u/peeam [score=2, created=2025-03-06T21:55:35]: The key thing for nitrate infusion is keeping the dose low to avoid hypotension and development of nitrate tolerance.
5. u/hoyaMD [score=2, created=2025-03-07T20:26:59]: If patient is needing so much nitro they’re hypotensive then it’s more of a sign they need to get to the cath lab ASAP if they’re not chest pain free.
6. u/nalsnals [score=1, created=2025-03-07T21:30:08]: You may be overcomplicating things a bit. Understanding physiology isninportant, but at the end of the day, it's the big ticket items that influence meaningful outcomes. As far as I know, there is no evidence that GTN reduces infarct size in any meaningful way. It can make the patient feel better and can make the practitioner feel better, but that's about it. Support BP with vasopressors if shocked, but otherwise, the only way to improve meaningful outcomes is always going to be opening the artery as soon as possible with tPA or PCI, depending on your location.
