===============================================================================

I want to complete a Masters in Echocardiography however, upon some research and advice I hear that you can get injured and about 90% of sonographers have MSK injuries. This is kind of putting me off as I have been dealing with sports related injuries for a while now and wouldn’t want to get injured even more. Would love some advice! Thanks!

I exercise a lot though, so I'd assume that has something of an impact. I look at it like all manual handling; if you take shortcuts, you'll increase your risk of injury, but it's more than possible to avoid injury even with a high volume of studies.

The vast majority of techs I know have some ache or pain associated with work and probably 25% have had to have surgery. I think the 90% injury rate is accurate. You should plan on it.

Stretching and strengthening will prevent injury. I’ve only known 1 echo tech (in 7 years) to have significant injury preventing them from scanning and that was solved with proper physio.

5. u/willdabeastest [score=1, created=2025-03-09T16:49:39]: I scan anywhere from 6-9 cases a day. There are times where my shoulder does hurt - ICU patients where I cannot get good ergonomics. Most of the time, if I am conscious of my positioning and use muscles (not joints) to push harder there isn't any pain.
