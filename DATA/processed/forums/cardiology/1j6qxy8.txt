===============================================================================

I'm a cardiologist with the ability to list several credentials after my name but don't want to be pretentious in view of my colleagues but still show what I have to patients and those that refer to me. I have: NAME, MD FACC FASE RPVI DNBPAS I feel that the DNBPAS may be overkill because it is more of a "bought" credential and could go without it. Thinking of going in full on business cards and dropping the last one on notes. Wanted a general sense of what our community thinks of these things. Thanks in advance!

2. u/jsaf237 [score=30, created=2025-03-08T14:58:44]: Gives desperate when more than FACC
3. u/FLCardio [score=55, created=2025-03-08T14:48:26]: Name, MD FACC at most. Realistically anything after MD no is gonna know or care.
4. u/Gideon511 [score=31, created=2025-03-08T14:32:08]: The longer your title the less important you are, less is more
5. u/redicalschool [score=14, created=2025-03-08T14:46:18]: I would say at most "name, MD FACC" Your bio could list your other board certs, but MD, FACC conveys the essentials without being clunky or over the top, regardless of it being at the bottom of a note or on a business card
6. u/aethes [score=11, created=2025-03-08T14:47:54]: MD FACC and nothing else. More feels like over compensation
7. u/supercoolsmoth [score=18, created=2025-03-08T14:12:24]: This would look insane and honestly: who are you trying to impress? Patients? They’ll be confused.
8. u/thehomiemoth [score=7, created=2025-03-09T00:16:46]: If I saw that many letters after your name my eyes would glaze over and I would immediately assume you were an NP.
9. u/doc2025 [score=5, created=2025-03-08T15:19:38]: Just do FACC after MD on day to day signatures for work related stuff. Can list all those other credentials on your website/biography.
10. u/cardsguy2018 [score=12, created=2025-03-08T17:47:53]: Anything after MD is all pretentious.
11. u/MaadWorld [score=12, created=2025-03-08T14:11:09]: Haven't seen any cardiologist put RPVI or DNBPAS
12. u/jiklkfd578 [score=3, created=2025-03-08T19:04:34]: Rpvi or similar would be utterly ridiculous
13. u/Aushosays [score=3, created=2025-03-09T05:18:02]: MD FACC max.
14. u/HumanContract [score=2, created=2025-03-08T15:13:43]: I'll look up the letters after names to see if it's actually an up to date competitive credential or if they're just trying to sell themselves too hard. You can't put down all the letters of the alphabet then be rated as a 1 star review by patients lol.
15. u/SauceLegend [score=2, created=2025-03-09T00:10:30]: I too aspire to be Sauce Legend, MD, AB, CD, EFG, HIJK, LMNOP
16. u/GenXRN [score=2, created=2025-03-09T10:33:00]: Trust me, your patients won’t understand, nor care what the alphabet soup following your name is. You’ll be lucky if they grasp the concept of plumber versus electrician versus project manager. Be a kind and thoughtful doctor. That’s what they want most.
17. u/No_Paramedic_2039 [score=3, created=2025-03-08T17:11:26]: FASE is for the small percentage of echo boarded docs who feel the need to proclaim their specialness by having their buddies attest to their excellence and then paying the ASE for that honor. Insider tip: Just pass the exam and call it a day. No one cares about FASE.
18. u/manda1216 [score=1, created=2025-03-08T19:00:01]: 1-2 after MD only
19. u/xpietoe42 [score=1, created=2025-03-09T02:54:00]: For business purposes or advertising you can include all you want. Potential customers, lay people judge quality by number of letters after the name. It can help you get customers. But for general life, just your name and MD to follow, for your profession is fine
20. u/myspacetomtop5 [score=1, created=2025-03-09T06:36:23]: FACC is enough. Rise above the credential salad docs out there.
