I know that looking for jobs in the area you did fellowship is usually recommended because you would have connections but what if you are trying to look for jobs outside of your region? How do employers look upon people new grads from a different region? How does this change if you were general vs interventional vs EP? Also, any advice when it comes to finding a job these days?

The bottom line is that it is easier to get a local job because you will hear about the jobs (networking), the groups will be more comfortable that you are going to stay long-term, they may know/trust people who recommend you and they may even know you personally. That being said, a lot of this can be overcome by being a little proactive. If you have an area in mind, there is no harm at all in reaching out to groups in that area and letting them know that that is where you would like to be. This will give you an excellent shot at finding a great job. For the most part, it is currently a lot easier to find a job in general cardiology that it is in IC and (especially) in EP. At my primary hospital, there are 3 cardiology groups. Two have hired a general cardiologist in the last year and the other is actively recruiting. Since the last EP and IC were hired by anyone at the hospital (both \~3 years ago) there have been 5 general cardiology hires. No active need here for IC or EP. This is not uncommon. However, I would still not shy away from sub-specializing if it is what you want to do.

4. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-03-10T10:03:22]: Our group doesn't care where you trained so much as where you're from (i.e. your connection to the area). We care far more whether you're gonna leave in a few years. Doesn't matter the subspecialty. Find a job by asking around, using your network, cold calling or job listings. But moving away doesn't protect your reputation, that's naive. Medicine is a small community and people talk.
5. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2025-03-10T15:41:59]: People will want to know what's drawing you (family? ties to the area?) to said new region that you did not do your fellowship in.
6. u/BigAorta [score=1, created=2025-03-11T11:24:25]: We have good data showing majority of times your fellowship location will strongly influence your first job after fellowship so keeping that in mind, I would go to a program where you see yourself having a future tie to the geography
7. u/caffeineismysavior [score=1, created=2025-03-11T20:00:57]: You may be seen as less competitive compared to grads from that region since they don't know you well, unless you come from a program that is very well known nationally. Easy to find general/non-invasive jobs as demand is very high, even in competitive or sought after areas. Interventional, EP and other subspecialties are more difficult as market is not as great. For the latter you may have better chances with those in more rural areas or academic places. When looking for a job, start looking sometime in third year and put your profile up on job boards (NEJM, ACC, Healthecareers etc.). Cold call places if they are looking, you may get lucky because employers find physician recruiters expensive. Be patient - if you don't find a good fit in terms of location, culture or compensation, there will be more jobs out there available for you.
8. u/TheWizardPenguin [score=1, created=2025-03-13T16:23:30]: A lot of jobs come through connections. It's a really small world at the end. Doing your training where you want to settle helps a lot because you get access to jobs otherwise not known.
