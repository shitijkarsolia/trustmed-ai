===============================================================================

Hello everyone, I have been a certified medical assistant for almost 3 years. I was moved to a cardiologist office in May, and have loved it so much more than internal medicine. I recently got my CET so our office could continue to place holter monitors and do our stress tests. Our previous CET moved out of state so it was a quick transition. I am looking to further my education and my career. I love interpreting the holter reports. I have done some extensive google searching trying to understand what the next step up is, but have just gotten more confused. I have seen a CCT or a CRAT, but I haven’t been able to find a direct answer as to what those jobs do on a day to day basis. I eventually want to be able to work from home interpreting holter reports working for some company like iRhythm or Phillips. If anyone could please help break down the cardiology “food chain”, I would greatly appreciate it ❤️

CRAT makes you the interpreter of the holter monitor results and CCT makes you capable of performing stress tests with Doctor oversight. This is a routine day to day thing in an outpatient setting. Good luck to you

Then you can interpret all the Holter reports you want
