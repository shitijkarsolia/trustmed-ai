Was doing UW and came across this. “Although reduced SVR typically leads to a slight decrease in diastolic pressure during exercise, the increase in myocardial contractility and stroke volume causes systolic pressure to rise. This results in an overall increase in afterload due to increased peak LV and aortic pressure during LV contraction” Can someone please explain why afterload increases in exercise? Isn’t it synonymous with TPR and DBP? How are cardiac contractility and SV the deciding factors here and not SVR ? Similarly, In another question on aortic stenosis, one of the options says the same concept “In a patient with AS, LV afterload is determined by the mean systolic blood pressure and the degree of transvalvular obstruction. This patient's acute hypotension would actually cause a reduction in afterload.”

Just remember V = IR, or in this case, pressure (load) = CO x vessel resistance. For AS, if you have a tight valve, it's going to be hard to push blood through it. If you have a tight valve AND there is a ton if pressure behind the valve, it's going to make the load you have to overcome even greater.
2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2025-03-17T21:55:04]: I am not 100% sure what you are asking, but I'll take a crack at it. I think part of the problem here is that the term "afterload" is often tossed around casually. When we are talking about "afterload" we are technically talking about the force opposing sarcomere contraction during systole (minus the amount of opposing force present during diastole). However, by the Young-Laplace equation (with some assumptions) we know that the 'force opposing sarcomere' contraction is directly proportional to the pressure that the blood in the LV must push against to eject blood (this is the systolic blood pressure PLUS any pressure caused by obstructions like aortic and subaortic stenosis). Because of this we often refer to blood pressure (plus any other pressure increase from AS, etc.) as "afterload". This is conceptually, if not technically, correct and is a useful way to think about things. The blood pressure that contributes to the afterload is the blood pressure during SYSTOLE. this means that, technically, the afterload is changing a little as the systolic blood pressure varies. So the DBP is NOT what is creating an afterload. I think the confusion you are facing when you are considering afterload to be related to DBP is with the way the Young-Laplace equation is typically presented in hemodynamic texts. The classic presentation uses the starting systolic blood pressure (along with the radius and thickness of a simplified, cylindrical LV) to illustrate the relationship between pressure and wall tension (force opposing sarcomeres). However, since the "starting systolic blood pressure" is equivalent to the "end diastolic pressure" (a much more common term), that pressure (EDP) is usually placed in the Young-Laplace equation of these explanations. This is the pressure that the heart must overcome to START systole, but (as you know) the average BP in systole is much higher than the EDP and that is the true afterload. Presentaions of the Young-Laplace equation like this is meant to illustrate that the force on sarcomeres during systole is directly proportional to the pressure faced but the LV...nothing more. It is not correct to extrapolate that the average afterload is therefore proportional to EDP (which is only the starting pressure in systole). Does that make sense? It is true that afterload is proportional to SVR at any given time by Ohm's law: ΔP = Q \* R, where ΔP is essentially afterload. However, remember that none of these three variables is in steady-state throughout the cardiac cycle and across different physiologic states; all three are constantly changing. In exercise, R (SVR) goes down but Q (cardiac output) goes up much more, so the net effect is an increase in ΔP. You also know this empirically from observing treadmill stress tests, where the SBP increases significantly. The AS concept is probably one that you are overthinking. Think about what pressure the LV "sees" during systole. It is basically the sum of all the things causing the increase in pressure. In this case, the pressure from AS and the pressure from the VR (vascular resistance). ΔP = ΔPas + ΔPvr or (applying Ohm's law), you can write this in terms of resistances... ΔP = Q \* (Ras+ Rvr). or AFTERLOAD ∝ AS\_Resistance + SVR Assuming constant cardiac output, hypotension means low SVR, which means the afterload will decrease.
3. u/astrofuzzics [score=3, created=2025-03-20T11:06:35]: The question is wrong. U-World often is when it comes to some technical concepts. Blood pressure and after load are two different things. Afterload, from the standpoint of a pure basic-science physiologist, is the tensile force against which a muscle actively contracts. Because the heart is a complex geometric structure with sarcomeres oriented in all kinds of directions, it’s extraordinarily difficult to precisely measure afterload of the heart according to this technical definition, because the axis of contraction of each sarcomere is a little bit different. The physiologic extrapolation that we accept in cardiology is that systemic vascular resistance is more or less equivalent to left ventricular afterload (obviously this ignores the contribution of any aortic stenosis or coarctation, but for a young healthy exercising athlete these are usually irrelevant anyway). Blood pressure is not afterload, and afterload is not blood pressure. The reason these are different is because the relationship between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure depends on the cardiac output. If cardiac output is fixed, a drop in SVR will yield a drop in blood pressure, and a rise in SVR will yield a rise in blood pressure. However, real hemodynamics are interdependent; preload, afterload, contractility, and cardiac output all change depending on how the others change; they never change purely in isolation. A change in afterload will yield a change in cardiac output in an actual person, and it may or may not change the blood pressure. As @dayinthewarmsun described, the relationship between systemic vascular resistance (SVR), cardiac output (CO), right atrial pressure (RAP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) can be described mathematically: MAP - RAP = CO x SVR. In a healthy person, RAP is usually pretty small compared to MAP, so it’s often ignored, simplifying this to MAP = CO x SVR. SVR, in this equation, is more or less synonymous with “afterload.” So what happens to blood pressure when SVR drops? Well, that depends on what happens to the cardiac output! Usually, in response to a reduction in afterload, the cardiac output goes up. With one variable dropping and the other rising, the change in MAP will depend on whether the change in CO outweighs the change in SVR, or vice versa. During isotonic aerobic exercise (swimming, biking, running, rowing - continuous, sustained submaximal effort), the main job of the heart is to increase the delivery of oxygen to aerobically active muscle. At the same time, due to local metabolic effects, the arterioles in working muscle dilate, facilitating the delivery of oxygen. The combined effect is a drop in systemic vascular resistance (afterload), along with a substantial rise in cardiac output multiple times above baseline resting CO. So, what happens to blood pressure? It depends which change is dominant, the drop in SVR or the rise in CO! In healthy individuals, in the vast majority of circumstances, the rise in cardiac output outweighs the drop in SVR, resulting in a rise in blood pressure. This physiology is very well studied and well documented in athletes of multiple skill levels - there is no ambiguity here. Aerobic exercise yields a drop in SVR (afterload), a substantial rise in CO, and a rise in mean arterial pressure. What about isometric exercise? e.g. powerlifting? Sprinting? In this case, the physiology is different. Maximally contracting muscle squeezes blood vessels very tightly, clamping them down and raising systemic vascular resistance (afterload). The heart’s job in these circumstances is not to increase oxygen delivery but to do everything it can to maintain baseline cardiac output in the face of this increased afterload. The result is that cardiac output stays fairly steady while systemic vascular resistance increases substantially. Blood pressure, as you can imagine, goes up really high. Powerlifters participating in experimental measurements have demonstrated arterial blood pressures as high as 400mmHg systolic during maximal effort lifts (can you imagine? The human body withstands that and even benefits from the exercise! Crazy). So, to reiterate, blood pressure is not afterload and afterload is not blood pressure. Afterload is most closely measured by systemic vascular resistance, which requires a measurement of cardiac output. The only way we can predict how a change in SVR (afterload) impacts blood pressure is by understanding how cardiac output is changing at the same time. Measuring blood pressure in isolation, without understanding what’s going on with other hemodynamic variables, is insufficient for measuring afterload. When we take care of patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy in the intensive care unit, sometimes their blood pressure is borderline (90/50), and we place a pulmonary artery catheter to measure filling pressures and estimate cardiac output. We often encounter a scenario in which the cardiac output is quite low and the systemic vascular resistance is quite high, even while the blood pressure is 90/50. What do we do for these patients? We give them sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator! The SVR drops, and often the cardiac output goes up. In many cases the blood pressure stays the same or even paradoxically goes up, as the rise in cardiac output outweighs the drop in SVR. When we remeasure the parameters, we find that the cardiac output is higher and the SVR is lower - even while the blood pressure is the same or a little higher. This is a physiologic response of a sick heart to afterload reduction. Thus, again, afterload =/= MAP. U-world is a great study tool but it’s not gospel. Cheers.
