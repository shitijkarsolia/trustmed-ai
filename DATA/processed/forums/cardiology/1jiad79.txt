1. u/[deleted] [score=4, created=2025-04-05T09:27:12]: advanced heart failure patients are sick. End of stage on palliative milrinone, waiting for a VAD or transplant. they often come in shock. Cool extremities, LFTs up, Cr doubled, low blood pressures. Nearly always necessitating a Swan and starting on ionotropes (milrinone or dobutamine) until you figure out their destination therapy. No one else wants to be primary on these patients. I'm a fellow in a well known Philly program. We have our own advanced HF team with 3 advanced HF attendings. They switch off call every weekend. No other general cardiologist feel comfortable rounding on these patients. The AHF attendings are also expected to cover the CCU more frequently because the vast majority of the patients are end stage HF patients. I'll give you an example of how terrible the work life balance is. We have 3 AHF attendings. In August, one of them took some time off as his daughter was getting married (he was the most senior attending). The 2nd one got seriously ill and had to take medical leave from the hospital for a few months. That left the 3rd, most junior attending. She worked every single day for 2 months straight. Had to come in every single weekend to round on the advanced HF patients because she was the only one who could. Came in for the holidays (Labor Day) to round. Finally the other attendings came back, but the moral is no general cardiologist will round or take responsibility for these patients. On top of that you're coordinating with surgeons for VAD or transplants. Handling scripts of milrinone delivery. And any advanced HF patient, regardless of why they come in, is your patient. AHF will always be primary with other services consulting because no one feels confident in managing these patients. Your milrinone patients you sent home on a PICC line got a line associated infection? Well they're on the advanced HF team inpatient until the infection clears. Your VAD patient has a drive-line infection? Well they're on the AHF teams with Gen surg consulting. Your transplant patient has PNA? Well on the AHF team with ID and Pulm consulting. Literally every decision other attendings, cardiologist as well will defer to you. Should a VAD patient who has a slow Hgb bleed be put back on their coumadin? And if so when? Guess who is making that decision. The AHF pay also isn't that much higher unless you're building up a VAD or transplant program in a hospital system that doesn't have it. But you're going to work to get patients, then form and maintain a good relationship with surgeons. For VADs you then need to follow and have the services for post VAD complications, same with transplant. I know of AHF guys in the philly/philly suburbs/south jersey/north jersey area who built their own programs, but they worked and dealt with a lot of criticism and even legal inquiries regarding who they VAD'ed and who they put on the transplant list. In order to make money in AHF you need to increase the number of patients getting VADs or transplant, but with comes a considerably higher risk at a legal and professional level. So as a AHF doc, you'll be working considerably harder, longer, covering more shifts and you may not make more than your gen car counterparts. I respect those who go into it because of the sacrifice the field takes. You have to live for those moments in clinic where the VAD patient is celebrating his 5th VAD anniversary with his grandchild, or the 45 year old transplant patient watching their child graduate from high school. Those are impactful and beautiful. But they all come at the cost of your life, the attending.
2. u/cardsguy2018 [score=3, created=2025-03-24T18:14:41]: I strongly considered HF but didn't think the stress and lifestyle was worth it. No regrets. I'm perfectly happy in my boring 8-5 M-F general gig making very good money. I end up doing quite a bit of HF in clinic anyway.
