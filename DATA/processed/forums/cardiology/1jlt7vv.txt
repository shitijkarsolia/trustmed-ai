===============================================================================

Hello all I am a UK-based statistician who regularly finds myself working on cardiology projects with clinicians. I have co-authored some peer-reviewed journal articles and worked with data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), the UK Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Registry, and some cardiotoxicity-related datasets. I would like to learn more about cardiology in general and I wondered if anyone here might be able to provide some book or other resources that could be suitable/useful for me. I have a background in Biochemistry from university a long time ago, but no medical training, and all I know about cardiology is some basics that I have gleaned from my clinical colleagues that allows me to perform statistical analyses. Currently I am very interested in cardiotoxicity. Obviously I realise there is an overlap with oncology. Thanks and best wishes RL

I like the Cleveland Clinic board review book, but others might have different recommendations. This might work as a general frame of reference, but it’s also possible the research projects you’re on might be hyperspecialized and you’d need something for a deeper dive

I don't want to assume what level you have been educated to or have gleamed from your experience from your colleagues so please excuse me if i'm telling you things you already know just beginning to read about cardiotoxicity - the papers or texts would assume you already have a background knowledge of the above so might be a bit of a deep dive. i like this book for cardiac physiology: [https://www.elsevierhealth.com.au/cardiovascular-physiology-9780323594844.html](https://www.elsevierhealth.com.au/cardiovascular-physiology-9780323594844.html) This is also a good primer for cardiac physiology: [https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/cardiovascular-system](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/cardiovascular-system) For up to date resources, the european society of cardiology is an excellent resource for education and you will be able to sign up as an associated silver member for pretty cheap. i think its like 80 euro. this gets you access to a lot of the educational material. i used it to study for my echocardiography exams. you might even have access already if you have some institutional access if you work with the tavi database etc. heres an example chapter you can read from the ESC handbook on cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. [https://academic.oup.com/esc/book/35985/chapter-abstract/312040038?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false](https://academic.oup.com/esc/book/35985/chapter-abstract/312040038?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false) Here is a review article on mechanisms of action of cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs - fwiw this is more pharmacolgoy and the field of oncology rather than cardiology.

For any particular topic you’re interested in, there will be a guidelines from AHA, ACC, or ESC (maybe go off ESC since you’re in the UK). These guidelines will be filled with acronyms and esoteric terminology but they always have definitions and subsequent citations. The citations help you drill down on specific questions of pathophysiology if you’re interested. I use them similar to how I use Wikipedia. Since you’re likely academic, your university will allow you to see the individual papers that are referenced in the guidelines For cardio onc toxicity, you can try this link https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/43/41/4229/6673995
5. u/Spintroll28 [score=2, created=2025-03-28T09:42:51]: If you are thinking about cardiotoxicity in the cardio oncology sense then I would go to ICOS (international cardio oncology society) and attend the lectures/webinars to learn more.
