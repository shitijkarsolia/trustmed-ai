Has there been improvements to shielding at all in the past couple of years? Have you seen long-term effects in yourself or your colleagues? Is this something that I should heavily factor in my decision to pursue cardiology?

Sure there’s newer technology but no guarantee that any hospital system will pony up for that. Add to it the nights and sleep deprivation in addition to the stress of high risk procedures in high acuity pts, and it’s enough that I would NEVER recommend this specialty to anyone I care about as I think it jeopardizes your health and lifespan.
2. u/MDSCFL3 [score=14, created=2025-04-03T20:03:26]: I take radiation very seriously as IC. Lead is lead and does its job. Proper radiation technique. But the biggest change is some of the newer camera systems work a whole heck of alot better and have radiation minimizing aspects.
3. u/ChinitoIncognito [score=9, created=2025-04-04T03:36:51]: Like others have said, there have been improvements in equipment (x-ray systems and shielding) and increased focus on radiation safety in the community as a whole. With that being said, your hospital needs to invest in those technologies for you to get any of those protections. If you are like me and work for a hospital that literally wouldn’t care if you died tomorrow, then you will still get blasted with high does of radiation every day from an ancient x-ray system while not being protected by Rampart, Egg Nest, etc. There is increased incidence of left-sided brain tumors in ICs, not to mention increased cataract risk and risk of orthopedic injuries from wearing lead chronically. If you do choose this profession, I’d at least work somewhere that (1) shows commitment to radiation safety or (2) pays you a lot so that you can reap more enjoyment from the shortened life that you will live.

Just as a bit of background, I’ve worked for one of the main Angio manufacturers for the past 19 years and I’ve never seen more momentum about safety as I have in the past year. The answer to your question is yes, there have been significant improvements and options for safety since I started my career in both dose reduction and prevention. For dose reduction, because of advances in detector/tube technology, software and all components of the imaging chain, all manufacturers of Angio systems have made huge leaps in reducing dose. However, much of the dose reduction depends on the physician as well because there is a strong correlation between image quality and dose. If the IC wants higher imaging quality for better soft tissue visualization and less noise, it comes at the cost of higher radiation. Conversely, some ICs are fine with a noisy image with very little dose. The other side of the coin to radiation reduction is protection. Companies like Rampart, Protego, Egg Medical and Radiaction have created shielding systems that reduce scatter radiation to the point that some or all of the in lab staff can shed their lead. This also helps from an orthopedic view as well because wearing 30lbs of lead for years can cause a multitude of problems with your back, knees, etc. My conclusion when talking with anyone getting into the field is the following: 1. Interventional cardiology is one of the most rewarding fields in medicine. Seeing the immediate difference you make in the longevity of a patient is beyond gratifying. 2. There is still a risk of radiation exposure but through proper protection and system use, it can be minimized. 3. There are still technologies that are emerging like remote catheter and guidewire control systems that will continue to reduce the risk. Best of luck in your choice and I’m happy to talk with you if you have any more questions! Feel free to DM me

6. u/tchocktchock [score=5, created=2025-04-04T07:10:09]: Use to do to IC but stopped because of the poor quality of life, mainly sleep deprivation. Did interventional echo for a while but felt the protections were very poor. I focus now on CMR, CT and echo.

8. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2025-04-03T23:16:03]: I know a colleague of mine wears shin guards as he has lost all the hairs on his legs. One of our radiographers also has a partner in IC who was saying her partner's facial hair is about 50% grey on the intensifier side. There's moves to improve it though, we're trialling the Rampart system, a mobile heavy duty shield which is so effective some centres in the US are going lead-free. That said, it's extremely cumbersome and slow, it can take around 2 people and operator 5-10 minutes to prep and get into position, obviously this would be unacceptable in a PPCI situation but it's ideal for CTO where the time taken is paid back.
9. u/kgeurink [score=7, created=2025-04-03T20:00:49]: With lead and the new age systems the exposure is minimal. There is also the rampart and systems like it that are lead free

12. u/fruityuv [score=1, created=2025-04-05T02:18:07]: how would IC and electrophysiology compare in terms of radiation exposure?
13. u/saynocpr [score=1, created=2025-04-05T06:20:58]: It depends. Historically, an IC would receive an annual dose of &lt;10 mSv (or mGy which for practical purpose is about the same in IC). That is about the same amount of an international pilot. Currently, with advances in dose-reduction technology, operator judiciousness of following ALARA techniques, and better shielding is much less than that. E.g. mine as a busy IC + vascular which uses even more radiation due length of cases and use of DSA, is in the low single digits / yr. We use Zero Gravity. I would not work without it or something similar like Rampart or Nest Egg.
14. u/Gideon511 [score=1, created=2025-04-05T07:09:54]: I would say EP probably has even more radiation exposure than IC, but it will vary. There are low flouro and no flouro techniques for ablation, depends in part on how much device work you end up doing, you should pursue a career in what you find interesting and are passionate about in my opinion. If radiation is enough to dissuade you from a career path, you might not be interested enough to begin with. Both IC and EP involve significant stress and sacrifice, it is easier to be a non invasive cardiologist for sure. Do what you love ultimately.
