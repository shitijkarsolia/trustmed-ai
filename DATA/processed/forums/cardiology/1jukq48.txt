===============================================================================

Hey, folks. Looking for advice from techs. I'm currently a student preparing to apply for the diagnostic medical sonography program, but my school doesn't teach cardiac sonography/echocardiography, and cardio is where I want to be. I'm anxious about the stress sonography will put on my 46-year-old body, so I'm trying to decide between echo and cardiovascular tech. I'm probably more interested in CVT at this point, moreso because heart conditions run in our family, and I've learned a lot about it with my dad's trips to the cath lab and my sister's hospital stays with her AFib and other issues. I understand CVT doesn't pay as much as echo, but I don't know if the physical rigor is worth the extra money. Can anybody give me the pros and cons of each? Are there any who've done both and have a favorite? Thanks for any response.

We have a direct and immediate impact on our patient lives, which is increased exponentially during emergencies. If you have specific questions, lmk.

I am currently working as a cardiac technologist, mainly in CVL. There's opportunity to learn echo in the future, but probably in a year or two. The hospital is also giving out sponsorships to take on Masters programme which i can apply for next year. However, recently, I was given the opportunity to join a paediatric hospital, mainly focusing on Echo. I have only joined my current job in CVL for about 5 months and is not Echo trained While I feel that there's a lot to learn for Cath, which is rewarding; and enjoy the adrenaline rush, I really feel drained after every day's work and all I do is have dinner and sleep after work. I work over the weekends too. So i have no life of my own. And this would be worse after I start taking calls. My boyfriend adviced for me to stay till i get sponsored for the masters programme, master CVL while serving the bond, then find another hospital to learn echo and progress myself with my higher qualification and experience in CVL. I am in contemplation if I should resign and go over to the paediatric hospital and would like to get some advice from this. Here's some of the considerations i'm thinking of: Which earns better in the long run while providing a better work-life balance? Which skillset is more valued by the industry in the future when AI takes over? Which skillset would be able to open more doors for me in the future (e.g. if i were to be tired of clinical work and rather do (e.g) research/education/medical sales/management)? any other inputs?

Learn to scan left handed , significantly easier on the neck / shoulders/ wrist / back . It’s almost impossible to have good posture scanning right handed. I would never want to wear lead all day it is awful …. So I would say echo .
