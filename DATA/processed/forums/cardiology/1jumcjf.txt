===============================================================================

Hi everyone! I am a USMD PGY2 planning to apply for cards fellowship. I don’t like my current odds at matching fellowship so have started looking at cardiac Hospitalist jobs to boost the old CV while getting decent pay (have a family to feed) and having better access to research. I’ve seen a couple of job postings for when I would start in the summer of 2026, however, I would still like to take a crack at matching. Does anyone have experience with this? When is an ideal time to start applying for cardiology Hospitalist jobs while also still applying to fellowship? I worry that if I wait until after the match, then they will all be filled. If interested, I am worried about not matching because I am at a community program and it’s been difficult getting a cardiology research project off the ground. I have about 6 non cardiology published authorships from med school. Some strengths to my app are step 1/2 scores (253/257), well trained attendings that would write me good letters, and a PGY3 chief year. Thanks in advanced!

I think you would be fine applying for hospitalist jobs after the fellowship match, should you not match.
2. u/cardio_nerd_121 [score=4, created=2025-04-10T17:04:54]: I am the Director for a Cards Hospitalist program. We begin interviewing in late August/early September and aim to finish hiring by December. Every year, we receive a deluge of applications after Match Day from those who applied and went unmatched. From our perspective, applicants who didn't match are riskier. It wasn't their first choice to come to our program, they may be unhappy with the position, or they may get "stuck" not matching either for several cycles or permanently. Cards Hospitalist jobs are becoming much more common and fellowships don't give preferential consideration for such hospitalists vs general medicine hospitalists. Applicants need to have a great deal of motivation to bolster their applications with research, letters of recommendations, and all the other usual factors all while performing the functions of their job. IMO the comments so far are partly accurate re: "you are in demand as a hospitalist." If you are ok with a general medicine hospitalist job or a cards hospitalist nocturnist position, you will have no problem finding a job if you apply post-match. Quality daytime cards hospitalist jobs are less common and can be more selective. Fellowship application has become incredibly competitive year over year and am often surprised by who doesn't match. Often, not matching comes down to poor strategy. Fellowship application is completely different from residency - the "rules" are way more flexible and it is a lot of networking. You have positive factors going for you: decent Step 1/2 scores, a chief year, and LORs. You should apply broadly (our folks often apply to 100+ programs). I would tailor your application and personal statement to community programs. It will be a waste of time/money/effort to apply to academic/research programs given your research credentials. I'll emphasize this again: you need to network - reach out to connections (current or former fellows) in programs you are interested in, see if they will put in a word about you, and learn from them what is the culture of their program. You can send a quick note to the fellowship coordinator with a brief email selling yourself/your interest in the program/why you are a good fit (based on conversations from your connections). Fellowship programs have limited resources to interview applicants. Many programs only interview 40-50 candidates out of a pool of 1000+ applications. If they see you have done all your training/currently live in MA but are applying to a small community program in OR/WA, they won't bother considering your application (as there's very low probability you would come there, from their perspective). A personal note from you sharing that you are interested in their program, you've talked to fellows there and you believe you'll be a good fit for X/Y/Z reasons, will go a long way for you. You can also leverage your letter writers for interviews at certain programs they may still have connections to. Best of luck!
3. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2025-04-08T17:38:38]: I agree with this comment in terms of timeline. The job jobs will probably want to confirm if you are still applying for Cardiology fellowship so they can plan ahead if you’ll likely be there long-term or not.
4. u/steep_learning_curve [score=1, created=2025-04-09T00:48:37]: do you know which programs have these cardio hospitalist jobs?
