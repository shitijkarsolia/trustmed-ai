===============================================================================

I am applying this coming year and I am more clinically-focused rather than academic. I've read THI is "one of the strongest clinically" over the years on sdn and reddit, but is that still true or simply a function everyone echoing old information. I read THI has combined w/ baylor and is now called THI at baylor college of medicine as of 11/2024, what does that mean? Is there only one fellowship between the 2 institutions? If not, how are cases split between the 2 academic programs? I also read that they lost accreditation for heart transplantation in 2018 (St. Luke's which is their major site) and a lot of faculty turnover occurred. I don't know how its recovered? Is this program strong only in interventional or still a powerhouse in all sub-specialties. I'm still want to keep an option mind clinically of my final subspecialization (who knows what happens with my life circumstance too) and I think getting as many level 2 would be beneficial.

I can’t comment on what’s happened there recently in the past 2-3 years but before, when I was interviewing, I recall that it was actually the Baylor side that was counting procedures done by THI/St lukes as their own. AFAIK the baylor fellows spend a majority of time at their county hospital and VA and only a minority of time at St. Luke’s. IMO, both programs have gone downhill from where they were in the mid 2010s and earlier. Both are still solid programs. THI is attending and midlevel run and can be very cush outside of interventional training, and Baylor is heavily resident run and very cush for fellows. I wouldn’t consider THI a powerhouse for anything other than interventional. It still has a great reputation though bc a lot of the current generation of practicing cardiologists regard the program highly from what they recall from their heyday
2. u/changwufei801 [score=3, created=2025-04-14T13:57:32]: It’s two separate programs administered by the same GME under Baylor College of Medicine. Baylor and THI fellows have separate faculty and rotations. Baylor fellows rotate through the county hospital, VA and St Luke’s. THI fellows rotate exclusively at St Luke’s on inpatient services. The county hospital and VA are definitely lower volume than St Luke’s which is private. Even at St Luke’s the Baylor cardiologists are usually staffing a lower volume service than the THI guys. You get a more typical academic experience at Baylor - staffing ICU and cardiology services filled with interns and residents. There’s more rounding and teaching. THI feels more like an apprenticeship where it’s you with the advanced fellows/attending. THI is higher volume when it comes to procedures just because of the practice setting. Both programs produce a lot of interventional cardiologists/EPs. People who want to do advanced imaging go across the street to Methodist. There are separate interventional fellowships for Baylor and THI. Theoretically it’s a shared EP program but 80% of the grads are from THI.
3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-04-14T16:19:10]: There has been movement between THI and baylor, not just at the program level but even the institutional level. To find out the details you'll just have to apply and interview. The only people who know the details are in that building not reddit. I know multiple THI alum going as far back over a decade or so. My colleague is an alum. My co-fellow is an attending there. I interviewed there myself. I'm not sure how they've supposedly gone downhill or what that even means. Or why you think things have changed over the years. Things really don't change all that much. By and large it seems the same from what I hear. It was and still seems clinically strong. The fellows get to see and do a lot and have a ton of autonomy. It's always been the IC powerhouse though with solid EP and HF. No one really seems to care about CT/MRI there. Most attendings are private/employed and not all that academic. It was the only interview where they said private practice isn't a bad word, lol. But really the attraction of the program is major hospital volume and breadth w/o any of the academic stuff in a solid city. Moreover, at least when I interviewed it sounded pretty nice and really stuck with me as a non-academic type. 2nd/3rd year were easy, additional stipend, moonlighting, guaranteed advanced fellowship spots. But really a lot of this stuff doesn't really matter in the real world and most programs will train you perfectly well. I wouldn't worry too much about level 2 either. Also, I'm aware of the problems the Tx program had. My coresident was a fellow there around that time and I was interested in HF so we talked a lot. There's a bunch of things that went on but I don't recall any faculty turnover outside of hiring new surgeons.
4. u/_Gandalf_Greybeard_ [score=1, created=2025-04-14T10:33:37]: Are you sure about the combined part? They have separate websites with a separate list of fellows. THI fellows work at CHI St Luke's while Baylor fellows rotate at St Luke's, VA and Ben Taub as well if I'm not mistaken. THI is much harder to get into and more prestigious. They also only take their own for further training in IC,EP etc, so that's an advantage.
5. u/CardioSource [score=3, created=2025-04-15T05:04:06]: Speaking from someone who was a THI fellow prior to the merger, the overall quality of the program has definitely decreased. THI used be top 5 program(especially with regards to IC). Now it’s nowhere near that. As much as it pains me to say it “the glory days are over.” Will you get a good training - yes. If you’re a good enough candidate to get in a top 5 program - look elsewhere.
6. u/HumanContract [score=1, created=2025-04-17T03:54:31]: Baylor CHI St Lukes or whatever religious affiliation they throw in there (it's so hard explaining how many names this hospital has) is a very old hospital that is way past it's time. Most of it's cardiologists left for Memorial Hermann down the street years ago, and even they are leaving that hospital slowly for greener pastures... St Lukes operates in the red and is so close to shutting down (check their finances). Their CVRR unit has pods with 4 to 8 beds in it, then separates cardiac devices between their ICUs. The hospital in itself doesn't function well, and even the McDonalds picked up and left. I don't think there are many great learning experiences for anyone who rotates through there, honestly. Their turnover is very high for all jobs.
7. u/just_calm_47 [score=1, created=2025-04-17T23:34:02]: What programs would be the best for interventional cardiology could you please suggest I will be applying next yr and would like to work on them.
8. u/DTOM-ILLY [score=1, created=2025-10-02T04:45:41]: As a current cardiology fellow in NYC was wondering if THI IC would take an external applicant?
9. u/Fragrant-Rain-7605 [score=1, created=2025-11-15T09:25:20]: My understanding is THI is where you go to St. Lukes and get more of the advanced exposure vs normal baylor fellowship is not as good as you are mainly at a county hospital and the va. This will change years from now once the merger is finalized but for now THI is still superior
10. u/lemonjalo [score=1, created=2025-04-14T11:57:13]: I work with Baylor fellows at one of their rotation sites and i heard it’s combining
