===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I matched into a community IM program with university affiliations &amp; an in house cardiology fellowship. Was wondering what the general timeline &amp; journey looks like from those of you who have done it. What can I do starting now to set myself up to match at my hospital’s cardiology program? Appreciate you all, thank you in advance.

For internal successful matches, see tips below: - be the best internist. Cliche advice but very true. Your cards PD doesn’t want someone who’s “smart” at cards - they will teach you that. They want the best internal med doc in their class - get to know the PD and have face time with them either through rotations, cards lectures, cards grand rounds, educational symposiums - goes without saying but make sure the fellows like you - have a good reputation and also do not brush off non-cards electives bc most PDs will even ask other specialty attendings (endo, rheum, ID) what they thought of you and how your behavior was - be easy going and flexible to work with. You do not want to be known as the resident who rocks the boat Best of luck!!

If you want to do a research project or case report, be the one to do the heavy work. Get as much face time as possible with those who you want to ask for letters
