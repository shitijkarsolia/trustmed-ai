How important is research (publications) when applying for fellowship?

My impression from the interview trail is that all the university places really want fellows who are researchers that can fill clinical duties and not so much clinicians who do a little research.
2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2025-04-24T00:09:34]: Important. There are extremely few (&lt; 0.1%) of applicants who have done practice-changing research. Also, programs (including academic ones) understand that the majority of their graduates will be in clinical practice (little-no research). However, research hi lights desirable qualities in an applicant (or a cardiologist): \- Intellectual curiosity. \- An interest or passion in something. \- Ability to complete a project (or a part of one). \- Ability to collaborate. \- A long standing interest (didn't decide on cardiology last minute). \- Ability to handle excess work (above just getting through residency/life). Because of this, it is very important. Don't focus too much on getting a high-impact journal or on changing the world with your research right away. Use your research to demonstrate your interests and other positive qualities.

4. u/147zcbm123 [score=4, created=2025-04-22T17:15:29]: I am but an M4 but based on what I understand, pretty damn important. Sine cardiology is pretty competitive you need to stand out, and you do that with pubs as well as other research and non-research endeavors.
5. u/supadupasid [score=1, created=2025-04-23T21:27:21]: i think its really important
6. u/leonidasturtle [score=1, created=2025-05-06T17:31:03]: Very important. Most of us know you won't necessarily have quality work when you are in training. We want to see that you are interested in cardiology and are able to successfully take a task and finish it through (i.e., get a paper to publication).
