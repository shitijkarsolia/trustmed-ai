Hi guys! This isn’t necessarily a medical question in its sense but I need some help/ ideas from people who have practiced this field. My husband is graduating from his cardiology program this summer and going into interventional next. I would really to gift him something he can use at work, I thought of a nice stethoscope but he already has one passed down from his dad that has sentimental value to him. Is there anything you would have loved to receive as a gift while practicing? Best, S

I wear crocs though because I’m cheap. As someone who was an IC fellow 3 years ago, buy him something related to a hobby for decompression/prevention of burnout. Get him a PS5 or Switch or a peloton, etc etc. Good luck!

My wife got me hoka one one shoes for the cath lab and it was an absolute game changer. I had like 4 stethoscopes by the time I started my IC year. If you wanna get him something for his job and something for his down time I think he’d really love it.
