===============================================================================

Hi everyone! I'm currently in my final year of cardiology residency and planning to pursue a career in electrophysiology. As part of my training, I’ll be spending two months in an EP unit in a huge hospital. To make the most of this opportunity, I'd like to arrive with a stronger foundation than what residency alone has provided. I’m looking for book or resource recommendations (textbooks, courses, podcasts, etc.) to help deepen my understanding of EP before I start. Note: I’m fluent in English, but Spanish is my native language. Thanks in advance for your help!

Boston Educare website, register as if you're from US and look for EP 101 video lecture package - there should be 2, try the one from 2023 (its free and perfect for entry level EP) edit: also look for any lecture by Samuel Asirvatham, theyre pure gold
2. u/[deleted] [score=6, created=2025-05-01T05:11:57]: There are two easy to digest fundamental “handbooks” one by Murgatroyd. Another by Andrade. Good reads for first year EPs starting out Edit: sorry forgot to say these are a bit better for the EP lab. For clinical on the floor stuff I agree with others who mentioned EP SAP
3. u/ConnerVetro [score=3, created=2025-05-01T05:40:26]: Reginald Ho book.
4. u/rads2riches [score=5, created=2025-05-01T10:00:03]: 1. https://www.epfellowssummit.com/ 2. https://www.aphrs.org/attachments/Warren-Jackman-Art-of-War.pdf Free and awesome book on how Dr Jackman (one of the founders on modern EP) approaches EP. 3. Second the Josh Cooper YT training.
5. u/Mitchthe2nd [score=2, created=2025-05-01T16:52:16]: Hi there This website has a full EP course. 140 lectures and quizzes. Can provide to you for free if you DM me. Normally $3k. https://cardiacphysinpractice.com/ep-in-practice/
6. u/Gideon511 [score=2, created=2025-05-01T05:27:01]: I recommend going to cardiotext.com and browsing the EP section, there are a ton of resources there. EP SAP is also a good resource, as are HRS board reviews.
