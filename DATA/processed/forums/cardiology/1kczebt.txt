Has anyone got certificate from CBNC after passing their boards this year? How long do they take to send them or they even send it?

I believe you have to email the CBNC with proof of your medical license and proof of passing general Cardiology boards to convert your status from testamur to diplomate. You can see if you’re a diplomate on your APCA profile. My hospital system requested that I send them my certificate, and said the status letter of “diplomate” from the APCA did not count. Called the CBNC by the number listed on the APCA website just this week. They told me they had been having problems with their printer (?) and certificates were sent late this year. They “think” they sent my certificate just a few days ago by USPS. Because it was important to reading privileges at my hospital I asked them to pretty please send me a digital certificate. They said that’s unusual for them to do, but they did send me a PDF of the certificate after about a day. Hope that helps.
