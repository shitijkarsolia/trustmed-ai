Greetings, cardiology friends :) It's that time again - time for another cardiology paper review. This time I have done a deep dive into the SPRINT (**Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention**) Trial The SPRINT trial, initially published in \*NEJM\* in 2015, investigated whether intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) control (&lt;120 mm Hg) reduced cardiovascular events compared to a standard target (&lt;140 mm Hg) in high-risk, non-diabetic patients. It became one of the most influential blood pressure trials in decades, shaping US and other jurisdictions' guidelines - but also raising methodological debates around early stopping, composite outcome interpretation, and real-world implementation. In this review, I unpack the trial design, statistical validity, generalisability, and implications for cardiologists and researchers. # I. Introduction &amp; Background The **Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)**, published by Wright et al. (2015), was a landmark, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT) that tested a simple but important question: would targeting a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 120 mm Hg - rather than the standard 140 mm Hg - reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk, non-diabetic individuals? SPRINT was conceived in a landscape of uncertainty. Previous trials had shown inconsistent results. The ACCORD-BP trial (2010) tested similar intensive blood pressure targets in people with diabetes but failed to demonstrate a clear mortality benefit. HYVET (2008) showed benefits of treating hypertension in people aged over 80 but did not address lower BP targets. Meanwhile, clinical guidelines varied widely. At the time SPRINT began, American and European recommendations diverged, especially in older populations and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). SPRINT was not only statistically well designed but also strategically scoped to address gaps left by previous studies. Its impact has been substantial—reshaping US guidelines and contributing to global debate on the optimal level of BP control. In this review, we assess the trial’s statistical and methodological rigour, highlight key findings, and explore implications for clinical practice and policy. # II. Trial Design and Methodology SPRINT was a multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group RCT with blinded outcome adjudication. Conducted across 102 clinical sites in the United States and Puerto Rico, the study enrolled 9,361 adults aged 50 years or older with SBP between 130 and 180 mm Hg and increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes or prior stroke (Ambrosius et al., 2014). 👉 \[Read the full review here\](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews/sprint/)

1. u/hoyaMD [score=2, created=2025-05-08T18:39:05]: Can you please explain why early termination overestimates effects?
2. u/LalalaSherpa [score=2, created=2025-05-08T19:33:38]: I like your distinction between "foundation" vs "blueprint" in the final para.
3. u/SelfMadeMe [score=2, created=2025-05-08T23:39:24]: "In contrast, European and UK guidelines remain more cautious." - disagree with that, newest ESC guidlines clearly state a target BP of 120mmHg systolic for the majority of the population, excluding very old, frail people. Would have wished for the analysis to go deeper into statistical analysis not only simply state that external validity is low. This mostly reads as an opinion piece for me.
4. u/CaramelImpossible406 [score=1, created=2025-05-11T08:03:18]: Do you think we would have seen somehow different results if this study was conducted in inpatient wards where patients are admitted for non-hypertensive/non-cardiac cases but then developed hypertension unrelated to effects of fever, anxiety, and so on?
5. u/TaintNoBigs [score=1, created=2025-05-11T12:40:33]: SBP targets less than 120 mmHG in individuals that arent high risk or established HFrEF is nothing but a way to try and medicate people unnecessarily. It
