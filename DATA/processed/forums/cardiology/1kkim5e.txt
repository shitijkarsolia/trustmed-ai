Hello to the /Cardiology community, first post here, I'm a critical care paramedic, I got somehow dragged in and involved on a case during one of my travels, not registered in the coutry where this occurred. I have had mixed opinions from physicians I spoke with (various specialties) and I feel like this community might give a different insight on this case: Patient: 77M, asymptomatic, routine ECG for sports clearance. Current ECG flagged by sport phyiscian as "AF". GP minimize and ignore my concerns for current therapy as troubling, refers to cardiology and taks to patient about ablation (lol). BMI 30, No history of syncope, CP, SOB, fatifue or known arrhythmia. Well hydrated, moderate/occasional alcohol consumption, no notable consumption of caffeine. Previous ECG 12 months ago: NSR. PMHx: HTN, mild T2DM (patient unaware, no dietary adjustment or specialist follow-up), No documented hx of heart failure, tachyarrythmias nor AF. Last bloods 16 months ago: slightly reduced eGFR, lipids overly suppressed, borderline HbA1c. Current meds prescribed by old GP, retired couple of month ago after 40+ years of career and unchanged for last 2+ years, never reviewed by new GP: Atenolol 100mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, ASA 100mg, Alfuzosin 2.5mg, Olmesartan/HCTZ 40/12.5mg, Metformin 850mg https://preview.redd.it/2rdvxwzio90f1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1945af1253db1f0ffad29d71c9b5470a2b1cdb5e My interpretation: * ECG shows regular atrial activity at \~240 bpm, clear in V1/V2. * Ventricular response \~80 bpm with variable AV conduction. * Possibly focal atrial tachycardia with AV node protective filtering, even tho the atrial rate is more suggestive of Atrial Flutter, however without the typical saw-tooth pattern * Don't feel like ruling out 2nd-degree AV block Mobitz II, simply from a risk stratification perspective * Old GP went on a old school "prevention-dosing spree" My raccomendations to the current GP (which seemed not interested in owning the patient but just to offload responsability to the cardiology referral): * Discontinue ASA and alfuzosin * Taper atenolol (50mg to zero), consider short-acting B-blockers if needed * Cut statin to 40mg or lower, reassess lipids * Request bloods (electrolytes, CK, HbA1c, lipids, LFTs, renal panel), * Repeat ECG in 2 weeks, 24h Holter if still altered * Refer to cardiologist + diabetic clinic Red Flags / Doubts / discussions : 1. Is this truly AF? I'm incline to refuse the AF generalization due to regular atrial activity which argues against it. 2. Could this be focal AT with AV filtering instead? The Flutter/atrial re-entry option stands? At what point misinterpretation get rectified? 3. Could beta-blocker overdose (atenolol 100mg) + alfuzosin be masking or contributing to AV node dysfunction? 4. Any justification for 80mg atorvastatin in a low-risk, asymptomatic primary prevention case? Any relevance to possible statin-induced myopathy, apart from possible reduced renal function or potential ↓K ↓Mg? I guess there would be other symptoms? 5. Again, justification for HCTZ without evidence/history of HF/severe hypertension? and possible contribution to electrolyte disturbances? 6. What would your diagnostic next steps apart from a 24h holter be, before labeling this as pathological AV block or other, It seems to me vasovagal manouvers or atropine tests would be a bit cowboy-ish and probably an overreaction? Would appreciate any input and discussion/critique considering my experience is limited to prehospital, ICU and some primary care, but some of the nuance and elegance is lost on me.

1. u/shahtavacko [score=21, created=2025-05-11T20:52:27]: This is atrial flutter until proven otherwise, therefore he needs to be anticoagulated. No more aspirin needed. I disagree with cutting atenolol unless you really want him tachycardic. Don’t see the need to discontinue alfuzosin. I cannot comment on the atorvastatin dose until I see a lipid panel. Doesn’t need a holter, a repeat ecg in a week or two would pretty much tell you he’s persisting in this (which will likely be the case as atrial flutter is a stable and stubborn rhythm). He needs an echocardiogram though. There is no vital sign here other than the heart rate (or I’m missing it, despite reading this a couple of times), so no reason to change his antihypertensive drug either. I agree with doing labs of course. Oh, and there’s no AV dysfunction here, this is atrial flutter with variable block, the lower rate is likely due to the atenolol.
2. u/AngryOcelot [score=20, created=2025-05-11T21:11:56]: This is atrial fibrillation. V1 and V2 look regular because the right atrial appendage has regularized conduction into it in this case. If you put up intracardiac catheters you will be variable cycle length and activation pattern. Patient requires anticoagulation and then rate versus rhythm control depending on many factors.
3. u/[deleted] [score=18, created=2025-05-11T23:42:31]: That’s a lot of overthinking for AF. It’s AF. Someone might say it’s atypical type 2 flutter. But it doesn’t matter. It’s rate controlled due to the atenolol and if he is asymptomatic then great it’s doing its job. If he doesn’t mind the statin leave him on it. Talk to him about the benefits and risks of anticoagulation and if he chooses it stop the aspirin.
4. u/WSUMED2022 [score=11, created=2025-05-11T23:40:49]: Where is this that the paramedics make medical recommendations to the medical team?
5. u/LalalaSherpa [score=4, created=2025-05-11T20:52:40]: What's his BP &amp; what do you consider borderline A1C?
6. u/FielderXT [score=4, created=2025-05-12T03:10:19]: I’d say this is afib until proven otherwise. Yes it’s a little coarse in v1 but the TP segments, particularly the inferior leads, are flat — suggesting there is no constant clockwise or anticlockwise circuit of electrical activity that would be characteristic of flutter.
7. u/kttrphc [score=3, created=2025-05-12T04:24:30]: This is afib. As his age is 75 plus with htn history, his chadvasc will be high enough to start anticoagulation. At this age, strategy should be to do echo- lv function, la and laa assessment, pulm pressure estimation. Continue rate control and start anticoagulation. Anti hypertensive and lipid lowering agents dose to be titrated based on bp, lipid levels
8. u/dildo_wagon [score=4, created=2025-05-12T17:10:37]: Wtf why are we cutting statin? Also i don’t think 2nd degree AVB. There’s some prolongation and a dropped p but at the very end of strip in V1 there are 2 nonconducted p waves which seems more flutter to me. I’d say atypical flutter.
9. u/karlkrum [score=3, created=2025-05-12T18:37:20]: I won't even try to interpret the ekg in this sub but a quick glance looks like afib to my IM pgy1 eyes, chadsvac 4 so start anticoagulation. 6.7% risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism
10. u/supmua [score=4, created=2025-05-12T02:00:19]: My 2 cents: -AT is quite rare &lt;10% of SVT, unlikely. -surface ECG to me looks like atrial flutter, possibly isthmus dependent/typical type (unless disproven in EP lab). -this is either aflutter or fib. -in the US there are specific guidelines for AF/Flutter management. CHA2DS2-VASc score dictates the need for AC therapy. -cardiology referral is the right thing to do, minimizes confusion.
11. u/bachmannsbundle [score=4, created=2025-05-11T20:57:39]: \- Looks like atrial tachycardia (AT) w/ variable conduction versus AFlutter w/ variable conduction. The isoelectric segment between P waves makes me favor AT in a structurally normal heart/no prior surgery/no prior ablation. That said, in the GP setting, very reasaonable to start anticoagulation for possible atrial flutter. \- The olmesartan/HCTZ is for hypertension, nothing wrong with this choice. Atenolol was probably also for HTN, but is now helping control ventricular rates in AT. \- Hard to judge AV node dysfunction in a rapid rhythm, but nothing here points to AV node dysfunction, so not sure why you would stop the atenolol. Not my favorite anti-HTN med, but it's controlling the AT right now \- Can't judge appropriateness of statin dose without knowing prior and current lipids and what is "overly suppressed". With known diabetes (borderline A1c on metformin, so probably higher before) and (presumably) elevated lipids at some point, statins are very appropriate.
12. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2025-05-11T21:01:21]: Flutter
13. u/noltey22 [score=1, created=2025-05-13T10:15:06]: Looks possibly to be atrial flutter, though would have to push adenosine to know for sure. No need to anticoagulate upfront until you figure out what’s going on. nothing I can see is consistent with AV nodal disease.
