===============================================================================

Hello everyone happy Saturday! As the title says I am an incoming DO student at Rowan Virtua SOM previous UMDNJ. I have spent a good amount of time volunteering and researching in various cardiology departments across Brooklyn(where I grew up) and NJ. All of this had led me to have a very strong interested in the cardiology! I know as a DO I will have a "harder" time through the process but that does not intimidate me, I am ready for it. What I am curious about is how can I improve my application so that when the time comes I apply to fellowship I will be as competitive as some of my MD applicants. Things I plan to do: I will take **both** COMLEX and USMLE. My school **requires** that we do research + I will do my best to get involved in cardiology research during school. I read that applying to a IM residency that has an in house cardiology fellowship is a good idea and I plan to do just that. There are a good amount of cardiology programs in my area/affiliated with my school. I was thinking about cold emailing some of the faculty/APDs/PDs and explaining to them my situation and saying that I would be interested in getting involved in research/volunteering/etc... with them. Does this sound silly/unprofessional? I feel like it would be a good way to make connections/get experience but is it weird to just email a cardiologist and ask them for that? I would really appreciate any advice/anything I missed. If you got this far in this long ass post thank you so much!!

I would consider being open-minded about specialties before you close the doors because you never know when you may discover something brand new that you like. For now, I would focus on making sure to adjust to medical school and taking care of your mental health, as well as studying hard during pre-clinicals. Above all pass your boards. You can network plenty during clerkships if you want to meet other cardiology fellows/cardiologists, and even start going to conferences then if you want. For now, enjoy being a student.
