===============================================================================

Hi all, I’m soon to graduate EP fellowship and am in the process of interviewing for jobs. These are my top two at the moment, and I was hoping some seasoned EPs could share a little of their guidance. Job 1: Upstate NY (HCOL, high taxes) Formerly a private group, now purchased by a large healthcare system. 5 current EPs (three 20ish years out, one 10 years out, one 5 years out), looking to add a 6th. 4 total EP labs, one of which is for devices only. Average of 2.5 days/week lab, 2.5 days/week clinic. Typical lab day is 2-3 outpatient cases +/- 1 add-on inpatient device. FaraPulse for all AFs. Strong APP support. Clinic is 20-40 patients per day, depending on if you see work solo vs with 1-2 APPs (MD usually sees new consults, APPs see follow-ups and stable devices). Outreach clinic 2 times per month with limited support (ie you do your own device checks). See inpatient consults between cases on lab days, read Holters/Zios/ILRs/remotes between clinic patients. $650,000 guaranteed for the first 2 years, then $60/RVU. Current EPs doing 12,000-15,000 RVUs/year. Heavy on MDT and BSX for devices, seldom use Abbott. Also Carto heavy, have Rhythmia for FaraPulse, but no EnSite. 4 weeks PTO (this is my biggest reservation). Rotating General Cardiology fellows help with consults, and if interested scrub in the lab with you on their elective blocks. Call would be 1:6. EP covers TVPs overnight, on average they told me expect to have to go in 2-3 times/year overnight. Good public schools. They are looking for someone with a particular interest in extraction and VT. Good relationship with CT surgery. LAAO is shared with IC 50/50, Watchman only, no Amulet. Job 2: Suburban/Rural Midwest (LCOL, low taxes) Also formerly a private group, now employed. 4 current EPs, looking to add a 5th. Much younger group: one senior guy who has been there 25 years, one who is 3 years out of fellowship, and two who are completing their first year out of fellowship. Really good vibes at dinner as all are friendly, and the young attendings are in a similar stage of life as I am (young kids, first time homeowners, etc). 4 EP labs across 2 hospitals. Similar 2.5 days/week clinic (25-30 patients per day) and 2 days/week lab. Their lab is much more efficient, 4 cases per day at minimum. Have Carto, Ensite and Rhythmia. All FaraPulse for AFs. Watchman and Amulet, though these are done in the cath lab and shared with IC, so unable to do concomitant PVI + LAAO. Excellent relationship with CT Surgery. Less robust APP support. No fellows. Half a day a week is blocked off for consults (clinic patients in the AM, hospital consults in the PM). Call would be 1:5. TVPs are covered by IC and cath lab, so really never have to go in at night. Have to round at both hospitals on the weekends. $775,000 guaranteed for 1 year, then $62/RVU. Current partners are doing between 16,000-20,000 RVUs per year (!!) and the 3 young attendings all hit the productivity threshold 10ish months into their first year. 8 weeks PTO. Have a good relationship with Abbott, MDT and BSX. Recently started using AVEIR, are in negotiations with Medtronic for Affera/Sphere-9. Looking for someone with an interest in extraction, PVCs and leadless PPMs. Most MDs in the system send their kids to private school. I should note that these are both initial offers, with Job 1 kind of reluctant to negotiate (have to go through HR for a large system) and Job 2 open to negotiating.

1. u/andrenodick [score=71, created=2025-05-19T18:16:44]: I don’t have any advice because I’m still in training but just wanted to say that I appreciate posts like this that transparently discuss specifics about jobs! Super helpful for those of us that want to plan our lives/careers. Thank you for taking the time to share!
2. u/ConnerVetro [score=19, created=2025-05-19T18:27:05]: The piece of info missing here is the rvu threshold for base salary. But the $/rvu after threshold is about right.
3. u/AngryOcelot [score=7, created=2025-05-19T20:06:54]: Tough decision. Ultimately, I'd probably decide based on where you'd like to live. Money is nice but at this point the returns are diminishing. As you pointed out, the difference in PTO is large. That clinic in option 1 seems heavy so I'd make sure there isn't pressure from the hospital to see more new consults. That is a common gripe among colleagues. Keep in mind that your stress level will be high for low RVU compensation if they're looking for a VT ablator /extractor. Sounds like you've considered most of the relevant details. Best of luck!
4. u/Unable_Locksmith4524 [score=4, created=2025-05-19T20:24:15]: How often do you have to round on both hospitals for the second job? That might not be sustainable in the long run.
5. u/bachmannsbundle [score=9, created=2025-05-19T17:47:36]: I dont have much to contribute as a fellow myself, but for my own future planning, curious if you're looking for jobs as a July 2025 graduate or a July 2026 graduate
6. u/Gideon511 [score=5, created=2025-05-19T17:50:35]: My job is similar to Job 1, I like this job, depends on where you want to live, personally would take job 1 over job 2
7. u/changwufei801 [score=4, created=2025-05-20T09:50:52]: All good points already made - only thing I would add is if group is not sharing at least a portion of RVUs I’m not going to become the complex VT and extraction guy. It’s not fair to spend the whole day on 2 complex VTs and get 40% of the RVUs as someone who breezed through 5 afibs with PFA.
8. u/ElkHairCaddis01 [score=3, created=2025-05-19T19:48:11]: 16-20k wRVUs is cooking. What’s median nowadays for EP?
9. u/jiklkfd578 [score=3, created=2025-05-20T05:11:15]: Below avg rvu payout but that doesn’t always tell the true story as if it’s an efficient system with high end rvu potential (which it sounds like) then you can’t go wrong. So I say decent or fair jobs. So then it’s about fit (location, etc) Not rvus are created equally but in general it’s pretty easy for an ep to hit 12-15k.. 20K+ you’re busy.
10. u/juutii [score=3, created=2025-05-20T12:49:14]: general cards here. but seems like 2 fairly good offers. if assuming location factors (safety, schools, local restaurants/shopping/lifestyle, proximity to international airports etc) are fairly equal, and going off of JUST the job factors, i would have opted for job 2 myself. \-- more pto \-- more money (not just the guarantee, but $2 rvu makes a difference. if you're doing 12k rvus/year thats 24k difference \-- more colleagues in similar stages of life where your families and kids might vibe together easily. \-- though more freq calls, it would suck to go in just for a tvp at night, even if it's infrequent at job 1.
11. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-05-21T01:06:10]: Pay patterns and practice habits vary a whole lot by region and setting (type of practice, rural/urban, etc.). The $/rvu seems competitive. Beyond that...while it is true that "the devil is in the details" I always advise graduating fellows to make sure that the cardiologists in the group (not just the sub-specialists) are (1) retained and (2) happy with their jobs after about 2-3 years of practice. That is going to give you a much better idea of how the whole package adds up than worrying about one contract detail vs another. If I were you, since both are broadly competitive , I would go with either group if you can see yourself being fulfilled there. Also, remember that getting a medical contract attorney to review the offer is normal and expected. You should do that to make sure that there are no predatory or unexpected terms of the contract.
12. u/Watchmaker2014 [score=4, created=2025-05-19T17:49:50]: What’s the RVU thresholds for them?
13. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-05-20T08:47:22]: Where does your family want to live? Which job gave you the better gut feel and had happy workers (not just doctors)? Any red flags? What's the turnover like? Job 2 having so many new guys is a bit curious. But you haven't said anything about the hospital (culture, leadership, finances, etc.) as that can affect you too. We can discuss numbers, rvu, call, clinic, etc. all we want but in the end it's more about the people you work with, the culture and vibe, support, hospital leadership, etc.
14. u/hawwas03 [score=2, created=2025-10-23T13:08:59]: curious which did you pick or if it was another job and do you think you made the right choice? Thanks for sharing job information like this anyway
