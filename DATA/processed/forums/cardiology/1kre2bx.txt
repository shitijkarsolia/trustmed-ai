Patient comes in with inf stemi, but no av block. You activate cath lab, do successful pci, should you start him on a bb immediately after, to optimize his medical treatment, given his pulse tolerates the bb? And also what if the patient came in with inf stemi + av block. No sign of block on the post pci ecg. Then again should you start bb immediately? A question from a very junior resident on the field. Appreciate the patience

A lot of our data in terms of beta blocker usage after MI comes from the pre-reperfusion era. In a patient with a preserved LVEF, multiple recent studies that showed little utility certainly in long-term beta blocker usage. So in my mind, there’s no rush, unless the LVEF is low, in which instance I would start beta blocker alongside your regular guideline director medical therapy (assuming of course they’re not shock-y). In your second scenario, I would be even more hesitant. let the patient rest and see how their rhythm plays out over the next 12 to 24 hours at a bare minimum before adding beta blockade

We had patienta go into cardiogenic shock when an overzelous housestaff started metoprolol the morning after the patient's STEMI.
