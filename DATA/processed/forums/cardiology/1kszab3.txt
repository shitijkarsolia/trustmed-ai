Are there inpt cards services that function as a hospitalist? Do they generate as much RVU as output/echo readings? The week on week off is just so nice

But I’d caution that while the week-on/week-off sounds appealing, it can be deceptively intense. These roles often come with high census, nonstop consults, and constant decision-making without much downtime. Burnout is real, especially when there’s no buffer like clinic variety or procedural work

Inpatient generally has fewer RVU per encounter (exceptions like CC billing exist) but, depending on your model, there can be a lot of encounters. Schedule is less predictable for the days you are on. You have less value to the health system (because you don't own the patients) and you operate at the mercy of a hospital. What are your goals here?

5. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-05-23T07:57:25]: Sounds terrible, especially if you're primary. But doing clinic M-F, having every weekend free and being able to attend all my kids events during the week is very nice.
