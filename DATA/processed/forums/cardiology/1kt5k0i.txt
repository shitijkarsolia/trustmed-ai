===============================================================================

Hello everyone. I’m relatively new to following Reddit communities, and this sub has been really helpful. So firstly, thank you to everyone. I am at the tail end of my first year of fellowship and confused about pursuing interventional cardiology. I have always wanted to pursue interventional ever since I had decided to be a cardiologist, but it’s only in the last few months that I have been having doubts about it, although I am still inclined more towards pursuing it than not. I really enjoy procedures and the critical nature of interventional along with the theoretical side of it too (although I do understand that this excitement fades away with time). I know IC earn more but there is also the opportunity cost of that 1 extra year of fellowship. And mainly the intense and consuming lifestyle of IC. I am starting to feel a little tired and drained out already at the end of my first year lol. I know it is going to be a personal decision in the end, but I would really appreciate any input/ advice from you all about the pros and cons that you see and how you made the decision in your own case. 1. In terms of RVU compensation and earning difference between non invasive vs interventional 2. How tough/easy it is to find an interventional job with a decent lifestyle balance? 3. Job opportunities? 4. If you could go back, would you change your decision of being a non invasive vs an interventionalist? Thank you so much once again. And I apologize for the long post.

The highest earners in my practice are gen cards who read large numbers of studies, and they have a fraction of my stress. The fun and games of the cath lab faded rather quickly for me, after a few years it was just stressful work. There is absolutely nothing exciting anymore about coming in in the middle of the night. My plan is to hang up my lead in another two years and be a general cardiologist for the second half of my career, for a significant QOL upgrade.
2. u/jiklkfd578 [score=26, created=2025-05-22T17:12:02]: 1. Employed pay is almost negligible in differences. Slightly more for IC but definitely not worth it financially for the call. 2. Stemi call is stemi call. If you’re lucky to get in a big group of IC and do q6-8 stemi only call than sure it can be decent. But that’s the exception. 3. Job opportunities are plentiful either route.. maaaaaybe ic is more protected long term from ai and apps but I doubt it matters 4. 90% if my stress comes from procedures. To me I wouldn’t do it again. Harder to give it up in a certain sense but I’ll probably do that in the next 5 years
3. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=18, created=2025-05-22T22:18:41]: 1. Compensation will vary by group. In my group, we (IC) are paid a little more per RVU than our gen cards colleagues. However, this is not true in many (most?) groups. There are some (increasingly rare) situations where IC get paid lots more than gen cards...but that is not common at all. In general, a general cardiologist grinding through patients in clinic will earn more RVUs than an IC on a cath lab day...so they do have potential to earn more in many groups. 2. Depends on what you consider a decent lifestyle balance. I am on call Q5 and feel that lifestyle balance is okay. Have done call as frequently as Q2 before. I feel well with Q4 or less call, but become unhappy with anything more than that. Definitely easier to have more non-work life with general cardiology. 3. It is more difficult to find an IC job than it is to find a job in general cardiology. At my hospital, during the last 5 years, we have added 1 IC and 4 general cardiologists. My group is hiring a general cardiologist and we get about 2 ICs applying for every general cardiologist applying (we are not hiring IC now). However, there are still jobs available...you just have to put in a little more effort to find them. 4. No. I like IC a lot more than I thought I would. It is only 1 (okay...sometimes 2) extra year and it allows a huge diversification of practice. Doing procedures is fun, mixes up the day, gives me a way to interact with a different community (surgeons, cath lab staff, other ICs, etc.) and allows me to do things that make me fulfilled (treating a STEMI is something that you feel good about). However, I definitely CAN see myself giving up IC long before retirement age. When it comes to the IC job market, there is a paradox that you have to understand: There is a tradeoff between call burden and case volume. For many, the ideal "interventional career" is being able to show up at work at 7, do a few hours of interesting and meaningful interventional cases, and then go home without call most days. However, the main need for interventional cardiologists is to be available (on 24 hour call) for STEMIs. If you want to do cases all day, you will probably end up being on call all the time so you don't have to share case volume with others. If you want a lower call burden, you have to share case volume with more ICs. I had similar reservations to you. At the end of the day, I thought that one more year for IC was not much risk. I still agree with that. Even had I not worked in IC, I still would have been glad that I did that year. It was (oh so very) tiring, but it was super fulfilling and was the most fun year of all my training. My practice now is balanced: I take STEMI call Q5 and do a moderate number of cases otherwise. I do a lot of general cardiology. This has allowed me to live where I want to with acceptable income and work life balance. I don't "live in the cath lab" but I do enough cases to scratch the itch and I still get to go home at 5 most days.
4. u/redcartoon2 [score=11, created=2025-05-22T17:12:14]: I had the same dilemma with choosing EP. A couple of points. It really comes down to what gives you joy. If you don’t like Cath lab or think it’s not sustainable to be in Cath lab for your whole career then think twice. But if you truly love it then go for it. Everyone feels drained after first year of fellowship. So I think you will feel differently as an attending. I suggest to not think of salary and job opportunities at all as it changes by the time of your graduation. But on average it’s easier to find job as general cardiologist and you make 10-20% higher as interventionist.
5. u/Shad0wM0535 [score=8, created=2025-05-22T17:55:06]: We’ve had several docs in their mid careers drop IC for non-invasive over the years due to stress and physical issues from wearing lead. The high call burden that can be Q4-Q5 and can get to 15 weekends if other docs leave/retire/go out on medical leave can really wear at them. I veered toward imaging and HF early and I don’t envy my IC colleagues one bit. In a productivity model you can definitely make more but it’s not easy money — our young guys are working 6a-10p most nights to make a good seven figure salary, but the older docs that chose that path look 15 years older than their actual age and don’t have the best marital track record. You can make a high six figure salary as a non-invasive and I do, but some of that is luck of the draw depending on your community and $/RVU rates. Just my anecdotal experience.
6. u/Intelligent_Year3975 [score=7, created=2025-05-22T17:29:48]: Just in general fellowship still but 2 thoughts are: 1. Watching the interventional fellow do PCI when STEMI rolls in and save someone’s life was pretty effing cool - haven’t seen that kind of impact in many other places in medicine 2. You can always scale back but its hard to do IC fellowship midway through your career if you regret not doing it
7. u/tchocktchock [score=7, created=2025-05-22T22:15:50]: Did IC for 4 years. Lost the excitement pretty quickly. Your ability to absorb the stress and survive sleepless nights will start fading by 35-40. Got back to multimodal imaging, cardio oncology and considering getting into preventive precision cardiology.
8. u/zeey1 [score=6, created=2025-05-22T17:40:35]: Interventional cardiology has shitty job opportunities in major cities or towns In middle of no where its very rewarding So id you are going to go in middle of nowhere then do it or if you love it as love is blind Govt has ensured to screw Interventional procedures a cath is leas reimbursed then doing a local vein ablation or injections which are done by quacks all over the country
9. u/Hypochondriac_317 [score=6, created=2025-05-22T18:34:50]: I'm in the same boat. I love procedures and wouldn't mind being called at 3 am to save a life. But I'm not sure if i can live and die in the cath lab. I'd definitely want it to be 30% interventional, 70% general.
10. u/Feeling_Law7591 [score=5, created=2025-05-23T04:26:54]: I think this decision really depends on where you want to practice. I’m an interventional cardiologist, and I’ve worked in a rural hospital with no surgical back up as well as a major metropolitan hospital. Both can be very busy at times, but I have been able to go home most times at 5 PM from both places. I have found that pay for an interventionist has been higher than non-interventionalists, but based on other comments in this thread, it sounds like that can vary substantially. Personally, I can’t imagine not doing intervention. I am 48 years old now, so coming in at 2 AM for an emergency is not exactly the most fun and it takes a couple of days for me to fully recover now. But I would say late night emergencies is not common. I don’t mean to offend anyone, but I don’t think in interventional cardiologists should treat interventional cardiology like a hobby. This field is only getting more complex and it requires a lot of CME on new techniques and a willingness to continue to learn how to do these new techniques. I learned how to do CTO PCI, ECMO, Bipella, etc. all after my official fellowship training and this has helped me immensely in my everyday interventional practice, even when these high-level things aren’t required. If you are in an emotional place where you’re not sure you want to do interventional cardiology, I would not recommend that you do it. Again, this is my own personal feeling, and I don’t mean to seem condescending to others that want to be a part-time interventionist.
11. u/T3HasRisen [score=5, created=2025-05-22T19:12:48]: You’re thinking too much about money and job opportunities (you only need one). You better like dealing with non-cardiac chest pain and SOB in gen cards. I like to be solving problems. Find your passion.
12. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-05-23T08:45:27]: I wouldn't worry about opportunity cost. It's all rather moot after a lifetime of earnings either way. I wouldn't sweat the money part overall, you'll be making good money either direction. You just have to figure out what you want to do and how you want to practice. And you might not know until you actually start practicing. There's nothing wrong with doing that extra year then pivoting to gen cards, immediately or down the road. You may very well feel regret not doing that extra year. Or not. Maybe just a year will scratch that itch and you'll be ready for gen cards right away. Or an excellent gen cards opportunity might come up in your job search. Or maybe even your dream IC job. It doesn't hurt to keep your options open for now.
13. u/Gijon007 [score=2, created=2025-06-06T15:10:37]: I’ve been a noninvasive cardiologist for 35 years. I find variety is the key. I read echoes do TEE read nukes do hospital consult. See office clinic patients teach do clinical research and have administrative leadership duties. I would not do just clinic or just hospital for lack of variety. Having said all that seeing how EP has grown and the variety in that field, if I had to do all over again, would probably pursue that pathway. If you’re unsure get the extra training because once you’re established, it’s harder to go back . Good luck!
14. u/kgeurink [score=3, created=2025-05-23T10:00:34]: 1st year ic here. I can say it's amazing. Compared to my non invasive colleagues I make more money and my work life balance is excellent. This is very job dependent. I have 3 months vacation. You have to know yourself though. I do no general cardiology besides one day a week of clinic, if I had to do gen cards all day I would go insane. I have 4 days a week in the lab and I can see myself doing this for decades. If you're having doubts you probably don't love it. If you can imagine doing something else you probably should.
15. u/yangerang55 [score=3, created=2025-05-22T17:21:00]: I’m also thinking about this and ultimately am deciding IC. As with all specialties, pay and popularity rotate based on the decade so it’s hard to say what the pay still be like in 10 years. Gen cards is hot right now bc they are the referral hubs for everything else. I am choosing IC bc I love the cath lab and how comprehensive I can be. I don’t plan on doing 5 days in the lab and there are hardly any jobs like that now. Instead, I’m envisioning ~3 days, 2 days clinic, and some inpatient time whether that be CCU or Gen cards. Maybe a bit of TTE time if needed. I get to see and treat my patients throughout the process which I think is nice. More experienced people please feel free to correct me and tell me if this isn’t possible.
16. u/Austros_QRS [score=2, created=2025-05-22T18:23:07]: Wow, I came in to see what kind of recommendations, and honestly, they're all horrible! (But I think they're absolutely right.) I'm not really an IC, but I'm facing the same dilemmas than you I think if you're questioning the IC life in your first year, I think you should rethink everything. For me, it was easy to rule out an IC; I didn't want to get calls at 3 am lol Obviously (since you're asking about salary), I think those who have the most job opportunities are those who can diversify their work. I don't know how wide a range of possibilities there are for an IC outside of the operating room (although of course it depends on your team), but you can always find new sources of work
17. u/Haunting_Badger_862 [score=1, created=2025-05-23T14:37:51]: Thank you to everyone for your insight. Definitely helpful as many of my colleagues and friends are going EP.
18. u/leonidasturtle [score=1, created=2025-05-25T06:47:06]: If you like the critical portions of cards you should consider cardiac critical care. I do it and I love it.
