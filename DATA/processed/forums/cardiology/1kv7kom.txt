===============================================================================

Hey all, thanks for the collective insight. Thinking about careers in addition to IC and wondering what people’s experiences are. **IC + critical care**: My understanding here is that cardiac critical care specialists are increasing in need/want. General cardiologists “typically” don’t like their CCU time and being on call for sick patients. CCU patients are becoming more complex with medical comorbidities too. I like the ccu and sick patients but debating whether it’s worth an extra year. * does this sound accurate? Is there an increased pay incentive for these positions? Do employers even care? Does it give me more job flexibility / employability? **IC + PAD:** Another area that’s hard to quantify its eventual need/want. PAD has overlap with IR and Vascular with their procedures so it’s hard to build a PAD practice. Not even sure employment wise whether it’s desirable. I also like the sick PE patients but again it would have to be hospital dependent. * any current attendings with experience here? It generally feels like there aren’t a lot of opportunities. Not sure if there will be a shift towards more IC based PE teams but it makes sense medically (to me at least) bc cardiology knows how to treat these patients.

The other 2 interventionalist who want to do more than just coronaries do A LOT of peripheral stuff and PFO/VSD closures. They'll also do thrombectomies for PEs and angiovacs for endocarditis. Biopsy for myocarditis and periocardiocentesis. Essentially the mop man for everything else. From my experience as a general fellow in the cath lab I would stay far away from peripheral cases. They are messy and super long usually 4-5 hours with increasingly small RVU reimbursements. It's just not worth it. You are better served see clinic patients in the same amount of time you do a leg or a renal artery de-nervevation. And the complications with these leg patients are non stop. Dissected iliac, ischemic leg, perf'ed renal artery. Shit is not worth it at all. Those same interventionalist also take turns rounding on our CCU. I would also advise to avoid this. They still have cases during their CCU week. Often times half assed rounding with the fellow in between cases, but most of the time post 6pm. They also are very unhelpful. Yes they can put in the balloon pump, impella but they don't know what to do trouble shooting wise on day 2 of impella placement when there's persistent low flow alarms. And god forbid something non cardiac goes wrong with the patient like they need to be intubated or have an infection, us the fellows are on our own. Our interventionalist don't even have TEE privileges at our hospital so if someone has suspected endocarditis the fellow has to find a cardiologist with privileges willing to help out. You need to do a devoted 1 year critical care fellowship if you want to do IC+CCU in order to learn the medicine critical care aspects. And even then, places are going to just dump more work on you. You're going to be rounding in the CCU while still having cases that week. It's unlikely you'll get an entire week off of the cath lab to just focus on the CCU. Peripheral cases are not even worth it IMO. Just advice as a general fellow but the way to go is coronaries, 2nd operator for structural cases and fill in the remaining time with general cardiology responsibilities such as clinic, echos and nucs. That is the best bang for your buck. Ensure you're making a good amount without a needless amount of stress.
2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=8, created=2025-05-25T11:30:50]: If you are doing IC, I don't think it is worth your time to do CC fellowship as well. There are very few places that require/expect CC training to attend on CCU and gen+IC fellowship will probably make you pretty comfortable with CCU. There are also regions (the West Coast) where cards-CC fellowship has not caught on and/or is seen as a negative thing. Adding peripheral to IC is great if those patients and cases interest you a lot. It may or may not help with productivity depending on how you choose your cases. You'll have to work out local scope/ownership with the IR and vascular guys in your area, but it is very doable (and you can do it with other without another fellowship after IC). I generally agree with what u/groovitude313 shares. When you add things on to a cardiology career, you have to make sure that you are doing it for a good reason. Starting an invasive program for PE sounds cool, but it probably means a lot more call (and call that a hospital is not likely to reimburse you for). Peripheral cases can be interesting but, unless you have a peripheral-enriched practice, it's hard to do them efficiently. Remember that productivity for sitting in clinic is fairly high...so adding extras on is typically something that you do because you enjoy it.
3. u/PS2020 [score=3, created=2025-05-25T10:20:18]: I don't think critical care cards pays more than non critical care cards, at least in my shop. Two attendings are IC + Crit Care Cards trained, two are "just" Crit Care Cards. The IC folks obviously spend time in the Cath lab, whereas the non IC folks do echoes. Everyone has clinic. The salaries I think are comparable to noninvasive (this is in academic though).
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2025-05-25T11:00:21]: As others have mentioned the reality is many start off with ambitions of all this stuff (myself included) but when reality hits it’s rarely ever worth it. PEs? Now on “PE call” and having to deal with sick patients, critical care docs, etc PAD? Vasculopaths with long procedures and a tom of poor outcomes and complications Honestly hardest part of PAD for myself was knowing how much time to devote to potential cases. As mentioned above you can generate a lot more rvus in clinic or with imaging. But to answer your question, PAD is an easy addition.
5. u/Welbinho [score=2, created=2025-05-25T12:27:01]: This depends on the culture of the place you are at. Lots of places don’t have a dedicated ccu. The extra year would be kind of a waste unless you can get yourself a job at an academic place or some of the larger pp places with a dedicated ccu. As far as pv + cors again depends on where you go. Some places ir or vascular have dibs on pv. I’ve gotten lucky I got a gig with a lot of general cards and multiple days in the lab every week. So I get cors/some structural and no pv (which I didn’t want anyway) What I will tell you this is: Do as many cors your interventional year as you can; and do enough pv to be facile if you get in trouble.
6. u/pills_here [score=2, created=2025-05-25T15:20:05]: Cards CC is mostly an academic entity. PAD is popular, but each center only needs one or two. The financial upside imo is from reading the studies, not necessarily doing the interventions. It helps that it makes sense to have the guy doing the procedures also read the ultrasounds.
7. u/docmahi [score=2, created=2025-05-25T16:30:50]: My practice is essentially half endovascular half coronary Coronary interventions nationally are pretty stale - I actually thing any young interventionalist coming out needs something else. For me I enjoy PE/DVT tremendously and I also enjoy some arterial work as well. Requires you to be able to work well with others and interface with referring providers and provide not just quality care but timely care as well. I also have a great working relationship with my vascular surgeon - if I’m not increasing his volume as well I feel like I’m doing something wrong. Last year we saw an overall increase in over 30% of endovascular volume with an actual drop in coronary volume of a few percent Long story short if you want to do IC I think being able to have endovascular skills is a great thing
8. u/Ok-Location134 [score=2, created=2025-05-27T14:41:00]: Having spent all 3 months of our youngest son's life in the PCICU/CCU, I can tell you that there is definitely a need for CCU cardiologists. You would be going into an area that has a huge need, and you are correct that these babies have complex anatomies and physiologies. If you enjoy the challenge and want to see how much your work means to the families, do it. We wouldn't have our son without the CCU physicians he's had. I can't speak to their salaries or anything else other than what I've seen as a parent, and I can tell you that I am thankful for every one of them and all the work they do. Best of luck to you in your career no matter what you decide to do, but I figured I'd share the impact you'd have on the patients and their families. Also, do you happen to know what Taussig Bing Anomaly is?
9. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2025-05-25T18:03:32]: The challenge with a career in IC is the senior folks are usually very territorial about structural work. So you have to be willing to move somewhere less desireable or put in many years in one center before you have the opportunity. Some ICs are comfortable 'just' doing coronaries. The IC + CC is a pathway but what I've seen usually is HF/CC or just anesthesia/pulm intensivists running ICUs.
10. u/Greenheartdoc29 [score=1, created=2025-05-26T10:09:08]: Do what you like and are good at. You’re overthinking it
11. u/leonidasturtle [score=1, created=2025-05-29T03:32:41]: I am a critical care cardiologist. I love it. Definitely at least one extra year of training but worth it. I’m not sure if it makes too much sense with IC but it’s worth considering. I do not think adding critical care to IC will necessarily increase your pay. However, critical care Cardiology is in need and is it a growing field. Community is still small and most of us know each other. I would probably not have a problem, finding a job in most of the country. I don’t know, though that adding IC will increase or decrease employability. I’ve also noticed that most general cardiologists are trying to get out of the ICU/CCU.
12. u/Smooth_Assistance339 [score=1, created=2025-07-23T17:20:09]: Those who applied for interventional cardiology. Are you guys getting interviews?
13. u/spicypac [score=1, created=2025-05-25T11:20:53]: Just a PA here: One of my attendings did additional training on peripheral stuff in his IC fellowship so he likes “to do anything involving the pipes.” But you might be stepping on vascular’s and IR’s toes depending on your hospitals dynamic. As others have said, PAD pts get dicey. My other attending says that the peripheral pipes are easier to navigate since they’re so much bigger than coronaries, but when shit goes south it goes SOUTH 😅
14. u/Mysterious_Job_8251 [score=0, created=2025-05-25T10:30:00]: I’m just a PA but one of my attendings did IC and vascular including PEs and loves it. I think this would be most feasible in a smaller hospital where vascular specialty or IR is not as readily available so no turf issues. It was really nice to be able to manage the patient’s overall cardiovascular picture and we had an accredited vascular lab in clinic. If you want his number, I’m happy to connect.
15. u/cardsguy2018 [score=0, created=2025-05-28T10:38:37]: Don't waste your time on CCU. No one likes CCU. It seems fun and exciting in training but it gets old quick. And there's no incentive either. It will be difficult to find the right job too. Same for PAD, in my area it's all vascular and that's perfectly fine with me.
