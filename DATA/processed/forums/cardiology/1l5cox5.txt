===============================================================================

Pgy1 here hoping to pursue cardiology. Specifically drawn to it because of the procedural + interventional component… since first day in the cath lab as a student and I was hooked. Recent years have seen a shift in the interventional landscape. More stringent tightening of indications for revascularisation/stents particularly in stable angina, improvements in cardiac CT potentially reducing volume of diagnostic caths etc. I understand structural has a bright future but there doesn’t seem to be enough volume to go around anyway. Either way everything seems to be pointing to less time in the Cath lab, with a greater emphasis on non-invasive imaging, emerging medical therapeis, clinic etc. What are your thoughts on where all this will take interventional cardiology in the future? Specifically, do you think the average interventionalist will get less and less procedural as volume declines and there’s less work to go around? I know it’s impossible be definitive, but just seeking opinions on where the field seems to be heading (Had posted on r/residency but was advised would be better to post here :)) EDIT: thanks all for the replies. I should add I’m an Aussie pgy1, compensation is a little different to you guys. Not much money in STEMI call down here. Our reimbursements mainly come from elective caths (stents + diagnostic) in the private system. Because of this our interventionalists who have long elective lists also earn significantly more than non-procedural counterparts. If based on the comments, elective caths will largely disappear with only STEMI call left, not a good sign for us down under

Sure we have an aging population but medical therapy has gotten so good we are going to see a decline in PCI work, nonetheless. Additionally, reimbursements just aren't keeping up with inflation. But ultimately do what you enjoy and the money will follow
2. u/haripj99 [score=23, created=2025-06-07T04:38:13]: Some of our fellows who were all about doing IC decided to do noninvasive cardiology by their 3rd year of general cardiology. Mainly because the pay is about the same for a much better lifestyle. They also have families and spending possibly 2 more years in training didn't seem like a good idea. I myself am an EP and constantly fighting burnout but not because of the work - I love EP - but mostly because of where our healthcare system is going. The ranks of admins are growing rapidly and a lot of money being spent in their salaries and benefits. They in turn have to justify their existence so come up with new "metrics" that add more non medical work and pressure on physicians. I agree with others that STEMI call will always be needed so there will always be jobs. I think after 15 or so years in practice it gets quite old being on q3 or q4 call even if you don't get called in. If you have family or plan to have one please keep in mind that the quality of life will be gained from spending time with your family and not from spending time on the job or on call.
3. u/ChinitoIncognito [score=18, created=2025-06-07T03:16:47]: Honestly, the future does not look great in my opinion. Trials like COURAGE, ISCHEMIA, BCIS-REVIVED have shown that medical management of stable CAD is non-inferior to an invasive strategy. For this reason, a lot of patients are not even coming to the cath lab anymore. Their general cardiologists are “medically managing” their obstructive CAD which is diagnosed by non-invasive methods (i.e., stress treating or coronary CTA). With everyone on statins, incidence of ACS is declining. The patients that do finally show up to the cath lab are often 80+ years old and have a million co-morbidities and horrible, calcified multivesssel CAD that the surgeons will not touch. Then you find yourself discussing either high risk PCI or hospice. Like you alluded to, there is not enough structural volume to go around. Structural fellowships are going unfilled for this reason. If you can get peripheral trained and find a gig that allows you to do peripheral work, this will augment your case volume. However, prepare to move somewhere relatively remote (i.e., not near a big city) if you want to do this because in most major hospitals vascular surgery/IR does all of the peripheral work. With catheter-based therapies for acute PE and renal denervation gaining momentum (mostly from device company propaganda), there is some hope that these procedures will increase volume. But overall, the volume (and pay) is nothing like what it was say 20 years ago. I think there will always be a job market (again, perhaps more so in less desirable geographical locations) because despite declining numbers, STEMIs will still occasionally happen, and STEMI capable hospitals will always need ICs to take call. However, a lot of jobs out there basically have you work as a general cardiologist that takes STEMI call. In summary, I hope I am wrong, but I do not think the future looks good for the field.
4. u/saynocpr [score=16, created=2025-06-07T11:15:34]: Practicing IC, program director here. This seems to be a recurring question and I am going to give it a go. While regional variations exist, some of the other comments seem generalizations, well intended but do not seem to reflect what we and colleagues in other places are currently seeing. My impression in no particular order: \- No cardiology field is being compensated as it was 20 yrs ago. \- Do NOT do IC for the money. Having said that, it still it being paid more than gen cards. Depending on the practice model, a lot more. This may not apply to you ‘down under’, but for the US, you may google MedAxiom to give you an idea \- Almost by definition, call frequency will be more as a practice is likely to have a base of gen card APPs and MDs and subspecialty smaller group of IC and EP docs. On the other hand, as there is a shortage of IC, STEMI call only is relatively common. \- I would \*personally\* much rather be on call for STEMI than for gen card. Yes, it is more life disruptive but after &gt;10 yrs of practice I still enjoy the thrill of the acuity of cases, the challenge of the unexpected, the incredible enjoinment that comes from using your skills to literally defeat death and see the results right there and then. Few specialties offer the satisfaction, immediacy, and rewards (but also the stakes and risks) that IC does. \- Many IC docs retired during COVID and the current graduate output has been unable to meet demand. We are a collegial in a large very desirable metro area, offering above average initial guaranteed compensation for 2 yrs, very little turnover and are having a challenge recruiting a good IC for an open spot. \- The structural field is not what it was and there seems to be saturation. That is likely a function of how popular it has been last few yrs, that 1-2 structural docs can serve the needs of even a large group and that not every hospital is capable of having a structural dept. \- Vascular is in increasing demand as it does not require the investment that a structural program does and there continues to be a broadening of treatment areas, PE, DVTs, venous, renal denervation. \- As opposed to gen card there is (so far) less encroachment / replacement risk by AI and/or APPs. \- The above applies to non-academic IC. I tried academia for a yr and that is another different beast. I am not sure I would recommend IC in an academic setting. In my brief experience, it seemed underpaid and overworked and having fellows did not lessen the burden as I still needed to be directly involved. Plus the pressures of publication, grants, etc. Ultimately, if you need to be convinced to do IC… don’t. Do what you love. I go to work feeling that they pay me to do what I love. Hope that helps and Godspeed on whatever you choose.
5. u/Docdad30 [score=31, created=2025-06-06T22:01:43]: I’m in the same boat here. Joined for the sexiness of IC and currently in the same stage trying to decide what my next move should be. I think no matter how far we get with medical therapies, aging and increasing number of comorbidities will continue to cause more coronary events and procedure volume is there to stay. Part of me believe it’s, it might even increase. Less and less people want to go into IC due to shitty lifestyle and older people will retire/hang their lead. Creating space for younger generation. Personally I’m looking into structural vs vascular as additive to myself more competitive, not sure if I will find a place that will offer me all that within that one year of training or not.
6. u/peeam [score=7, created=2025-06-07T08:46:56]: Elective caths will not die as long as the CT surgeons exist.
7. u/doc2025 [score=5, created=2025-06-06T23:08:47]: Key will be coronaries plus structural or coronaries plus vascular. More than enough volume when doing both.
8. u/Medical-Rooster8709 [score=4, created=2025-06-08T12:53:58]: You can make a very comfortable living = $500,000 a year as a noninvasive cardiologist, go home at 5 pm and be done. Weekends free or read a few echoes/EKGs remotely.
9. u/[deleted] [score=10, created=2025-06-07T06:54:47]: Fellow at big workhorse Philly program. 1. IC is saturated. The vast majority of IC jobs you will be doing a lot of general cardiology work and taking a lot of general cardiology call. That's on top of IC call/STEMI call. The IC grads this year at my program all had a difficult time finding a job in a location of their preference along with the job entailing what they wanted. All of them are doing general cardiology work on top of IC responsibilities. 2. Two-three full days in the lab is probably the best you're going to get. Our most senior and well known interventionalist at my program has 4 lab days split between peripherals, coronaries and structural. And one full clinic day. All the other IC guys have 2.5 lab days max. 3. Going back to saturated, big metropolitan areas will be saturated with IC. They will still work you for a lower salary for that area think NYC/SF/LA/Philly/. You'll likely have to read echos, nucs, general call and IC. 4. Structural is even more saturated. TAVR, TEER and TVVR are all still in their growing years. TAVR is the oldest and onyl about 15 years popular. All those attendings who were in training when TAVR came out are still practicing and in their primes. They do not want to give up these structural procedures which often have high RVUs. In order to do structural you'll have to go somewhere rural and build a program up yourself (and in turn overwork yourself), or be 2nd operator under someone who will allow you to build your base. And even then you may be 2nd operator for 10+ years before getting to run the show solo. 5. Ah you may then think you should diversify your skills with peripheral interventions, PFO/VSD closures, PE interventions etc. The RVUs for these procedures given their time, complexity and risks are not worth it IMO. It may be your niche if you truly LOVE interventional but it makes no economic sense. 6. Think of the effect on your body. Wearing lead so frequently. Numerous IC docs I know have back issues. I know some who have had back surgery, herniated disks, some with severe spinal issues they require fusion. 7. Think of the effects on your body taking STEMI call. No post call days for attendings. There's no other fellow to cover you if a STEMI one night turns into a complicated case requiring support. Your STEMI went from midnight to 5am? Well no sense in going back home, might as well start your day at the hospital or clinic when the case is done. Waking up all those nights, long hours will also take it's toll on your body. 7. Think about family. You want to miss your pee-wee kid's soccer final on the weekend because 92 year old mee-mawh had a STEMI and family wants everything done? Your daughter's violin recital on a Wednesday night because the left main you thought didn't need support is crashing and needed an emergent balloon pump? You and your spouse haven't been able to take a good long vacation in years because you're need for STEMI call and no one else can cover? 8. More and more studies are showing we don't need to stent every lesion. Outside of STEMI, nothing needs to immediately be stented. Even NSTEMI you can medically manage for 48 hours and bring them back later. Stable CAD is a no-no. No benefit in CTO lesions other than a 4 hour time sink for penny's for RVUs. If there's anymore I can think of I'll edit the post. Again, I'm just a fellow, but I have seen the IC attendings and fellows work at my program. All of our IC fellows have told me they regretted IC after the year of fellowship. They just fell in love with the instantaneous adrenaline rush of access, engaging, crossing the lesion, ballooning, stenting, ballooning and that TIMI III flow. They didn't think of how it would be day after day of this. All of them struggled to find jobs and had to give up something (location, salary, scope). Don't get me wrong. From 8am to about 3pm on a M-F I love the cath lab. It's fun to get access, if you have a good cath lab nursing staff with music and food on friday's it's a good time. The first time as a first year the attending let me deploy that stent and i saw that "chefs kiss" TIMI III flow when I cine'd it was a rush like I've never felt before. But I've dealt with enough 3am middle of the night STEMIs, activating the lab, getting the patient on the table and then 4-5 hours of mechanical support, difficult lesions to cross, dissected arteries etc for me to say "yup not for me". Think long and hard about IC. The only two interventional fellows that I've met on my journey who truly love it live, breathe and sleep IC. They would rather be in the cath lab than on a beach in Hawaii. Rather be in the cath lab than at their mother's birthday dinner. The cath lab fulfills something for them nothing else does. And even then, I've seen them on tough days regretting the decision.
10. u/popolijt [score=3, created=2025-06-07T05:20:50]: If you like the cath lab, do it. Trust me you will regret if you don’t and you really like it like you say. forget about all the other stuff, if you really enjoy it, do it. Worst is sitting reading echos knowing you could be doing what you really enjoy.
11. u/jiklkfd578 [score=7, created=2025-06-07T04:24:18]: There’s not a field in medicine more protected than IC. Don’t get me wrong IC sucks and I think it’s ridiculous to purposely chose a specialty that will take years off your life but it’s silly to think your skill set isn’t as protected as any future physician. The leading cause of death in an aging population and you have the one skill set that no other physician, midlevel or AI has to deal with that. Volumes go down but your demand for ACS care never will.. and will only increase especially since future generations will quit at much higher rates than the IC cowboys of old and no one else is willing or capable to do one of the worst jobs in medicine in re: to call/lifestyle, risk, etc.
12. u/steep_learning_curve [score=5, created=2025-06-06T21:58:50]: That will make STEMI call super chill and ICs will just rake in money while sleeping. Win if it happens, Win if it doesn't happen.
13. u/Extra_Currency1511 [score=2, created=2025-06-07T21:05:23]: So I’m an interventionalist, who learned to do legs a bit in fellowship, but really learned my first 2 years in practice. Nobody was wanting to do them, so my leg practice got huge. My group was able to start an OBL and financially this was the best part of my career. I was the president of the OBL and the group after the original guy retired. We each had a day in the OBL and my salary doubled. I made more money doing legs for 4 hours on a Tuesday than everything else combined. And I’m nuke and echo boarded as well, which I would recommend in your training. General cardiology fellowship is where I got these obviously. Then the hospital hires a vascular surgeon who was just going to be a surgeon (not gonna do percutaneous stuff) but that’s not how it went down. They also purchased the surgical group (wound care) and some of the podiatrist groups. They seemed to have mandated that all referrals go to her the vascular surgeon, and volumes went way down. I stayed full, doing 4-5 outpatient cases a week, but everyone else dried up. We split things 60/40, meaning in the OBL 40 goes to the operator 60 to the group. So I’m basically paying their overhead, which is frustrating.. Fast forward we started working with a PE group and were going to move forward, would have been very nice on the front end. And they were going to ensure we got an ASC, which is hard in my state, and PET/CT, which would have been great. My one partner tanked the deal, and we ended up doing a deal with the hospital, not my first choice. My starting salary is nice, but there’s a big possibility for RVU bonus (theoretically, hasn’t happened yet.) The reason for the shift was increased overhead and decreased reimbursement every year. It just wasn’t sustainable. In the OBL during the good days, my charges averaged 120k for just 4-5 cases. Sometimes as much as 200k. (This is not collections but charges). But that’s gotten near impossible with Humana and United health rejecting everything especially btk stuff with nonhealing wounds. So moving forward, there’s no real difference between the OBL and the Cath lab, financially speaking. I try to keep simple cases in the OBL, because patients prefer it, but even complex cases seem to go better there, because we have the best techs and up until now paid them very well. The hospital will dictate that now. I have regrets every day, but this is just one ICs story. I’ve gotten offers do just do 100% outpatient legs in various OBLs for 900k, and I turned them down. I don’t want to stop doing hearts, though legs are my passion. In 3-4 months I’ll know how good or bad of a decision this was. Oh and 3/7 of my partners quit, moved, or retired during this time. I had said I’d never work for a hospital, but here I am. In reality, there’s unlimited work here and I can be as busy as I want to be. The volume is not necessarily going down if you’re nice to referring docs and not an asshole. I know this is not true in big cities, and I’m in a fairly big college town. But nothing like an actual big city. I’ve been out of IC fellowship almost 11 years. And obviously I went straight through, so I’m mid 40s.
14. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-06-08T09:14:22]: It'll mostly stay the same for awhile. People really tend to exaggerate these timelines and changes. Things move slowly in medicine. Cardiac CT was being discussed back when I was in med school 15+yrs ago. Plenty doctors still practice like it's the 90's without issue. Ultimately though if you're interested in IC, just do it. But for now keep an open mind.
15. u/tchocktchock [score=4, created=2025-06-06T23:15:31]: The true future is preventive and personalized cardiology. Identify at a young age patients at risk of developing AS or CAD and treat them with targeted pharmacological treatments. IC would then disappear. This is a bit provocative…but we are fast approaching
16. u/creamasteric_reflex [score=1, created=2025-06-07T07:05:03]: I’d say only do it if you live cardiology. Yeah procedures are going down because of good medical therapy but you will stay busy with plenty of clinic. If your wanting to make $1mil+ it’s harder to do so only do it you truly love cardiology
17. u/spicypac [score=1, created=2025-06-07T09:37:50]: Only a cardiology PA here but I work most closely with the IC: I’m at a mid size hospital outside of the big city with a big service area. IC is swamped here. But in the big and mid size cities there’s a lot less volume cause more hospital density. The docs’ call schedule is awful and if you don’t love it you’ll be miserable. Even though guidelines really favor medical management and prevention, the pervasive anti-statin/medication movement is gonna keep the IC business going more than we might expect (kind of joking, but kind of not haha).
18. u/Greenheartdoc29 [score=1, created=2025-06-07T10:23:09]: The main innovations today are in imaging and structural. Coronary pci is a commodity but a lucrative one, and you’re helping people. You choose which you find of most interest to you.

20. u/IdeaRevolutionary632 [score=1, created=2025-10-08T21:20:54]: Interventional cardiology is shifting, but not disappearing. Elective stenting for stable angina is declining with stronger evidence for medical therapy and better imaging, so diagnostic and elective cath volumes will likely drop. That said, STEMI, high-risk PCI, and especially structural interventions (TAVR, MitraClip, left atrial appendage occlusion) are expanding and will anchor the field’s future. So yes average interventionalists may do fewer routine cases, but those who adapt by embracing structural, complex coronary, and hybrid imaging–procedural roles will remain in demand.
