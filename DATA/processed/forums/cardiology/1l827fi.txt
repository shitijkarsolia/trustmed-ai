2. u/BadonkaDonkies [score=11, created=2025-06-10T10:00:24]: Just go in with basics of EKGs. Rough idea of echos atleast try to familiarize yourself with the basic views if able. Know the basics of ACS and HF. You'll learn the rest as you progress throughout

Have a good attitude, look things up when you don’t know, and don’t be lazy while working. Essentially the same as being a good IM resident. Agree with everyone saying to know basics of EKG, basic echo views, general management of ACS/HF. Best way to do the latter things is try to learn everything well when studying for ABIM boards to have a decent foundation When you’re actually on your cath rotation, watch some basic videos explaining the steps before scrubbing in(Look up Manos Brilakis on YouTube). The rest you’ll be taught. If you’re not sure about something and have time, use the ACC/AHA guidelines as a reference. When you have downtime in fellowship, ACCSAP questions and/or videos (or Mayo videos) are a good resource.
