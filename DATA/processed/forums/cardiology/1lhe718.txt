What actually happens hemodynamically immediately after VSD is closed that can cause immediate LV or RV or combined failure? Any references?

The right ventricle is a lower pressure chamber and with flow. There is a higher amount of flow into the lung circulation which distends the pulmonary arteries and can lead to pulmonary hypertension over time. If significant pulmonary hypertension has developed, closing the VSD can lead to RV failure. The left ventricle has the “option” of pumping blood against aortic pressure or against a lower right ventricular pressure with an open VSD. This means more volume is required to maintain forward LV stroke volume. At the time of VSD closure, LV function can get temporarily worse given the loss of the low pressure RV outlet but over time the function improves as positive remodeling happens with less preload and LV distension. Hemodynamically, acute VSDs should be closed as soon as possible, unfortunately, in certain situations like post-MI, the tissue is friable and the size of the hole isn’t clear yet, so patching early is often ineffective.
2. u/astrofuzzics [score=7, created=2025-06-22T12:04:29]: We see VSRs all the time. At the risk of being pedantic, it is a VSR (ventricular septal rupture), not a VSD (ventricular septal defect, which is congenital). The presentation can be variable depending on the size of the VSR and what else is going on with the patient (e.g. whether they have concomitant LV failure, ischemic MR, or something else). But often the presentation is sudden onset shock - evidence of poor perfusion, lactic acidosis, acute kidney/liver injury, delirium, weak pulses, skin mottling, etc. The LV’s output is going to the RV instead of into the aorta. Often these patients get pulmonary artery catheters placed for monitoring. Sometimes the PA catheter is already in place when the VSR happens. Don’t fall into the pitfall of misinterpreting a high mixed venous as evidence of distributive/septic shock - it reflects L to R shunting in these cases. In terms of management, definitive treatment consists of closing the VSR. However, sewing a patch into acutely infarcted myocardium is very tricky - one of the surgeons I work with describes it as “trying to stitch into hamburger meat.” Retrospective studies show that people who are taken to the OR 5-10 days after their VSR tend to do better than the ones taken immediately. These data are obviously full of confounds (maybe the ones taken immediately were sicker to begin with?) but the idea still impacts practice. Some of these patients actually have a normal blood pressure, and we can stabilize them by giving afterload reduction to the LV (we often use sodium nitroprusside), which lowers the shunt fraction. However, many patients with a VSR are hypotensive. For the hypotensive patients with VSR, we often place an Impella 5.5, which pulls the blood from the left ventricle into the aorta instead of letting it go into the right ventricle. That helps restore some hemodynamics and buy time for the patient’s infarct to finish scarring, at which point it is more technically feasible to repair the rupture with a patch. Of course Impella’s come with their own host of complications, but that’s a totally different topic. My personal experience with trying to close these things percutaneously is that plugs don’t work very well - there’s always a little leak, which has a high velocity due to the pressure differential between the LV and the RV cavities, and then patients develop hemolysis and all kinds of issues. The unfortunate truth is that many of these people still die, whether they get surgery or not - recall that, globally, the mortality from acute MI with cardiogenic shock is still over 50%.

4. u/memezade [score=1, created=2025-06-21T22:47:40]: Surgery is the treatment of choice, but still mortality is very high. 50%.
5. u/heartplumber [score=1, created=2025-06-22T13:30:43]: Surgical closure is the standard of care for ischemic VSD patients. LV cavity size is altered, usually made smaller resulting in smaller stroke volume and hence LV failure. The patch can bulge towards RV decreasing RV stroke volume as well if it is a big defect with a big patch.
