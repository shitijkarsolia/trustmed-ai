2. u/cardsguy2018 [score=5, created=2025-06-29T08:34:21]: Neither. Gen cards is where it's at.
3. u/br0mer [score=8, created=2025-06-29T07:25:10]: Never wanted to do IC but contemplated advanced chf but didn't pursue it. I help with our service cuz we are down a doc, we do a handful of transplants (&lt;10) and like 10-20 VADs. Advanced heart failure is mostly bullshit. GDMT is so good that most heart failure is essentially curable today. Transplant/VAD numbers are flat. There really isn't a huge population of advanced CHF and most patients with advanced CHF are elderly anyways. There's not really an epidemic of heart failure out there. If you look at the numbers beyond the headlines, ICD deaths are down, pump failure deaths are down, so exactly how are these patients dying? It's from other causes, which obviously CHF makes worse, but transplant/vad won't make them better. The best data that demonstrates heart failure is bullshit, IMO, is ROADMAP. Advanced CHF but class 3b, not 4, in the heartmate 2, and there was no mortality benefit. So if treating these fairly advanced, fairly symptomatic patients with advanced therapies doesn't result in a mortality benefit, it shows actually how benign a disease like CHF is. And this is before our current modern therapy, you could argue that ROADMAP today would find harm, as GDMT is better but the device isn't that much better, though CHF docs like to taut it is. MOMENTUM 3 demonstrated less pump thrombosis, but similar rates of bleed, stroke, infection, etc, and no mortality benefit. If you ran ROADMAP today, it'd be a trial that finds harm instead given how much better GDMT is today vs in early 2000s. Finally, you limit yourself to mostly academic centers if you want the full spectrum of CHF. That's a 50% paycut. You can't pay your bills in prestige. I made partner this year in our group, and it's like 750k plus rvu bonuses plus quality bonuses. Not unusual to make a million if you hustle, and most docs make 800k in our group.
4. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2025-06-29T18:08:26]: Depends on what you like and what you want Very different fields
5. u/Doc-Emo [score=2, created=2025-07-19T11:32:05]: I’m doing both lol ask me in a few years. I will say that doing AHFT prior to IC fellowship has helped me in terms of management of acute patients and selection of tMCS.
6. u/cardiodevil_92 [score=1, created=2025-06-29T06:02:25]: IC.
7. u/noltey22 [score=1, created=2025-06-29T06:09:10]: Depends on whether you value doing procedures versus having long term relationships with patients.
8. u/supadupasid [score=1, created=2025-08-08T20:46:49]: Ic probably. But general cards is more money for hours worked.
