===============================================================================

How are we feeling, new fellows? Excited? A bit nervous? Maybe somewhere in between? There are plenty of great threads here about study tips and resources, but I wanted to ask from a slightly different angle. For those who have recently graduated or are further along — what are three key pieces of advice or lessons you either received or wish you had when you were starting fellowship? Whether it’s about managing time, balancing responsibilities, mainitning hobbies/fitness, navigating the learning curve, or anything else that helped you along the way. Looking forward to officially starting this journey and joining the best specialty. Appreciate any thoughts you’re willing to share. Thanks all!

Don’t worry about impressing people, being the best in your cohort, never looking the fool, etc. You will never have another time in your life where you will have access to so much clinical learning nor will you ever have another time where the opportunity cost of learning is so low. Take advantage of it. Don’t just learn the thought process of managing patients (which is extremely important and valuable in its own right), but also specific skills (TEE, nuclear, cath, interventions, etc.). This isn’t just for “the love of learning”: These things all have potential to make your patients healthier, your professional life more fulfilling, your schedule easier and your bank account larger. That being said, I also think it is important to continue to invest in your own health, relationships and spirituality. If you don’t have an exercise habit in fellowship, it’s harder to pick it up later on. Don’t fail your loved ones or abandon your faith. Obviously, that means you will give up *some* learning opportunities. Choose wisely. There is still plenty of time to have a great life in most fellowship programs. Just don’t waste time.

Be nice to cath staff, residents, hospitalists, echo tech, etc. There’s a big learning curve and everyone can teach you something. Be humble because you will be wrong many times and not be perfect at everything right out of the gate.

4. u/strikex2 [score=7, created=2025-07-01T21:49:36]: Remember to enjoy the journey man. some of my clostest friends are my co-general and co-EP fellows. sometimes the calls are shit and you get frustrated for seeing another bs chest pain, HF or afib consult but remember how hard you worked to get to where you are and its a privilage. so enjoy it! my 8 years of training was over in a blink of an eye.
5. u/jiklkfd578 [score=3, created=2025-07-01T20:31:42]: 1. Don’t neglect your health as much as possible. 2. Exercise. 3. Get as many level 2 or billable skills as possible.
6. u/ArrivalJunior6438 [score=4, created=2025-07-02T16:13:24]: 1. Be nice to your CCU nurses/cath lab techs etc. they will make your life way easier. Dont argue with them. 2. You are a fellow now. Residents, nurses, and attendings from other specialties will now look up to you. Don’t be a dick. When they consult you, while it may seem like a simple chest pain consult, remember that they need help and usually there’s another cardiac problem the pt has that you can help with. Also remember this is how you will generate business/RVU’s in real practice. 3. Ask questions. You don’t understand why the EF was called X instead of Y on your TTE read? Ask. You don’t understand the cath anatomy? Ask. You’re there to learn. You are not expected to already have the knowledge base. These attendings have been doing this for years, ask them as many questions as you can before you go out into independent practice
7. u/KtoTheShow [score=4, created=2025-07-02T16:29:12]: 1. Ask questions. There are few dumb questions when fellowship is beginning. 2. Be kind to everyone - I received multiple recognitions in fellowship from both hospital staff and medical students because of my demeanor. 3. Fellowship is about #s and depth of exposure as much as it is about breadth. Residency you want to see one of everything but fellowship is about repetition (e.g. 100 TEE's) just as much as it is about the rare case (e.g. myxoma)
8. u/H_is_for_Human [score=5, created=2025-07-07T10:12:21]: Ask questions so you learn things. Don't try to be the cool or aloof fellow that thinks if they don't open their mouth they'll look smarter. Your reputation matters and precedes you. Don't trash talk anyone to anyone who might overhear or repeat it. Don't earn a reputation for being hard to reach or hard to work with. Keep your own procedure logs from the very beginning; people assume that just because "it's all in the computer" that it will be available or accessible to you when you need it at the time you are looking for jobs or trying to prove you hit COCATS level 2 in something. If you are going general cardiology it's a great idea to pick up imaging skills. Echo and nuclear at minimum but increasingly getting CT level 2 is going to open up a lot of jobs
9. u/cardsguy2018 [score=3, created=2025-07-02T08:54:40]: My best lessons came from my clinic attending, he was outstanding. Lessons on how to practice, manage your clinic, your patients, etc. And as always, be nice to people. People remember and they talk, doesn't matter where you are in the country.
