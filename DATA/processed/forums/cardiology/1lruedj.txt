I did pretty well at the practice sessions for those, but the exam on day 2 was tough. Day one is long but fair. Do not underestimate day 2.
2. u/KtoTheShow [score=5, created=2025-07-04T14:58:06]: Probably good enough to pass. I would keep reviewing MayoSAP or ACCSap as there isn't much else in terms of good review material
3. u/Hue_Honey [score=6, created=2025-07-05T20:59:30]: ECGsource
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2025-07-04T18:27:28]: Who knows. It’s pretty random.
5. u/Due_Efficiency_8664 [score=2, created=2025-07-04T21:32:10]: Where to find Mayo Videos?
6. u/IamZurg98 [score=2, created=2025-07-05T03:49:43]: I’m interested in the prep for that; which resources did u use for preparation?
7. u/rivaroxaban_ [score=2, created=2025-07-05T15:46:25]: How hard or easy is the board vitals compared to ACCSAP?
8. u/ichibanjay [score=2, created=2025-07-06T09:19:18]: Sounds like you are ok for day 1. Just remember, you just have to know the answer for half the questions on day 1, on the other half, as long as you can narrow the answer choices down to two, flip a coin and you’ll get half of those right which will give you about 75% correct to pass the day 1 boards. Highly recommend you get a subscription for ecgsource and do at least 2000 EKG’s and get at least 55% correct on the total average by the end. Gets you used to the grading sheet they use the on second day. Also make sure you do the echo and Cath sections on ecg source as they use the grading sheets for those as well.
9. u/Desperate-Stomach233 [score=1, created=2025-07-13T18:10:29]: Does anyone know if the coding used in O'Keefe is better or ECGsource? What's more like the exam?
10. u/Popular_Jeweler [score=1, created=2025-07-16T05:56:07]: The scores are good. But the theory is not the problem, the proble is that effin day 2 and their scoring sheets. That's where they get ya.
11. u/LateGadolinium [score=1, created=2025-08-25T14:55:43]: Anyone that has done board vitals is it worth spending the time doing it? Also acc ecg drill?
