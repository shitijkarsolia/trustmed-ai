===============================================================================

Hi all - I have been a PA-C for almost 4 years, three of those being in the ED &amp; I am coming up on one year in cardiology. I work closely with my supervising physician in a private practice setting &amp; overall we have a great working relationship. Coming up on my one year anniversary of being hired, I’m reflecting and working on a list of things I’d like to improve on. To all of the docs, what traits make a good cardiology physician assistant in your eyes? Are there any specific skills or behaviors that make you really appreciate the PAs that work with you? Alternatively, anything that drives you crazy? Thank you in advance

But I can tell you a few things that my doc greatly appreciates. - Giving report should be no more than a 30 second affair. Cut to the chase already, nobody cares about the patient's dog or exactly which restaurant they started having chest pain at. Keep it clean, keep it simple - Take as much off of his or her plate as possible. At the end of the day, our role is to extend the amount of work they're able to shoulder by cutting back on the busywork. Pick the low-hanging fruit. Interpret the labs, read the holter/ambulatory monitor reports, check the inboxes for stupid stuff, direct the staff to refill maintenance meds and whatnot. Leave your number with the nurses at the hospitals you consult at and encourage them to call you directly instead of reaching out to your SP, especially during clinic hours. Nothing aggravates my doc more than getting trivial questions or notifications that somebody else can handle. Triage that junk and only escalate the stuff that really needs physician attention. - Know the guidelines inside and out. You're a year in now, your doc is going to expect you to be able to manage most things yourself. Consider sitting for the CCKE. Stay up to date on changes in practice. Being able to stand on your own two feet comes with time and experience, but you should be mostly independent when it comes to the day to day grind by now. But, don't be afraid to ask questions either. Just make sure you've exhausted your learning resources before you do. - Speaking of asking for help, come to your SP with plans and solutions, not problems. You're asking for assistance with your medical decision making, not completely offloading it. Approach with a format of "I have X patient with Y problem, I'm thinking I could do Z but I wanted to seek your input before I do." This one goes a long way in my experience. - This may be extra and some would disagree, but try to have some understanding of what goes on with their schedule, even outside of work. If I know my SP has a jam-packed day of TEEs or whatever, I'll proactively round on the hospitalized folks even if he doesn't directly ask me to. If it's his wife's birthday and he's taking her out to dinner, I'm damn sure gonna have him out of the office by 5. That last patient was running late and it's gonna make him late for a special occasion? Get out of here dude, I got this (to be fair, he does this for me too).
