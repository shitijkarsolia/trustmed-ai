===============================================================================

I am a long time acute care physical therapist. In previous hospitals I have worked in our department has typically seen these patients when 1) The diagnosis of IE has been made 2) Infectious disease started IV antibiotics and 3) cardiology and CVS has weighed in also and patient is hemodynamically stable and needs PT for recommendations and address mobility concerns becomes a priority . OR patient has completed all IV therapy outside of the hospital and returns for definitive surgical management and we see them post -op. When I have seen acute cases with emergent surgery they are a sick group and typically very weakened I know high mortality can be seen in IE. I also know it can be muddy getting to the diagnoses (Maybe I am wrong about this) Here is my concern about care of these patients and how they are managed and my role as a PT in a hospital where we may get a PT order sooner than expected from my previous experience with this population. At anytime are these patients placed on bedrest with just bathroom privileges prior to definitive management? This is my example from a recent patient:. 50ish year old guy with no past medical history is diagnoses on admission with sepsis. So far EKG is only showing sinus tachy and BPs are stable and he is on room air. At this time much is unknown as ID work up goes. He is on IV antibiotics ( I do not what) Day 2 PT is ordered because he is weak. We see him and basic moving around in his room he doesn't need any help. We walk him in the hall and monitored vitals. persistently tachy and easily exhausted. Day 3 there is more concern for IE. Cardiology weighs in and echo showed decreased EF (35%) and concern for valve issues at aorta. It is on Day 3 that I see him. Previous days of walking with PT he declined in distance to about 25 ft, tachy and starting to get confused. More concern for IE and he tests positive for Lyme, blood culture done but no result. ID did not think Lyme was cause of endocarditis but certainly complicates his presentation. He is scheduled for TEE on the day I am to see him. I plan to see him much later after tests and sedation, with hopes I have the results. I am concerned about seeing this man. I go to his room to speak with him and his nurse in the room. He says strange things but is oriented. I ask him if feels OK and still feeling any effects of sedation from TEE. He is not sure. He is comfortable but resting at 120. Pallor. BP soft. Nurse is addressing. My gut was thinking something is just NOT right here. Nurse tells me he has been saying bizarre tangential things since the morning before TEE. He said his ankles are swollen because of his heart. He is on lasix. I decide to HOLD therapy due to increased confusion and persistent tachycardia and borderline BP and no results from TEE. I sent message to hospitalist if this is IE can I safely work with him with suboptimal stability with IE. It was end of day. I did not here back. I document the visit and plan for next PT visit to monitoring very closely and consider HOLD PT until clarification. Later I see the results of TEE suggesting mobile masses on 3 valves: Tricuspid, mitral, Aorta with severe stenosis and largest mass and moderately severe mitral valve regurgitation.(No known previous heart studies). This is a weekend. So not sure if the timing of the consult. Does 3 valve involvement change the algorithm for treating or ambulating this patient? Is multi valve IE common? Should mobility be restricted at anytime during this work up? I return to my regular position in ICU. He was transferred down the evening before for closer monitoring, pressor support and 2 L O2. He was seen by PT both days I was gone and more confusion, not able to do much and PT stopped the session almost immediately and communicated this to RN. The medical team wanted him to continue PT apparently. I am to just check on him in ICU by talking to RN for clarity. Patient is alert and moving about in room with staff. CVS is now consulting (Day 7) and considering emergent surgery. My plan was to HOLD therapy indefinitely and inform team why. He goes into respiratory and then cardiac arrest and dies about 5 minutes after I arrive on the unit (it was a very long Code) . I was just about to speak to his nurse to check on him. CVS had just finished their consult in wee am hours and were planning for surgery the same day. Again in previous acute settings PT is not seeing these patients typically until there is a clear treatment plan. It would have been my plan to hold all therapy until we are needed. We stopped mobility with ANY signs of intolerance. I do not feel that PT was truly indicated at this time in his admission. I do appreciate the seriousness of this condition. If folks can point me to resources on the acute management of IE I would appreciate it. I am also reaching out to PTs with more expertise in this area too. From my PT lit search there very little info on this condition pre-operatively regarding mobility besides our regular precautions. However it seems they can go south very quickly as this poor man did. Thank you for your consideration TL/Dr. Guidance on mobility management of acute sepsis from endocarditis in patient who is declining .

2. u/BruinBornBruinBred [score=14, created=2025-07-31T21:51:06]: I order PT for every patient I treat especially if I expect a prolonged hospitalization. IE is not a contraindication to PT and if anything, the exercise and movement are protective. PT has been demonstrated multiple times to shorten hospital courses so unless the PT themselves are unable to safely perform their duties (hemodynamic instability, unable to follow commands, etc) then I insist that all my patients remain on a PT regimen. Even small in-bed mobilization exercises help.
3. u/H_is_for_Human [score=3, created=2025-07-31T23:12:36]: While there's nuance in how various valvular lesions can contribute to heart failure, there's not really special precautions from a PT perspective other than for severe obstructive lesions (severe to critical AS or MS for example). I'll add that it can sometimes be an uphill battle to convince our surgical colleagues that these patients are "well enough" for surgery, and for better or worse, PT documentation of their ability to tolerate physical activity can make the difference in a surgeon taking the patient or not, hence why people may push for your involvement when it seems like there's more pressing matters. Certainly, having precautions regarding specific vital sign abnormalities and checking with the team before working with the patient if you have concerns is good practice to avoid doing something dangerous.
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2025-08-01T00:08:21]: There are a couple of things here... IE can be a subacute process. Often times we treat these patients with antibiotics inpatient and then outpatient with or without surgery. The number of valves involved does not matter, but the severity of the valve lesions can matter a lot. A vegetation (infection) on a valve is concerning but does not necessarily cause immediate problems for a patient. When it impairs valve function, causes ongoing sepsis/infection or embolizes, that is a more urgent condition. This patient has a few red flags that justify your recommendation to defer PT. Confusion in an IE patient is not normal and likely represents either septic emboli to the brain or a systemic process (such as sepsis or shock). Either of these are concerning enough to not exercise the patient. Additionally, hemodynamics instability in an IE patient is concerning as is a reduced EF. Either of these conditions imply that the IE is complicated by severe valve dysfunction, septic shock, embolization or stress/taketsubo cardiomyopathy. Any of these situations are more urgent/critical and should prompt a hold on PT activities such as ambulation. Generally, these patients need urgent or semi-urgent procedures and.

6. u/sovook [score=1, created=2025-08-01T16:25:45]: I am just wondering because I was listening to Step one cards material. EF 35% and low pedal pulse are indicative of Aortic insufficiency; but mitral being right side would be the cause of foot swelling (Lasix as described). The majority of TEEs were scheduled for Tue-Thur due to the post procedure clinic for cards closing on the weekends to your point about the report - however in the procedure notes they state how the patient tolerated the procedure and what was or was not clearly visualized. Would the vegetation be caught at that point since it’s typically charted at real time? Also, did the patient have other symptoms of Embolism, tachy is 1 but not typically reported unless paired with erratic respiration and breathing characteristics, typically when the charge nurse is notified prior to the Doc on amion. The Left sided concerns would be priority, according to step 1, (trying to understand how the surgical team would sort patients on acuity) but with so many varying symptoms, was a sepsis alert started? Would Heprin have been started to prepare for surgery and wouldn’t that worsen the tachycardia, so gradually introduction at a lower infusion rate take priority to get the patient to the OR? I’m trying to understand the algorithm as this sounds so complex.
