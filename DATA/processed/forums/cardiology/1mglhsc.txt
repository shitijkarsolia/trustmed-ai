===============================================================================

Hi, Newly grad from a good academic institution; I am starting as a hospitalist. During residency I wanted to become EP, but was also debating for other social issues (visa etc), and was overwhelmed a bit with everything. I had some research and have good connections, the hospital I am at, and the city I am in have good cardio and EP fellowships, even combined cards-EP. Though, they won't take visa-bearing candidates. I think I had a strong foundation to apply fellowship at the time, and now kind of regretting that I haven't applied. Though, part of me happy that I will become a perm resident, will have a good financial cushion and will have the time to build the perfect knowledge base/research and connections. My only concern is that I am getting old, now I am 29 y/o, and by the time I complete my waiver I will be 32, and if I do cards+EP; by the time I am free, I will be close to my 40s. Not sure, if that will be too late to go into the attending life, how was your experience? Thank you! In another post, I will ask recommendations for reading!

2. u/shahtavacko [score=18, created=2025-08-03T08:16:18]: I was 39 when I started practicing (long story), I’ll be turning 60 in less than a month. It’s been great. If that’s what you want to do, go for it. Remember that after so many hard years, you do not want to open your eyes in the morning and hate what you’re about to go and do. Do what you love, you deserve it.
3. u/redicalschool [score=6, created=2025-08-03T10:12:14]: The other posters have great advice and more experience than myself, but I will be 39 when I finish gen cards next year. And I will be applying to EP, so 41 before I'm done with training. What helps me is thinking about what I want to be doing at 60 instead of 40, i.e EP. Sure, it's tempting to start looking for gen cards jobs to begin making real money, better hours than the last 7 or so years of my life, etc. But if I jump off the training carousel now at gen cards, it is highly unlikely that I can force myself to go back to EP later.

5. u/North-Leek621 [score=3, created=2025-08-03T11:04:23]: 29 and an attending, I'm 26 and just started my first year of med school haha
6. u/CaramelImpossible406 [score=3, created=2025-08-03T20:00:30]: 29 y/o who is an attending said he/she too old. Ok what does that make me as a 34 y/o new intern looking at cardiology. Well to each their own.
7. u/truongta1990 [score=2, created=2025-08-03T16:47:42]: If you love what you want to do and you will find out soon enough, why not
8. u/Remote-Status-3066 [score=2, created=2025-08-04T08:42:32]: Do what makes you happy. A lot of the cardiologists at my work are honestly pretty old (70-80s) that still come in once a week for out patient clinics. You’re never too old to do what you’re passionate about. So many of our docs that retire come back because they miss it.
9. u/UnhappyWater4285 [score=2, created=2025-08-04T13:42:10]: You are still too young and you can do it of course but let me ask you why do you want EP ? Have you been to EP lab ?
10. u/Hungry_Steak_7044 [score=2, created=2025-08-04T17:31:38]: A second year cardiology fellow here, just curious why EP
11. u/Fabulous-Ad5980 [score=2, created=2025-08-06T18:33:43]: Start by reaching out the someone on the ACC FIT leadership council. Ask the to set you up with a mentor who has been in your shoes. The reality is that you aren’t that old for a cardiology applicant and other visa bearing fellows have gone through this. At this rate you’ll be 37 or 38 when you finish EP. I’ve seen much older. The main question in my mind is whether or not you’ll actually want to go back to training after being staff for 3+ years. Going back to the trainee mindset, pay, and work/life balance is very difficult and it would be very reasonable of you to say that it isn’t worth it, especially if family matters are at play.
