Reason is obvious, unpredictability of assignments, locums strong arming you and not fulfilling your commitments and more importantly lifestyle Gave my a assignment in August and that facility backed away now what i am gona do with my month? I dont get paid cant quickly find another one!. Whole month wasted Just find a good place in Midwest and you will get 1 million plus. Negotiate for 8-12 weeks vacation (8 week is standard) and try locums in that time if you want to

Mostly because it’s full of the old timer ICs that can’t really acclimate in the hospital employed world (ie they can’t hold a job) and that generation has nothing to retire too since this has been their life and who are mostly broke through their life choices and will take any rate thrown at them. I joke but that’s about 90% of the guys I know that cover my region (5-6 states). I do think it’ll open up in about 5 years when those guys stroke out. But locums is tough. Dealing with a cardiogenic shock patient that is coding on the cath lab table with a staff you’re not familiar with, equipment you’re not familiar with, a hospital system you’re not familiar with usually in some podunk/town hospital with no resources is not worth the $125-150/hr it comes down to on the going $3000-3500/day rates. Plus being on call 7+ nights in a row is tough. As another alluded to if you want that type of shift-based lifestyle just contract directly with one hospital that you’ll cover 14 days a month.

7. u/spicypac [score=0, created=2025-08-10T21:11:21]: Not the same as Locums, but our hospital has hired a couple “per diem” interventionalists. They get compensated well but they’re worked like dogs.
