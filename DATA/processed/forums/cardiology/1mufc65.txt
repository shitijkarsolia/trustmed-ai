Hi guys. I’m presently a UK cardiology resident and interested in doing a fellowship in the US. Just a bit of background about me: My interest is in imaging cardiology (cross sectional)/inherited heart disease…I’m going to be approaching the end of my cardiology training in around 2-3 years and am midway through a PhD at a large research university that usually ranks well globally with a well reputed research group…my work is likely to result in a major publication as a minimum and I’m also leading on a fairly significant RCT which I should hopefully be presenting as a late breaking trial next year at either ESC or AHA depending on how timings work. My own PhD is funded through a competitively awarded research fellowship grant (it is pretty competitive within the UK though I imagine this wouldn’t get me much credit in the States). I’d probably have achieved European level 3 CMR accreditation by the end of this year (exam plus reported 300 MRIs) and hope to also have knocked off my cardiac CT level 2 in the next year or 18 months (exam plus reported 200 studies I think). I could work towards transthoracic echo certification if it would help my application but I also want to do some training in cardiac device implantation here in the UK. I am interested in working in a new environment, largely for experience, and just wondered how feasible it is to get a cardiac imaging fellowship as an IMG in the US? I have no real long term intention of being in the US at this stage and want to return to the UK to take up a consultant job. I presume I’ll have to get ECFMG certified and sit Step 1 and Step 2 CK as a minimum but realistically I’m only going to bother putting in the effort doing them if I have a decent chance of securing a fellowship somewhere. Similarly, my LoRs are likely to be from UK consultants/professors, granted one or two of them are of international renown…I’ve never worked in the US and therefore wouldn’t be able to get LoRs from US attendings. Advice appreciated.

Take a look at the website below. Programs specifically list when they are open to foreign fellowship graduates (which is what you would probably qualify as, even if you are technically a cardiology residency graduate). [https://www.acc.org/Membership/Sections-and-Councils/Imaging-Section/Training-Resources](https://www.acc.org/Membership/Sections-and-Councils/Imaging-Section/Training-Resources) I would contact some of the programs and ask about requirements (for exams, etc.). In the USA, cardiac imaging fellowships are not accredited by the ACGME. This means that they don't have to follow strict rules about who participates, what the experience entails, etc. Programs can more or less do whatever they want. You may or may not be required to take ECFMG, Step exams, etc. depending on the program. Programs that are listed as for "US fellowship grads only" may even be willing to take you if they want. I know that you plan to move back home after this experience. However, keep in mind that if you want to be eligible to practice in the USA, you will need to pass all the various tests AND do a primary residency in the USA (like internal medicine). Depending on goals, you may need to repeat cardiology too. If you are considering a US practice, imaging fellowship may not be the best place to start.

3. u/DJ_Doza [score=3, created=2025-08-20T05:43:12]: Currently in my second year as an advanced imaging attending at a large academic center in the northeast with an imaging fellowship. As said elsewhere, the programs are not ACGME accredited, so they vary widely in what they offer. You really have to speak directly with programs and do your research to know what they really offer. Avoid programs that seem to let you do anything as they are typically less organized, and you really don't want to be "jack of all trades, master of none" at this level. My advice would be to pick 2 modalities to master, with a 3rd as expert/compliment. I have level 3 of CMR and CCT, so I stopped focusing on echo and really gave up all nuclear outside of the occasional SPECT MPI they need me to read.
