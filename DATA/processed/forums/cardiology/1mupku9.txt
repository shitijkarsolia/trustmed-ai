New cardiology fellow here. I learn terribly from reading. I do better with application and questions. Is there a way I can become a good echo reader without reading lots of text?

Like if you see severe MR then review the criteria for severity and indications for surgery etc. You can't just brute force it, there's too much info. But if you're reading enough echoes a day, you'll see enough abnormalities that you'll end up reading most of the guidelines. The rest will be covered when you study for echo boards.

ASE has awesome YT vids that I’ve studied from as well as the Echo pocket book that goes over basically everything from scanning views to chamber quantification to diseases and it’s simplified. I’d also add that scanning and performing echos will help immensely in your understanding for interpretation.

6. u/justhanging14 [score=2, created=2025-08-19T16:13:04]: How can you even learn if you don’t read?
7. u/MaadWorld [score=2, created=2025-08-19T17:31:12]: Sure, but tbh the guidelines aren't bad an explain a lot in a simple way. I find the videos help with visual reference and may sometimes provide contexts but if you actually sit down and skim you will realize they are meant for simple explanation
8. u/Excellent-Tea2125 [score=2, created=2025-08-19T23:14:41]: It’s more for actual echo boards but in hindsight doing some of the basic sections of Klein (textbook of questions) may be helpful

The generation of the future, that we all feared would be too goddamn lazy to become adequately prepared for the jobs that keep us alive, is here…the future doctors don’t wanna read, my future surgeon better have some fvkkn BOOKS under his belt !!!!😭
