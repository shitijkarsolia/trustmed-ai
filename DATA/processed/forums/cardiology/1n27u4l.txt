Hi, I’m about to start my final year of medical school in Italy, and I have a strong interest in pursuing a career in cardiology. I’m reaching out to ask for your suggestions and recommendations, as I’m currently considering doing a PhD in cardiovascular research. I’ve spent several weeks shadowing in cardiology wards. While I greatly enjoy the clinical work, I also want to gain experience in research. My impression from shadowing was that most clinicians primarily follow established guidelines to diagnose and treat patients. Before fully committing to clinical practice, I would like to gain cutting-edge knowledge in a specific area through research, and then transition into a more clinical role. My first question is whether, in your opinion, pursuing a PhD is a valuable step for someone aiming to become a cardiologist. Does having a PhD provide meaningful benefits in this field? If so would you recommend doing the PhD before or after residency? And lastly do you have any recommendations regarding institutions where I could pursue a PhD? One idea I’ve been considering is applying for a PhD position at the Karolinska Institute after graduating from medical school. During the four years of the PhD, I plan to learn the language so that I can later choose to do my residency either in Italy or Sweden. Thank you very much for your time and any insights you can offer.
