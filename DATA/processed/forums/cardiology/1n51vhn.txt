===============================================================================

Hello, I joined the subreddit because I was recently hired to a position in which I'm doing probably 5 to 10 EKGs daily, but I have practically no previous experience in the field. I've started doing deep dives into researching things like the electrophysics of how the leads even work, variations in limb lead placement, and accuracy of lead interpretations. What I'm finding is that while EKGs are performed incredibly frequently in hospitals and emergencies, there seems almost no formal training for performing them. I'm seeing research showing that supine-position limb-lead placement recommendations can be anywhere from the wrist/ankle to the torso and that placement can noticeably or negligibly impact the results. I'm seeing some people on reddit advising others to put electrodes V4-V5-V6 in a horizontal plane and others saying to follow the 5th intercostal space. I've been told personally on the job by one person to make sure V3 goes below the sternum and by another person that the RA and LA electrodes MUST be located above the heart, and I have gathered both pieces of advice are inaccurate at best. I'm seeing research showing EKG interpretations by physicians are only about 50-75 percent accurate. Tl'dr: The incredible lack of training and variations in techniques in performing EKGs is confounding to me. So, I want to ask this subreddit's opinions: How much faith do you put in a standard hospital EKG and the people performing them?

I would just do it as instructed in the textbook. If other people want to deviate that's on them.
2. u/Intelligent_Year3975 [score=13, created=2025-08-31T11:31:35]: I think the biggest issue with ekgs is baseline artifact/noise rather than not positioning leads correctly. Lead positioning is usually fine unless there is lead switch, or you have to be careful when you are trying to localize VT or a bypass tract
3. u/poulix [score=7, created=2025-08-31T11:32:06]: Depends on where you’re located. Across most of Canada, for example, they have to be certified/qualified and have a registration exam. It’s typically up to a 2 year program. So I guess the amount of trust depends on the location/hospital regulations
4. u/cteno4 [score=3, created=2025-08-31T15:20:43]: It’s good to know what the purpose of the leads is. The limb leads are largely to determine the QRS axis, and vicariously to get the rhythm strip via the lead most likely to capture the axis, II. As such, you can’t really mess up the placement too much. The Ventral leads are much more important. They help determine infarct territory. V1 and V2 should be placed above the R and L atria, ideally, and also correspond to the septal plane. From there V3-V6 capture the rest of the heart with V6 ideally corresponding the left lateral side ( i.e. at the mid-axillary line).
5. u/agro5 [score=3, created=2025-08-31T22:27:46]: As a lot of people have said, the precordial (chest) leads are the ones where placement matters the most, however limb lead placement does matter too. For an educational topic I once did a few test EKG’s with different placement. In one example I placed the limb leads on the upper chest and lower abdomen, and this caused notably different QRS morphologies. If V1 and V2 are too high up you can get inverted P waves. If V5-6 are placed too anterior you can get what looks like poor R-wave progression. Tips and tricks from me on getting a good and clean EKG, that have no actual evidence but are just anecdotal. For the limb leads I use the lateral upper arm approximately 1/3 of the way down from the shoulder and then the medial lower leg about 1/3 up from the ankle. I also palpate for the 4th intercostal space for V1/2 and then base the others off that. For V4-6 I palpate the next space down and place off of that. I use the horizontal method if I cannot feel the space well or all the way around. If it’s hard to feel for the intercostal spaces, the Angle of Louis, which is the bump near the top of the sternum, is at the level of the 2nd rib and therefor the 2nd intercostal space is just below that. To reduce artifact I have the patient rest their arms at their side and lay their head back, no talking. I also have the bed laid at a 30-45 degree angle (if they can tolerate it). Also, if you’re getting a lot of artifact from their breathing, you likely have the electrodes too low, or they need to be laid back more to elongate the space between the chest and abdomen. I have also on a rare occasion asked the pt to hold their breath for the 10 seconds if they are able and it’s appropriate. ETA: to answer your question, and seeing how sloppy and poorly some of my coworkers do EKG’s, I wouldn’t trust them too much in a critical setting. But for a “routine” ekg where there likely isn’t any cardiac issues and we’re getting it for a baseline/CYA I think they turn out fine enough.
6. u/wencky [score=2, created=2025-08-31T16:06:18]: Training and feedback definitely matters but I don’t think it requires that much gatekeeping tbh.
7. u/rads2riches [score=4, created=2025-08-31T11:34:02]: Outside of limb lead reversal it’s hard to screw up a 12 lead. Its largely only important to cardiac EPs who may offer ablation based on 12 lead.
8. u/Hot_Information182 [score=3, created=2025-08-31T11:51:16]: I don’t trust it. Had someone chatty do one at a walk in clinic that showed a possible mislead or rsr or right heart strain. Then got sent to a cardiologist Student did mine in a hurry, showed possible left atrium enlargement. Geez!! Have no clue what’s wrong now!
9. u/jack2of4spades [score=2, created=2025-08-31T14:04:22]: Iffy. Limb leads are whatever. I often see the precordial leads placed incorrectly but you can generally tell they were placed incorrectly and how by looking at the EKG. V1 and V2 are often placed too high and V5 and V6 too medial. Limb leads are relatively simple but I still notice reversals occasionally.
10. u/HumanContract [score=1, created=2025-08-31T18:01:25]: Know your left from right, place leads as close to where they should go as possible. Your ekg machine tells you where to put them in 2 pictures. Cut down artifact, decrease trending or interference. It's not that hard to screw up outside the ER and rapid situations.
11. u/siegolindo [score=1, created=2025-09-01T12:53:49]: Everyone’s body type will be slightly or vastly different presenting challenges in placing leads according to their anatomical position. I learned EKG placement as a paramedic, including right sided EKGs and know of a certificate for EKG placement some medical assistants or hospital techs can take. The best you can do is make sure the EKG is clean and free of artifacts so it can be read to best of the ability of the interpreter.
12. u/vasjpan002 [score=1, created=2025-09-03T10:02:41]: Cf EKGGuy. I am also working on algorithms. EKG reading skills are generally distorted
13. u/kdot2324 [score=1, created=2025-09-03T23:32:10]: They are mostly accurate with proper lead placement, but I’ve seen plenty of incorrect EKG readings over the years.
14. u/4Dogs4Life [score=0, created=2025-09-01T10:56:32]: No faith at all. No one does them right anymore and god forbid I try to point it out ( former ER RN) they cop an attitude Medicine today is awful I try in my nicest way to tell them but THEY know best 🤣🤣 I don’t trust most people who do EKGs anymore However, a previous visit I had to the ER I had to add normal EKGs, the doctor thank God actually came in and did one himself (Navy doctor). My results: NSR Normal Sinus Rhythm But I got very lucky rarely does the ER doctor come in and do them on you for some reason this doctor just knew something was up
