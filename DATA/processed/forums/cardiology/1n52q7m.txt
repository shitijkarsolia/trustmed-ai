===============================================================================

70 year old pt came to er for multiple falls and left rib pain after falling and hitting his head. Ekg was abnormal and i was asked for input. Hstrop was 67000. What do you think is going on here? Would you activate or wait or on it?

1. u/Onion01 [score=19, created=2025-08-31T11:55:27]: Late presenting inferior STEMI. I would decide whether or not to activate the lab based on story, timeline, and current symptoms.
2. u/jiklkfd578 [score=7, created=2025-08-31T12:07:54]: Head and chest CT to rule out bleed/trauma. Then to lab. Likely a late occlusion of an RCA which often don’t reperfuse well/easily.. or are worth chasing.
3. u/cardiofellow10 [score=8, created=2025-08-31T12:43:57]: Agree with everything you all have pointed out. The reason for posting this was that these are subtle st changes and technically only lead 3 meets 1mm criteria. I actually activated it before we got the troponin bc of the q waves/st elevations and the reciprocal changes. Also pt falling multiple times (possible arrhythmia??). Prior to that got a head ct which was negative and sure enough rca prox was 100%. As a late stemi behaves this was difficult bit eventually opened the vessel and did pci x2 with good results. There were no collaterals to the rca. I think its important to see the whole picture and do a LHC for the unanswered qs rather than calling it a late stemi and calling it a day. EF preserved no vsd/pap muscle rupture etc.

Late presenting, no pain, if control trops are lower than initials would probably do ischemia testing first. Did it have akinesia or hypokinesia on echo?
5. u/Individual-Charge-23 [score=1, created=2025-09-09T23:02:00]: look at his lead 2, classic STEMI
