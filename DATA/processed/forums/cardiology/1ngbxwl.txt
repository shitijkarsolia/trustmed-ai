For those who have taken CT boards…beyond SCCT videos and the SCCT questions, what else can I do to prepare? How were the questions…fair? Really not sure what to expect per my searches of forums. Appreciate any advice!

I’m an ED doc and a family member is very nervous about cath and considering coronary CTA for noninvasive testing to start. Had a negative PET 1.5 years ago with some persistent exertional pain, potentially stable angina vs non-cardiac chest pain. His cardiologist does not read these studies and is unsure of the sensitivity/accuracy of coronary CTA given this family member is morbidly obese 5’10” 350lbs. This would be performed at a major academic center with good HR/premedication protocol in place. TIA for anyone who can weigh in specifically about the significance of the morbid obesity on scan diagnostic accuracy.
