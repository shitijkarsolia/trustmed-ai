===============================================================================

I applied this year for a cardiology fellowship with strong scores, 15 publications (a mix of literature reviews, case reports, and abstracts), a book chapter, two ongoing IRBs, and presentations at ACC and applied all over where they give my visa- non-US IMG; yet, the season has been not good The only factor I can think of that might be a barrier is H1B visa. So, I am looking toward the next step-- either a nocturnist vs a cardiology hospitalist vs one-year fellowships ( HF) vs crit care fellowship for empty spots. What would you recommend to increase my chances of matching, hopefully next year?

2. u/zeey1 [score=9, created=2025-09-14T05:33:00]: You wont get interviews with h1b Also remember cardiology isnt about scores publications or cv .its about who you know(especially for IMGs since we are the second tier candidates anyway)
3. u/imtocardio [score=3, created=2025-09-14T12:40:42]: It's the visa that's hurting you, not your candidacy. You already have a good profile. If you're a non Indian born IMG get your green card first. Work at a program where they take cardiac hospitalists. You can do a non accredited fellowship too but only do it if they take those candidates (most programs don't take their own non accredited fellowship candidates, and if so, don't waste your time with those and lose hospitalist money and ability to get a green card during that time as these non accredited programs won't sponsor a green card and are just looking for cheap labor). Get an EB2-NIW petition filed to lock in your priority date since you have decent research. For the next cycle get LoRs from ppl who are well known names on the field.. The common advice of 'A strong LoR from your community program cardiologist is better than a generic LoR from a well known figure' isn't true in cardiology. It's ALL about connections, especially with no scores to compare (Step 1) and with every candidate having 15-25 pubs and 30+ abstracts on an average ( usually paper mill type, low quality ones). If you're bold, try applying to J1 programs too the next cycle (especially if you're Indian and can't get a green card soon). It's better to do a waiver job as a cardiologist than work as a hospitalist for 5 years, frustrated about not being able to follow your dreams. Finally don't give up. You've worked hard for this and you will get it in the end. It's a question of WHEN and never IF. Good luck👍.

5. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2025-09-14T15:16:21]: I would avoid the AHFTC pathway. While there’s a # of unfilled spots every year, most still prefer to match someone who is in cardiology fellowship And want to do AHFTC long term
