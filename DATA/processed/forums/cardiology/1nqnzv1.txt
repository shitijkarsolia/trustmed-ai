===============================================================================

This pertains to the patients in the south. I’ve noticed men especially in their 40s have this deep rooted belief about statins being a dangerous pharma peddled lie designed to ruin their sex drives and turn them into mindless shills. Who is spreading this misinformation and why is this demographic so susceptible?

Combine that with the fact that the general public doesn’t know about hitchens razor, and now ppl with an LDL of 200 and an LP(a) in the triple digits have decided they want to place their faith in Alphafitdad or whatever instead of experts in the field.

I don’t know who decided to run a smear campaign against one of the best drugs we got but here we are. As I like to say, “You are the captain of your own ship. You will also be the only one on it when it sinks.”

6. u/hardman52 [score=25, created=2025-09-25T18:59:43]: I'm on a few heart disease Facebook groups, and I'd estimate that more than half the members are firmly in the anti-statin camp. I would also guess that the great majority of those are also Trumpers, going by my unscientific haphazard occasional survey of their Facebook pages.
7. u/NYP33 [score=9, created=2025-09-26T07:23:22]: It took me at least 5 years before I felt comfortable taking statins. The delay was based on all the negativity I read about them and I would argue with my Cardiologist when he tried to recommend them. I did ALL the lifestyle changes and dietary changes and supplementation and although I dropped my cholesterol significantly, it wasn't really enough. I started on 5 mg of crestor and my cholesterol is almost half of what it used to be. The funny part is, my side effects were positive, my circulation has gotten noticeably better where I notice a much better libido and much stronger erections, wish I started them 10 years ago.

Can't tell you how many retired big-letter-behind-the-name types get a stent, refuse medicines beyond dapt for a year, and show up again a few years later. Oopsy daisy. Doesn't even take that long. One fella decided to take a med holiday for a summer and go on the paleo diet. One CABG later...
10. u/ChicagoDash [score=10, created=2025-09-25T20:10:37]: I (stupidly) let my parents talk me out of going on a statin about ten years ago, and opted for just better diet and exercise. One triple bypass later, and I really regret my decision.

I feel like we’re semi-successful. Maybe if their physician tells them AND the rehab team tells them, they’ll be more likely to be compliant.

I warn them that this is small regression but something about that word and concept in their mind has been a game changer to some of these patients
14. u/harrissari [score=2, created=2025-09-28T08:15:11]: The internet is rife with this. It's in social media, health support groups, and there's even rouge doctors promoting keto diets and shaming statins. Everyday, all over. But,on a sociology note- this is also how we've found ourselves into this entire political place in history. There's people who actually will believe anything as if their lives depended on it, and ironically, their lives will be at risk by listening and believing this crap. So- Darwin at play.
15. u/Michael-AHN [score=2, created=2025-09-28T13:17:59]: Lot of that is coming from social media. Information about the effects of cholesterol are being completely twisted and people don't know what's true anymore. Pharmacology is being vilified. It is not an easy area to navigate even for people educated in medicine anymore
16. u/Nandiluv [score=2, created=2025-09-29T20:43:46]: Strange. My now 61 year old brother was prescribed atorvostatin about 2 years ago after admission to hospital for DKA (DM2 was diagnosed about 3 years earlier- was under good control with diet and exercise after a short run on insulin-until after his second covid infection about 10 weeks beofre this admission for DKA). He is obese, never smoked and regular exerciser. Our dad had his first MI at 41. They incidentally found a serious problem with his heart. Particularly his heart rhythm. Echo showed significantly reduced EF (30%)and mild heart failure global weakness and hypokinesis. Angiogram showed no blockages. Cardiac MRI showed concerning evidence for sarcoidosis. Anyway he got biventricular pacemaker with ICD and was referred to University because of the heart failure and unclear cause. At that admission he started atorvostatin. Subsequent cardiac PET scan ruled out sarcoid and amyloidosis but the cardiologist had no idea what the tiny deposits in heart muscle and around the right atrium were that seem to cause inflammation. He hasn't had a calcium score done. "Idiopathic cardiomyopathy" was the final diagnosis. He texted me a few weeks ago and said the pharmacist from the cardiologists office said it was OK to STOP the atorvostatin. I was kinda shocked. My brother just asked about the med and had no problems taking it or concerns about taking it. He is taking his health much more seriously. His understanding was that his heart was much better and the pharmacist said it was OK to stop and just "wait and see". Wait and see for what? . He didn't know it wasn't a heart med so much as to reduce cholesterol. I asked him to really reach out the MD and clarify. Seems with DM2 that has since been very difficult to control, family history,etc seems like lowering risk worth taking the inexpensive med. Inpatient PT here that does inpatient cardiac rehab and post/op cardiac cases. yeah, resistance to statins everywhere. Sheesh I am on the drug now for a few years. Not a guy, but looking at the risk reduction and coming from a family of folks dropping dead from heart issues young I am on board. Well I still might drop dead from heart issues......
