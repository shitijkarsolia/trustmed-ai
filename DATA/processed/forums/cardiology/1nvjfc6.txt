Hello, what are your thoughts on pursuing structural vs CHIP vs peripheral? I know the job market is pretty saturated for structural, and with CHIP you usually need to be at an academic center. Plus, the extra year doesn’t necessarily mean higher pay, though it does make an operator much more comfortable handling complex, non-CTO lesions that take years to master. But I need more mature guidance from people in the field! I’m less familiar with peripheral, but I know there can be some challenges with vascular surgery and IR?!

It would give you the comfort handling most of what you can imagine with coronaries in cath lab - If you enjoy vascular interventions and expect to have a job at a place with less coverage of vascular surgery, vascular training is great, but personally a whole dedicated year is overkill unless you want to do Carotids or EVARs and very complex PAD stuff - If you enjoy STEMIS and PCIs but cath Lab is not all what you want to do in practise and enjoy mix of imaging, clinic and seeing patient's, do interventional year with all the passion and just join a busy practise. You will most likely financially come out ahead of everyone above. I was the most passionate fellow when it came to my interventional year and had excellent vascular experience and training during that year. And few years in a busy practise I want to be less and less in the cath Lab. There is absolutely no need to risk higher complications by doing high risk stuff unless its your passion. It just does not make sense in non-academic busy practise. I do coronaries and vascular in my busy practise and the real wrvus come from non-interventional work

3. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=8, created=2025-10-01T22:39:44]: If you want to be a mostly-coronary IC who also does a healthy dose of general cardiology, then IC with coronaries is a great career field, with plenty of jobs. Pretty much everything else is saturated so you have to either be super lucky or make major concessions to get a good job. I am involved in hiring for a very large practice. We mostly hire right out of fellowship or early-career. Here is some perspective: \- Most (about 80%) of our IC applicants have dedicated years of training for either structural or CHIP. \- We have hired a total of two people ever with dedicated structural training. One of them was hired with the understanding that he would have limited structural volume and eventually elected to stop doing structural (he makes more money after stopping). The other one heads the structural program. We have enough ICs in our group that are interested in doing structural cases that we tend to train them when we need more people fr TAVR and other procedures rather than hire a new person for that. \- We have never hired a new-grad or early-career person to do CHIP cases. We think those cases are best handled with our most experienced ICs (who often work with more junior ICs on those cases). \- We have hired people with evdovascular/peripheral training. We don't mind if applicants have this, but it does not benefit our group significantly, so we don't preferentially hire them. In our area, vascular surgery or IR do most of these cases and our group is not currently interested in taking PERT or CLI call. \- The applicants that we are most interested in are the ones with strong coronary training. \- This highest earners in our group are ICs that do not do structural (or significant endovascular/CHIP). \- The structural people in our group spend a significant amount of time coordinating the structural program. This means lots of meetings with hospital admin, fighting about reimbursement, planning meetings, outreach, etc. I also know quite a few early-career structural ICs who, even in mid-sized midwest cities, are only able to do very few structural cases because other IC colleagues prevent them from being able to do more (to protect their volume). Of all of these extra training opportunities, the one that makes the most practical sense is endovascular. However, that skill set is only valuable in certain regions and groups. It is also a skill that you can pick up after fellowship. When making this decision, don't be proud. If you love structural or really want a little more experience with complex cases, go ahead and do extra years. Do NOT expect this to make job hunting easier (it will do the opposite).
4. u/cardsguy2018 [score=5, created=2025-10-01T14:48:31]: In my area that's all saturated across the board. Extra training in any of those would be a complete waste of time.
5. u/Onion01 [score=5, created=2025-10-01T15:54:30]: I do structural and IC, and am an early career physician. In fellowship I wanted to be in the lab all day every day. I wanted every high risk, complex case. Now I'm happy to do 3 cases in the morning, round a bit, then head to the office for afternoon patients. I sort of wish I'd done a CHIP year so I could have that skillset in my toolbelt, but I have no passion for long cases.
6. u/docmahi [score=3, created=2025-10-01T18:02:17]: My practice is 50%+ endovascular now (I'm in 3rd year of practice) I did my interventional fellowship at a mid size university program that was primarily coronary focused. I joined a group with two high volume endovascular operators and the first two years of guarantee I scrubbed all of their cases with them. Endovascular in my opinion gives you a whole bigger dimension - I can generate significantly more RVUs in my venous work alone (PE/DVT) than I do with complex coronary. Additionally I think it made me considerably more marketable - Coronary volumes are fixed so it gives me the ability to maintain very high productivity without worrying as much about the coronary pie. I personally think a separate endovascular fellowship would not have been as helpful as actually just joining a group with a model and mentorship that let me pick up the skills on the job while still making a ton of money. Structural seems like a trap to me, I never even scrubbed a valve because I didn't want to like it. Job market is atrocious - interventional job market in of itself isnt great but man you add structural to that and good luck.

8. u/averagecardiologist [score=1, created=2025-10-01T18:17:04]: A big influence on +/- chip year is your experiences in your interventional fellowship program. Some programs have a high exposure to “chip” cases - and I would argue these graduates may not need a dedicated extra year.
