Hi All, hoping to get perspectives on adding Ziopatch reading to my practice. Does anyone currently read Zio (asynchronous, not mobile tele) and can comment on RVUs per Zio (interpretation only), as well as how many you read per hour once ramped up? There’s a large volume of studies and a nearby hospital asked for help with the read volume. Thank you!

2. u/PositivePeppercorn [score=3, created=2025-10-04T06:25:57]: Using CPT code 93248 for a patch worn for 7-15 days is about 1.4 RVU for the physician reading component only. So if you are paid $65 per RVU then it would be ~$90 per report. A little less if interpreting less than 7 days.

Most of them take a minute or two, and every now and then there will be one that takes you longer. you can even read them from your phone if I remember correctly when we used to use Zio patches.
