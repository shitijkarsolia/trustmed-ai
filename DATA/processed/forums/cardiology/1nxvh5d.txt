Hello, I’m a second year fellow, planning to apply for IC next year. I would prefer to train at a place where I can get a good peripheral experience. For people who have previously trained or applied this year, in your experience/search what programs offered the best of both worlds? Thank you.

2. u/supadupasid [score=7, created=2025-10-04T09:00:17]: Community programs tend to do this. By endovascular you mean PAD, renals, carotids? Special communities will do PEs- they new volume and good/or very bad rapport with VS. and of course evars and AAA will be done with extra fellowship. I think there exist at least one community program with they may do some AAA in the base IC fellowship but idk whats the volume/will you get signed off on it. But you have to do research but in general community programs will do a shit ton of procedures and more general cases… really academic you will get less first operator cases on average (start off the fellowship as second/third scrub for awhile) but see very advanced stuff which will require you to do a separate fellowship. IC is very heterogeneous. Ppl prolly shit on this but Ive heard of a IC program that has such volume to teach ic, structural, and basic pad in one year
