===============================================================================

I'm a PGY-5 Rheum fellow highly considering a switch to cardiology. I'm a USMD and was a good IM resident at an academic program with some cards research during residency. I wanted to pursue cardiology since med school. I love the physiology, ECG’s, echos/imaging, long term patient management, and procedures but had a brutal CCU rotation intern year and my home program was quite malignant, which pushed me towards Rheum. The fellows/staff in rheum were super chill and the lifestyle is pretty amazing. I don’t hate being a rheumatologist, some of the diseases can be rewarding to treat and patients are generally thankful, but I deplore the fibro/undifferentiated pain patients, non-specific testing and significant reliance on other specialties (renal biopsies, pulm for ILD, derm for psoriasis, ortho for joints). A lot of it feels like being the PCM/quarterback again. Cardiology was my original passion in medicine and non-invasive cards looks better on paper: hot market with most salaries in all locations being 500K+, more central in medicine, definitive testing/treatments, only piggy backing between IC/EP &amp; CTS. I know the downsides are an inpatient consult service/call, working nights/weekends, revolving-door admissions, and more training. I'm planning to try attending rheum lifestyle for a year or two before deciding to reapply. I still have some strong cards connections from residency, pretty much all my friends went cards. Age is a consideration as well, but I went straight through for everything so I’d be about 37-38 y.o. when finishing gen cards if am able to successfully match and retrain. I know some cardiologists who did 2-4 years of IM between fellowship so that's not too far off/unheard of. For those in non-invasive Cards: - Are you happy with your call burden, patients, hospital grind? - Do you find it fulfilling long-term, or just as repetitive as other IM subspecialties but with more stress? - If you could go back, would you still pick Cards over a lifestyle field like Rheum, allergy, endo (no call, nights, weekends, inpatient)?

2. u/docmahi [score=10, created=2025-10-04T16:19:44]: Oh man that sounds like quite the switch Me personally I KNEW that I wouldn’t be happy unless I did cards. I think if that isn’t the case for applicants I generally don’t recommend pursuing it. You have already committed a lot of time to training and only you can decide if it’s worth another 3 years minimum training As far as monetary I would not let that be the deciding factor
3. u/FielderXT [score=6, created=2025-10-05T05:50:07]: I’m in interventional cards but I do outpt majority of the week and see a bajillion pts, so hope my input might be useful. I fucking love it. Would pick interventional cards again in a heartbeat. And if I couldn’t do that then gen cards. 1. Each hospital will be different. The non-invasive clinical guys do one week inpt every 6-8 weeks. OP hours are like 8-4. 2. Every specialty has its fibromyalgia (we have palpitations, presyncope, obv non-anginal chest pain, dyspnea, and dreaded cardiac clearance)…cards is unique in that patients and referring providers believe their referral is super urgent bc “omg it’s the HEART”. And while I’m here, wtf is up with cardiac clearances? Have some goddamn self-respect, surgeons. Bad enough I have to do an effing preop clearance for a left eye cataract removal but then another for the right eye bc some idiot with w a scalpel arbitrarily thinks 32 days since the last one is too long? STRAIGHT TO JAIL. But preop clearances aside, I love cards and I don’t think even as IC my lifestyle is bad…Beats showing up to work miserable. I’m challenged every day and I know the shit I do saves lives and/or makes people feel way better psychologically and physically when I bring my A-game. I just have to bring my A-game every.single.day. But that keeps me motivated to stay healthy body and mind.
4. u/No_Association5497 [score=5, created=2025-10-04T18:09:59]: Still early in my career but I feel passion dies in a few months and at the end it’s a job you have to do to pay bills. I personally wouldn’t recommend switching it. You’re only 9 months from graduation and can live a very good life in rheumatology. If you move to a rural areas you can get a better salary too. Cardiology fellowship is pretty tough and I’m sure you’re aware of that.
5. u/No-Big-76 [score=4, created=2025-10-04T20:41:28]: I’m a non invasive cardiologist. Think of the worst consults you would get as a cardiologist- bs chest pains, palpitations, dizziness. As a fellow I told myself if I can live with seeing these consults as long as I got to take care of people with real cardiac issues I’m ok with it. So I would ask you the same thing.
6. u/jiklkfd578 [score=5, created=2025-10-04T20:49:33]: Good news is cardio-rheum is likely one of next big frontier in cardiology.
7. u/pills_here [score=3, created=2025-10-04T23:25:19]: The most challenging encounters in outpatient cardiology are a fraction of the "fibro/chronic pain/fatigue/1:40 ANA" consults you deal with in rheumatology. We can usually reach a conclusion one way or another with simple testing. It's one of my favorite aspects of the specialty. That said, if you like rheum fellowship overall, I highly doubt you'll go back for a second fellowship after a few years as a rheum attending.
8. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-10-05T13:20:07]: I think you should do cardiology if you want to. Even with 3 years down, you will probably come out ahead financially and it isn't worth doing a career in something yo don't like. If you want to stay academic or at a large center, you may also find some interesting things to do in the cards/rheum overlap areas. Of course there is PH, pericardial effusion. I also think that it would be wonderful for someone to come up with a strong framework for assessing cardiovascular risk of patients on many of these rheum drugs that are long-term. They are becoming much more common and it is probably important to do a better job with patient selection than we have right now.
9. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-10-05T09:08:35]: Lifestyle is determined more by job than specialty. Call, nights, patients, hospital grind, etc. will depend on the job. Gen cards can be a pretty good lifestyle. Everything for any specialty becomes routine, you just gotta be happy with the bread and butter that you'll deal with everyday for the rest of your career. 38yo isn't that old to become a "new" attending.
10. u/NuclearPotatoes [score=2, created=2025-10-06T12:41:20]: What are the logistics of doing a second fellowship in terms of funding / applications?
11. u/WSUMED2022 [score=2, created=2025-10-09T10:56:43]: Go for it. You can carve out a niche in cardiac sarcoidosis. Infiltrative/inflammatory CM are all the rage these days.
12. u/jgarmd33 [score=0, created=2025-10-06T17:35:04]: The statin non believers after just getting a heart attack. 🙄
13. u/themuaddib [score=-1, created=2025-10-04T18:48:38]: You should’ve just done cards from the start. You’ll make double the money and have more solid testing/disgnostics to solidly confirm/rule out diagnoses. Probably not worth having to do a second fellowship though tbh
