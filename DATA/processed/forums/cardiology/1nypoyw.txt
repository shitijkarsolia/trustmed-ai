===============================================================================

I'm going to replace my old stethoscope and would appreciate any recommendations/experiences regarding best models. I'm considering the 3M™ Littmann® Cardiology IV, but wondering about the Littmann CORE, which offers up to 40x amplification (at peak frequency, compared to analog mode), active noise cancellation, in-app sound wave visualization, and other features. Has anyone used either? Is the CORE a significant upgrade, or just hype? Other recommendations?

2. u/TuningForkUponStar [score=9, created=2025-10-05T11:37:58]: Thank you for your input. I ordered the Master Cardiology.
3. u/yangerang55 [score=33, created=2025-10-05T08:17:43]: Honestly I rarely seriously listen to patients anymore and just wait for the echo to show me what I care about.
4. u/DisposableServant [score=5, created=2025-10-05T16:11:43]: The shitty yellow one from the nurse supply closet works plenty well. Only use my cardio IV in the office as part of the show for patients. Honestly the difference between ability to detect truly significant abnormalities is minimal.
5. u/shahtavacko [score=4, created=2025-10-05T07:38:37]: I think master cardiology has served me very well through the years (more than 20); I prefer it over others and I’ve had a few.

7. u/chainwallet_ [score=3, created=2025-10-05T13:40:54]: I work in a cardio office...there's this old school MD that in my opinion is a li autistic. He swears by some Hewlett Packard stethoscope. I guess one day he broke or lost it (?). It's been discontinued for years at this point. He loved it so much that he contacted the company to make another one for him. He's a super reputable peds cardio doc in SoCal and actually made them make a new one for him... For what that's worth...
8. u/Godel_Theorem [score=2, created=2025-10-05T10:12:39]: Master Cardiology for the win!
9. u/RedFormanEMS [score=2, created=2025-10-06T04:07:57]: All of you are wrong. The nurse's stethoscope is the correct answer.
10. u/Broad_QRS [score=2, created=2025-10-12T16:07:10]: I find the Master Cardiology has better acoustics than the IV - both will do the job but once you get used to the Master, I think you’ll find that it’s really the best.
11. u/spicypac [score=1, created=2025-10-05T12:07:57]: I would say the CORE. There is a learning curve to it but I can hear everything very well. It does pick up on a lot of respiratory noise and you have to learn to navigate that. But I bought a Cardiology IV cause I was getting irritated with the CORE at one point, but then I couldn’t hear shit by comparison lol. Also tried someone’s Master Cardiology for a couple days and I just couldn’t hear well. The pressure thing was weird but I’m sure there’s a learning curve to that too. EDIT: saw that you ordered the Master Cardiology. Just save the receipt! give it a shot. Maybe it’ll be a slam dunk for you 👍
12. u/TomNgMD [score=1, created=2025-10-05T12:12:32]: The CORE will save you time, i cant hear anything with littman 4 especially when patient are supersized.
13. u/Fleebird3322 [score=1, created=2025-10-05T17:27:15]: Erka is pretty good.
14. u/Hway4 [score=1, created=2025-10-05T20:04:16]: Tried the core and gave it a try for 1.5 weeks and sent it back. It really just took up more time than needed overall.
15. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2025-10-06T09:56:00]: I have an Eko which is fancy (covered by HSA cost) and I appreciate its quality
