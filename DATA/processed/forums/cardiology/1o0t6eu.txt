===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I’m a PGY-2 Internal Medicine resident in a newly established community program (no in-house fellowship yet). My plan is to work as a hospitalist for a few years at a hospital that does have a cardiology fellowship, and I was wondering — could that increase my chances of matching into their program later on, or is it still quite competitive? Also, I don’t have much research experience so far, but I’m near a large academic center. What’s the best way to start getting involved in cardiology research and finding a mentor? Do cold emails to faculty usually work, or are there more effective approaches to connect and get started? Would really appreciate any insights or advice from those who’ve gone through similar paths. Thanks in advance!

At the same time you also have to not suck and be strong clinically and academically. Cardiology is still very competitive. Doing hospitalist will provide you no benefit besides any connections you can make to do more research. I’ve seen many lazy residents who expect to be handed a fellowship spot and are disappointed when they’re not. You have to be motivated and keep grinding. You need a strong application that is well rounded in every way, especially if you are coming from a community program.

3. u/gtarplyr98 [score=5, created=2025-10-07T18:48:37]: I went to an IM residency at a strong community hospital that had a brand new cardiology fellowship at the time. I had always wanted to do cardio but because of some life events I couldn’t apply and was a hospitalist at a community hospital without a fellowship. Throughout that time I kept in touch with the cardio attendings which definitely helped me get an interview and eventually a spot. Being a hospitalist was helpful because I was used to the heavy load of patients on my census and it helped me make decisions a little quicker. It also allowed the attendings to trust me a bit more which also gave me confidence and eventually I was chief. I also basically didn’t do any research before or during fellowship (I hate it) but I also didn’t get many interviews. I definitely think I got a spot because of networking, so start now. While I was in fellowship there were several hospitalists that were interested in applying. Some of them came to every noon lecture. This helped them network with the fellows and attendings and one or two actually got a spot. But some of them were kind of “clingy” or weird and it definitely hurt them. So being a hospitalist at a program may help you get an interview, but not a spot, so you still have to pump up your resume in other ways. I would email the program director at the program nearby or where you want to go and offer to help with any research that the fellows are doing (more to show your work ethic and collaborative side in my opinion), go to ACC and meet some program directors (helped some people get an interview at my program), audition in your off weeks as a hospitalist or moonlight, go to fellow noon conferences where you want to go (as long as they are cool with it), etc. But again, networking is key so start now!

First and foremost, you have to be clinically good- cardiology is a high acuity field and many programs will look for clinical skill first and foremost. This means doing well clinically in your residency and on away rotations (see below) on cardiology services at the other hospital. There are cases where residents who did a lot of research were not ranked highly by the program because of poor clinical performance. 2. Doing away rotations at the larger academic center if your program allows. See if they can work with you such that you do 2-4 weeks on their cardiology consult service or in their cardiology ICU. You can use that as a springboard to demonstrate clinical skill, good teamwork skills, etc. and meet attendings and discuss research. It may be more chart review-type stuff and they may have you work with a fellow at that program but its a way to ultimately get LORs. 3. Hospitalist years do not add much to the application by themselves, and some cardiology programs may be concerned if people have been too long out of residency (&gt;2 years for example) because procedural skills, exposure to cardiology, etc. can drop off. Alternatively, heart failure goes unfilled every year. If you are at the point of taking a hospitalist year, another alternative may be to do an unaccredited heart failure year which gets you 1 year at an academic program training with their HF attendings (and potentially research, etc.). After this, you would have a much easier time getting LORs from the HF attendings and you may have gotten some research through this. \*\*Note: I have heard of, but haven't met, people who did this. Best discussing with the cardiology PD at that program.

For research, start by identifying faculty with active cardiology projects at the nearby academic center. Cold emails do work if they’re concise and show genuine interest, but leveraging introductions through your attendings or colleagues is often more effective.
6. u/_lolli0 [score=1, created=2025-10-09T11:29:37]: Hi! I’m a PGY3 at an academic institution. I’m applying now, and I’ve done 11 interviews😭🙏🏾. What I can tell you, from what I’ve been exposed to so far, is that getting into cardiology is 90% about who you know. How you build that network can be through doing well clinically and RESEARCH exposure. I think the most efficient way for research exposure is through conferences -something I wish I would’ve taken advantage of more. If you can get your hands on a case report, at the very least, and submit it for presentation that gets your foot in the door. Cold emails work. Best if a faculty can introduce you like someone mentioned but not the end of the world if not. Express genuine interest and see what they say -they can really only say no. Send a bunch, meet with a bunch of people. Faculty at academic institutions are used to residents reaching out to them, and they are well aware that you have to shop around for a project that fits. Don’t worry about having to say “no” or meeting with too many people and not being able to commit at that first meeting. Focus on quality now instead of fluff quantity. I’m not sure if a hospitalist year just to do it will make you competitive. Getting a job as a CV hospitalist at an academic institution could be really beneficial though. Keep in mind that you’ll basically be auditioning for a year though. However, it will get you exposure to all the cardiologist in the department and if you’re good they can vouch for you (connections is key). A former fellow calling the PD on your behalf can get you an interview etc. Just my two cents.. but again, I haven’t matched yet!! But prayerfully I do🙏🏾 Good luck to you. You can totally do it!!
