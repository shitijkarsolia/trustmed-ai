===============================================================================

I have heard of several academic medical centers trialing a 2 years of general + 2 years of EP fellowship training path. Wondering what these are like and if they seem to be expanding.

3. u/steph-wardell-curry [score=13, created=2025-10-10T08:18:20]: In my limited experience they seem great with ep but shaky with other cardiology aspects
4. u/Angiotensin [score=7, created=2025-10-10T08:53:35]: My program rolled this out while I was a fellow. My cofellow that enrolled felt like his first two years were very busy to fit in his core general requirements. He also had to jump right in as an EP fellow and missed out on having third year to scrub cases and get the extra experience. Ultimately he did great but I think if you enroll be ready for a busy couple of years. I specialized in IC and definitely felt like I benefited from using my third year to get more procedure time, prep for general boards, etc.
5. u/Traditional-Twist-54 [score=6, created=2025-10-10T13:11:58]: 3rd year of cardiology is just as useless as 3rd year of im so id strongly encourage you to apply for 2+2 if available. The only downside, as some have already mentioned, is consolidating all your cocats requirments in 2 yeara instead of 3.
6. u/Gideon511 [score=4, created=2025-10-10T08:38:52]: I trained traditionally, many EP jobs may expect some degree of general cardiology also, I think it does add to the quality of your consultancy, on the other hand my friend trained that way and had an excellent result, in general your quality as a trainee will matter more than length of time in the program, most do benefit from an additional year of exposure to different aspects of general cards in my opinion.
7. u/Infinite-Log8829 [score=2, created=2025-10-10T15:40:23]: I was the first group of fellows that had to do two years of dedicated EP. Prior to that people would do 2 1/2 years of general and one and a half years ep. Sort of just going back to that but with less general and more EP. Honestly, probably not a big deal and saves you a year of life, but I will say that having three years of general cardiology and two years EP because they did not allow fast tracking when I went into it me a very competent general cardiologist, which helped a lot with passing the boards without difficulty.
