Hey cardiologists of reddit. IM R2 here applying to cardiology upcoming cycle. By this time, PDs and application committees have scoured through many personal statements and invited people to interviews etc. As I look towards my application next year, I wondered what even makes a good personal statement?

I've been told I have the best and most authentic ones they've read all year. Not everyone has my story but everyone has a story to tell. Don't talk about your cv they will fall asleep. Be raw (no trauma dumping) and genuine and it'll take you far

5. u/aethes [score=1, created=2025-10-12T12:13:30]: I feel like you really just need a generic personal statement. At this point in the game the personal statement is just there to check a box. What you really need are the letters of recommendation that will set you apart.
