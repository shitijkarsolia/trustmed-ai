===============================================================================

I’m struggling with cath coding for the upcoming boards. I’ve completed the CathSource section, but it only includes 22 questions, most of which focus on ventriculograms, which I’ve heard aren’t as commonly tested. Do you have any recommendations for additional resources or question banks that cover cath coding more comprehensively?

2. u/docmahi [score=4, created=2025-10-13T15:37:38]: The cathsource on ecgsource is the best representation The only random advice I can give is there is for sure a myocardial bridge just don’t miss that

4. u/ConnerVetro [score=1, created=2025-10-23T15:49:19]: Okeef Is trash. I would not recommend that source at all. So many errors, and very inconsistent.
