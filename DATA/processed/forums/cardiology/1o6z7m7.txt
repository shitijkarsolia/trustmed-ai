I’m not interested in “prestige” or research output. I’m interested in how *you* made your rank list. I like everyone else am trying to balance professional aspirations with personal obligations. Just wondering what specifics can help stratify programs

1. u/redicalschool [score=15, created=2025-10-14T19:38:48]: 1. How awesome I thought the programs were 2. How strong the programs were in my desired subspecialty (EP in my case) 3. Where do I want to continue raising my family? 4. Everything else
2. u/Wannabeachd [score=9, created=2025-10-14T19:46:55]: This decision is highly individual. Some variations but usually depends on overall quality of life (call structure, early dismissals, in-basket volume, percentage of free weekends), location fit (lifestyle, activities, social opportunities), and the scope of clinical exposure
3. u/FIRE_CHIP [score=8, created=2025-10-14T19:34:49]: How they do nights and weekends Internal super fellowships or not Who answers outpatient calls Who answers the outpatient monitor callsovernight Size of the fellowship Prestige (it should matter to you somewhat) Locations Job placement
4. u/therationaltroll [score=3, created=2025-10-15T09:53:47]: Where did the fellows from the last five years go?
5. u/benatryl [score=2, created=2025-10-14T20:50:02]: Clinically, what differences actually matter? Most programs seem to have minor-moderate differences that idk how much to weight in e.g. some have transplant vs more vad focus, some have cardiology involved more in MRI vs radiology led, maybe some you get a little more structural experience. But overall seems like you got reasonable exposure to most things at most places so just wondering if yall have thoughts on how to consider that
6. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2025-10-14T23:01:45]: 1. Did the program feel like a good environment (not toxic, fellows seem well-trained and happy). 2. Does the program have strong subspecialtys (even if you don’t plan to do them). 3. Is the location (region) where you would like to be for the next phase of life (possibly for a long time). If you are not planning to be a hard-core academic (which it sounds like you are not…if not doing the research thing) then prestige matters very little for fellowship. It is far more important to have strong training. That can happen at a high-prestige or middling prestige program.
7. u/creamasteric_reflex [score=2, created=2025-10-15T05:57:02]: I ranked on quality of life. Location, schedule and flexibility of rotations/ability to tailor training to your career preferences ie IC, EP or imaging etc
8. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-10-15T08:09:10]: Vibe. Clinical focus. Location.
9. u/wencky [score=2, created=2025-10-16T18:30:24]: Where alumni end up. How front loaded the program is. Do third years take call? Align with your goals in the next 3 years
10. u/aethes [score=1, created=2025-10-15T02:24:03]: QoL
11. u/BimBidBax [score=1, created=2025-10-30T13:19:32]: I am currently struggling with this. Different mentors have told me different things. The best advice I've heard so far is to "go with your gut"
