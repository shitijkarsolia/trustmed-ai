Hi, 1st year fellow here. A couple of questions and confusion. I realized quite early on that I like the cath lab and want to pursue interventional cardiology. I have 1 year left on my J1, but I'm concerned about the competition. In the case that I don't match into intervention, how challenging will it be to obtain a J1 waiver on time? My understanding is that if fellowship results are released in December, there will only be 6 months left in the third year of fellowship to secure a waiver, so I am worried about the backup option being weak here.

Apply broadly and you will match, or worst case scenario will be able to scramble into a position even if you don’t, you will still be able to get a waiver in time after results, might just have to push start date a bit.
