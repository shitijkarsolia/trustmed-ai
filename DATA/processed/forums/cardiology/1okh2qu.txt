===============================================================================

Hello everyone, I finished the second part of the exam yesterday. I did awful on both days. At first I felt it wasn't too bad, but as the hours go by, I realized how many mistakes I made and feeling really down about it. I started working right away after graduating fellowship, new job, new mom with a small baby. I didn't have as much time to study as I wanted, but I used every time off work I could to study including taking a few days of vacation/time off to use to study. I feel all I studied didn't help me much. I did most of boards vitals with 67% on first pass, I did 90% of EKGs on ECG source and scored 61% , did 90% of the EKGs on Okeefe and scored 69%. I did all the echos and caths from ECG source and Mayo course. I also watched most of the Mayo videos, some more than once. How was other people's experience with the exam this year?

I was brain dead coming out of day 1. The questions were so terribly worded and it was hard but felt fair in comparison to the second day. I don’t think the second day is realistic of modern day practice at all. It felt more of a “read my mind” test rather than a standardized test. Happy it’s over with. Let’s hope I don’t have to redo this next year. Now the three month wait begins
2. u/beepos [score=6, created=2025-10-30T18:12:24]: Hey, don't worry-I think nobody felt good coming out of that exam I also made stupid mistakes. My brain completely fucked up when it came to mitral valve guidelines. Theres at least one cath I royally fucked up I personally thought general cardiology boards was wayyy tougher than echo boards-I though echo boards was a tough buy fair test (I did pass easily, so maybe thats why). General Cards boards felt like a hard test that was poorly written-they obviously didnt proofread some questions (like when they said look at the Echo below and there was a CT)... My cofellows also thought it was a very hard test And worst case scenario and we fail? It sucks but we'll just take it next year. Thankfully nobody cares that much whether one passes or fails
3. u/TheCVascularGuy [score=4, created=2025-10-31T07:27:21]: I feel terrible after the second day. I wake up every night with questions, Ekgs and echos I did terribly wrong and stupid mistakes. I feel very down sometimes but at the end, I say screw them, life is bigger than a test and enjoy ur family
4. u/lagniappe- [score=4, created=2025-10-30T19:16:24]: You studied more than I did, I’m sure you did fine. There were a lot of questions on Day 1 that nobody could have prepared for, but overall I thought it was a relatively fair test. Day 2 should not exist in its current form. It’s absolutely bogus to have a test like that without a clear set of guidelines on how to code and what exactly they’re looking for. They should at minimum have a large question bank by the ABIM question writers on how to properly code. Instead there are THREE total practice questions. ABIM is an absolute freaking joke and should not be responsible for this test. That said, if they score the exam like O’Keefe does, I feel like it was straight forward but who really knows.
5. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2025-10-30T19:38:40]: I thought that was how board exams were always supposed to feel. Don't think about it. Just go about your life and wait for results. Playing the odds: you will probably be pleasantly surprised. If not: take it next year.
6. u/DisposableServant [score=2, created=2025-10-31T03:29:47]: Highly likely that you passed, a lot of ppl feel bad coming out of the board exam but the pass rate is ridiculously high. Studying for the boards is a marathon, not a sprint. On the off chance that you didn’t pass I’d recommend starting to study around January instead of June/July.
7. u/Major-Magazine9830 [score=2, created=2025-11-03T06:39:16]: Let me start by saying that I am not a cardiologist, nor even a physician. But, I have watched several close family and friends take their board exams, one cardiology and one sleep medicine, both coming out frustrated and discouraged and planning to change careers because they were sure their careers were over. Today, one is a sleep medicine specialist, and one is a cardiologist. My understanding is that those exams are ridiculously difficult and confusing on purpose, and everyone I have talked to feels like they failed them, but they didn't. Take heart, doctor, you're gonna be a board-certified cardiologist.
8. u/Icy-Beautiful-9529 [score=1, created=2025-10-31T18:45:31]: I felt bad coming out of the exam as well. I studied pretty hard for this test, but I feel like nothing could have prepared me for the trickery that was the exam. And don’t get me started on the EKG session. There were so few bread and butter EKGs that it seemed like they were trying to mess us up by showing us obscure EKGs only smh. Just praying for a big curve.
