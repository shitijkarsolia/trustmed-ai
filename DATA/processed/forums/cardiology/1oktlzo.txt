===============================================================================

I am a third-year fellow planning to take Gen boards next October. I am applying to IC this cycle so will be taking boards during my IC year. For those who have taken boards, what are the most high-yield resources that you recommend? Also, when should one reasonably start studying? Thanks!

1. u/FIRE_CHIP [score=13, created=2025-10-31T14:28:59]: Just finished boards. It's tough despite studying a lot and there is a lot of material that even with a year of dedicated I probably wouldnt have learned the stuff that was covered. Stems on the board are long 2-3x the stems on ecg source. Included a lot of tidbits that were purposely trying to lead you the wrong way. Don't have scores back but I used a combination of ACC sap, Mayo, ecg source, and okeefes. ACC sap questions are too basic but covers most of the topics covered. ACC sap videos and pdfs are good but maybe a bit too broad for the boards. They'd be good to use now a year in advanced. Mayo covered a lot but a bit more focused and less content overall than ACC sap. I'd recommend these the couple months leading up to the boards. ECG source was good for ekgs Okeefes better for angios and echos
2. u/Angiotensin [score=6, created=2025-10-31T09:10:51]: I did the same as an IC fellow and I used the Mayo board review course as my main source of info, definitely recommend that. I’d listen to videos on my way to work or just passively between cases. I used that and ACC SAP and felt like between the two that was enough. I started studying lightly about 2 months before boards and ramped up towards the end of that. It felt like enough time. One thing that helped me is taking echo boards the year before so I had a lot of that stuff in my head still. There’s a decent amount of echo on general boards. The other thing that’s different about cardiology boards is coding ECGs/Echos/Caths. The Mayo course had practice sections for coding and I found that helpful. You just need to get used to the terminology and scoring system. I’d save most of the coding stuff for the end so it’s fresh when you take the test.
3. u/Boskouei [score=3, created=2025-10-31T21:26:22]: The other guys here said the main stuff for resources. I took mine several years ago back in 2017 but it seems the resources are the same. - know the guidelines COR. I and III, s - I took both ACC and Mayo’s live courses. Mayo was more helpful and targeting boards ( for both general and IC) I could review their videos several times ( if you have access, start Right now to watch them. Take notes. - for ECG OKeefe was very helpful esp with coding. ( that is what gets you on actual board, you likely know the dx but errors on coding hurt the scores . - I had taken the echo boards and it helped me with general. - talk to your IC program at the very beginning and ask for several off days before the day of boards. In my case I didn’t know, the other two fellows took a week off and I got stuck to work till last minute! Of course you start several months before for intensive study but those last reviews on easy to forget guidelines and codes are important -statistics and epidemiology are still there, Mayo used to cover them well. 4x4, NNT, sensitivity, specificity, etc And ….Good luck
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-10-31T22:55:22]: IMO the three highest yield things are... \- Mayo Clinic Board review series (video or in-person lectures) - If you like to listen instead of read. \- ACC SAP - Questions are too simple but if you read explanations, you'll brush up on a lot and it will make it clear which things you need to review a little. \- ECG source - Probably the best resource to review formal ECG interpretation. Early on in studying (and again shortly before the exam), I recommend that you take a few minutes and review the [tutorials on the ABIM website](https://www.abim.org/about/abim-exams/exam-tutorials/), especially for "ECG &amp; Imaging". It only takes a few minutes but it gives you a good idea of what the actual exam answer sheet will be like. I will say that, of all the board exams I have ever taken, this one left me feeling the worst. I ended up doing just fine, but the exam is demoralizing...especially day 2.
