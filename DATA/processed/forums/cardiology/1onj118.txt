===============================================================================

Assuming procedural exposure/volume otherwise being equal, curious to hear to what extent program ‘name’ matters for the community job market. Specific scenario I am in - I’ve been out of general fellowship and practicing noninvasive cards for about 3 years now, and am interviewing for EP fellowship. My home program (community) where I did gen cards training informally offered me an EP spot. I’ve interviewed broadly and have several larger academic programs that I have a solid chance of matching as well. My home program is by no means forcing me to lock them in, and they’ve graciously offered to pick up the phone and call other programs if I want them to. Part of me wants to go to a larger academic program, but a not insignificant part of me wants to go back to my home community program where I know the group well, know there is adequate exposure to the breadth of EP (except epicardial VT), and have a good relationship with the non-EPs as well. I would also be able to scrub into IC cases for pericardiocentesis, impella placement, diagnostic angiograms, etc as there is no in-house IC fellowship. The fact that I’ve been out of the lab for 3 years also gives me some worry about being thrown abruptly back into a hard-charging procedural fellowship, and going back to my home program at least gives me the comfort of familiarity, at the cost of it not being an academic place. My ultimate goal is to practice community EP, and I wouldn’t mind an 80/20 EP/gen cards split given I’ve already built up significant gen cards experience. I’m currently boarded in echo (level 3), CT and Nuc (level 2 for both), if that’s relevant. I’d appreciate any guidance/opinions/perspectives others may have.

2. u/Gideon511 [score=16, created=2025-11-03T11:45:00]: If you want an academic EP job, name helps, if you want to do community EP it won’t matter. Most community EP is not VT, but device work, SVT, afib, PVCs, etc. you will get plenty of that at any fellowship.
3. u/docmahi [score=7, created=2025-11-03T14:57:07]: Zero I went to a mid tier university program. No patient or colleague has ever cared or asked

Recruiters might give your CV a second or third look, and some groups could see you as someone who can help bring in faculty from your home institution for things like proctoring sessions for new procedures
5. u/cardsguy2018 [score=4, created=2025-11-03T15:03:20]: Is this home program also where you currently live, work and plan to settle down longterm? I'll tell you that in my community group we do not care at all where you trained, in any subspecialty or level. MD, DO, IMG, academic, community, Brigham or North Dakota. We've passed on plenty "prestigious" applicants. The top most priority is whether you'll stay longterm and whether we like you and are someone we want to work with and jive with the group, i.e. fit. And you can bet the first place we always look at is the program in town. Hence my first question. Otherwise what's your plans after fellowship?
6. u/NC_Sweet [score=3, created=2025-11-03T12:16:37]: I had same question Deciding between two programs to rank for gen cards and not sure on how much prestige matters. I have been told different answers by my mentors!
7. u/joyntpain [score=6, created=2025-11-03T12:21:35]: Out of curiosity, what got you interested in returning to fellowship for EP?
8. u/supadupasid [score=6, created=2025-11-03T11:38:13]: How strong is your vt program? Is that what you even care about? I imagine stronger academic programs have that exposure. Scrubbing into IC is not helpful for you or a plus imo. Job unlikely will want you to use those skills. You probably would have to fight to do so.
9. u/Onion01 [score=2, created=2025-11-03T17:10:57]: Zero. Your skills and good reputation matter.
10. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=1, created=2025-11-03T21:18:42]: In academia, they will care, but forgive an unknown EP program if you went to a prestigious general fellowship. Outside of that, very few (if any) will care at all. Prestigious programs are sometimes better for networking nationwide. For local job networking, a community program is likely as good (or possibly better), so a good option if you have grown roots. Just make sure that you are going somewhere that will provide strong training.

They will teach you how to move an ablation catheter , they will teach you how to implant devices. However academic places tend to do a better job of teaching you how to think deeply. I say tend to because these are generalizations. They teach you to think about cardiac sarcoid on a patient with VT and complete heart block. You may see several patients during your fellowship. They teach you to get genetic testing on young patients with persistent AF without clear risk factors because HCM and TTN cardiomyopathy have AF decades before other clinical presentations. Some community programs do teach you how to think, but didactics at academic institutions are generally stronger. Also, going somewhere different exposes you to a different way of thinking and management you haven’t seen before. Just my two cents as someone who trained at an academic place now am busy private practice EP.
