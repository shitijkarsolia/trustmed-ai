Hello. I am currently doing IC fellowship at a very high volume center doing coronary endovascular and structural work. Job search is going okay but I have been contemplating if it is worth doing structural fellowship next year? I should be signed off on tavrs but dont know if it will be enough for complicated cases/ alternate access etc. Any advice?

At hospitals large enough to have a structural program already you will want the fellowship to help horn in on the volume. If you want to start a structural program from scratch you will want the extra experience of the fellowship. If you want to go somewhere where other people already own TAVR and want to do it without the fellowship it will be easier for them to kind of block you out

If you can't find a job then I would do the structural year - having access to some of the newer procedures (Triclip etc, valve modification etc.) I think does make you more marketable. But I wouldn't give up a solid job offer to do the year
