Hi All! Current IM intern here at an academic program thinking about cardiology. I am relatively research heavy and interested in informatics and operations type academic work, wanting to stay in academia. My institution and I know other big academic places are requiring level 3 echo now to sign reports, so I was wondering what jobs at these types of places look like if you don't do an advanced imaging year? I see faculty members are hired without it, but are you just doing clinic and inpatient consults while someone else reads your echos then? Is that a career path that they would hire for if you can't contribute to reading imaging? Thanks for your input!

You probably won’t be main professor track, unless the reason you don’t read echo is that you are a sub specialist in something else. Personally i dont understand why anyone takes these pseudo academic jobs. Just go private. But if you are dead set on proper academics, you’ll need to conform to arbitrary rules like this.

A fellowship is for those interested running an echo program and/or research. I like how another user put it… you have to follow these arbitrary rules for academia

5. u/wannaberesident [score=2, created=2025-11-08T22:50:40]: Very few academic centers require level 3 echo to read. Most of them are located in Northeast and California, most top 10 academic centers won’t require that - a lot of them struggling to find non-invasive folks anyway. Quite a few of these same programs also make you do an imaging fellowship to consider you in the reading pools so a level 3 in your third year kind of arrangement won’t work either. Without reading echo, honestly you’d be a glorified PCP. Personally I have hard time understanding why people take these jobs, extra 1 or some of the same institutions require you to so 2 years of imaging fellowship then you end up with a position paying barely half your PP co-fellows make. If you are dead set on academia then you have to conform by these rules as others said unfortunately.
