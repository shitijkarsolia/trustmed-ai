===============================================================================

Hey guys, I am a second year fellow currently at a solid mid to maybe low-mid tier academic program. Just wanted to pick everyone’s brains as far as how much fellowship name affects things like job prospects/fellowship opportunities? I’ve been leaning towards EP since the beginning but have been having second thoughts/potentially might go towards general with imaging focus. Any help/insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I'd say don't do procedural speciality (EP or IC) unless you really would not enjoy doing general. General cardiology seems to be a really hot market now and the compensation is not much different compared to procedural specialities. Less stress and potentially better lifestyle. For me, I ended up going with IC because I love the IC procedures (most of the times short with immediate impact) and long hours of standing in lead during EP procedures was not fun for me. But also I wanted to be able to practice general and imaging (mainly echo and nuclear) if I wanted to, and IC (as opposed to EP where you'll likely lose general skills) would allow me to do that. This is just my prescriptive.

None of it will affect your job prospects except at higher academic institutions Only do a procedural fellowship if you enjoy it and don't find it stressful else it won't be worth it, and it won't likely be worth it money wise. Lifestyle though EP can be excellent. With a good support NP you can be lab only, do a few cases, and then home at a reasonable time. Minimal call. Etc

4. u/Watchmaker2014 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T19:15:14]: The experience I see and just look at where the interventional fellows and ep fellows come from - even at the top tier academic programs you see ep and ic ellows from what one might consider “low-mid tier” academic programs. It’s just not competitive after general fellowship. So job prospects are good and cyclical.
5. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T08:44:15]: Doesn't matter. I know folks from no-name programs end up at big name IC/EP programs. Our group doesn't care where you trained. Don't worry about your subspecialty, many fellows change their mind anyway.
