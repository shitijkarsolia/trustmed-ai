Hello everyone! I’m a general cardiology fellow planning to pursue either interventional cardiology or electrophysiology. I wear eyeglasses and cannot tolerate contact lenses. I would greatly appreciate any recommendations for lead glasses that can be worn over my regular eyeglasses and provide good radiation protection. Thank you so much!

I wear contacts so I was looking at the regular radiation glasses, but they have plenty of models that fit over eyeglasses as well. I work with a few ICs and EPs that either have lead glasses with prescription lenses or prescription eyeglasses with leaded lenses, but I don't have any insight into the pros and cons of either.
