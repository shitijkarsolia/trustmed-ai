===============================================================================

**Hello everyone!** For those going into cardiac EP, is it worthwhile to pursue the echo board? I’m entering a 2+2 EP pathway, which makes my schedule much tighter than the 3+2 route if I also try to obtain the echo board. Meeting the COCATS II requirements would take several months away from my EP training, limiting my exposure compared to others on the 3+2 track. Most general cardiologists I’ve spoken with recommend getting the echo board, while all EP attendings and EP fellows I’ve talked to think it’s not worth the time and effort. However, that maybe because I’m at an academic institution where EP doctors typically don’t read echos or perform TEEs. Both sides make good points, so I’d love to hear others’ perspectives—especially from those who have faced this decision before. For those who obtained the echo board and went into EP—was it beneficial in the long run? Would you recommend getting it? For those who did **not** get the echo board and pursued EP— do you feel it wasn’t worth the significant time and effort required? Deeply appreciate your input!

You have better things to focus on and no EP job that I’ve seen is going to have you read echos. There are some jobs with general cards call, but even then, don’t need to be echo boarded. Focus on general boards and learning EP.
2. u/FIRE_CHIP [score=8, created=2025-11-11T13:15:42]: Nope. Didn't get asked on a single interview if I were taking or not and I don't think anyone will ever care. Only know a couple ep fellows who actually took it
3. u/cardiofellow10 [score=9, created=2025-11-11T13:33:08]: Not necessary unless you have an inherent interest in it and want to test yourself. Echo is by the hardest exam ive taken and prob across all of specialties. If your practice will be doing ep and procedures and not reading echo then its not important.
4. u/noltey22 [score=4, created=2025-11-11T12:54:55]: I mean, it all depends on what your practice will look like in the future. If you wanna be a full-time electrophysiologist, then probably it won’t be that helpful. If for another reason you want to also have general cardiology/non-invasive be a significant part of your practice then maybe. But at best maybe. Very few practices outside of the academic world aren’t going to let people read echoes ( normal surface echoes and ) without echo boards. So the only advantage that I can see is potentially doing transesophageal echocardiograms. But if you’re already the proceduralist putting in the watchmen or doing the ablation maybe it’s really not that helpful. The real question that your post doesn’t address is what is your main concern about not being echo boarded? What are you concerned about missing out on?
5. u/Ibutilide [score=4, created=2025-11-11T15:01:11]: I strongly considered taking echo boards as a general fellow, but ultimately did not. I feel strongly that all Cardiologists should be facile with echo in order to be a good at their jobs, regardless of sub-specialization. Now, as a soon-to-be graduating EP fellow, I have no regrets. I took an EP only job with no expectation to cover general call or read echoes. I still look at all the imaging for my patients before a procedure (particularly pre-LBBAP IVS thickness, pre-Watchman CTs and pre-extraction CTs) to stay grounded in imaging and not run into surprises on the table.

7. u/Traditional-Twist-54 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T13:43:10]: Im Ep and took echo boards. For the most part it helped me w gen cardiology boards but overall I don't think its 100% necessary. Most ep jobs in the community require some gen cards call but plenty of people (eps) reading and billing for tte without ever taking echo boards.
8. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:28:31]: Echo boards isn't the concern here. That's something you can wait and see if you actually need when you sign for your job. Some places will let you read w/o boards. The question is whether to do level 2 cocats, which will allow you to take boards later. I'm surprised that you have a hard time fitting it in. IMO, it's the most important category to get level 2, at least for a clinical career. Not only is it high value but high volume, which can actually be a drag on a group. Is research and academics your career goal? Do you hate echo and/or willing to potentially limit your job prospects because you don't read echo?
9. u/FLCardio [score=1, created=2025-11-11T16:57:14]: EP here. Personally I enjoy echos and do/read my own TEEs and read my own TTEs. Most places outside of academia will prob still let you read without boarding but that may change and if coming in new they may want you echo board eligible or even boarded but who knows. My only hesitation in saying just do it is that it was the hardest board exam I have taken. I did a lot of echo during general fellowship and spent a lot of time getting comfortable with it so that may also be an issue if doing a 2+2 pathway but not prohibitive.
10. u/haripj99 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T16:57:20]: Practicing EP here - no.
11. u/ManufacturerLow1263 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T03:02:16]: Cardiologist in practice 20 years here: No, not unless you are going into solo practice and who would do that?? Spend your time doing ablations and devices not Echo.
12. u/creamasteric_reflex [score=1, created=2025-11-12T05:43:44]: No. I’m general cards 3 years out and didn’t take echo boards. No issues with reading echos. But also most places like others have said you likely wouldn’t really even be reading many echos
