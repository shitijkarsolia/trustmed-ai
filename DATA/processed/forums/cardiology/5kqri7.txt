===============================================================================

as a mod in this forum I will often browse just removing posts. Please dont post seeking medical advice. As a second point - if you see a post seeking medical advice - please report it to make our moderating easier! As a third point - please don't GIVE medical advice either! I won't be coming to court to defend you if someone does something you say and it goes wrong

1. u/Aiyakiu [score=17, created=2016-12-28T12:41:26]: Thanks for this. The last few posts I've seen have been laypeople asking for medical advice. I check this subreddit for actual information to improve my practice. &lt;3
2. u/kiler129 [score=13, created=2016-12-28T18:51:08]: People should understand that this is a subreddit for professionals. Unfortunately most of them aren't reading guidelines before posting :(
3. u/throwaway279914 [score=6, created=2023-05-12T05:33:02]: I’m a pgy1 resident who asked a question regarding NSVT that got moderated. I wasn’t asking for advice on my own ekgs I was looking into insight/education from experts in cardiology
4. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2016-12-28T19:58:04]: Appreciate this!
5. u/fishmakegoodpets [score=3, created=2022-08-26T21:33:10]: # A word of caution to the people that seek medical advice online from strangers: ***Being curious about your health and asking questions is a good thing, but seeking treatment for a real problem in an online setting is not a good idea.*** I understand that you are probably seeking advice because you're unable to see a doctor in-person or not getting the help you need at your doctor's office, but no online forum (no matter how official) is a replacement for seeking care from a qualified medical professional in-person. &amp;#x200B; ***If someone offers you a diagnosis and treatment plan without...*** &amp;#x200B; * knowing your full medical history (including current medications) *and/or...* * asking about your symptoms *and/or...* * examining you *and/or...* * running any tests/scans *and/or...* * adequate training to become a currently licensed MD, DO, NP, or PA &amp;#x200B; ***...take their advice with a large dose of skepticism.*** I'll write you a prescription.
6. u/Used_Diamond_1573 [score=3, created=2022-07-31T14:25:39]: I know this is old, but what if I just have a random question that is something I feel that I just wanna ask instead of spending 300 dollars to see someone..?
7. u/Local-Bat639 [score=2, created=2022-04-02T01:39:23]: Can you please describe how to give recommendations without violating your policy? Isn’t that part of the point of Reddit? Totally understand the “no medical advice” aspect; just trying to Hear from others and find out what has worked for them
8. u/No_Cardiologist_4473 [score=2, created=2024-07-08T08:22:18]: As someone new to reddit, I'm glad I've found this community of fellow cardiologists! I've already garnered so much insight into how others are increasing their workload efficiency
9. u/rr90013 [score=2, created=2016-12-28T22:15:53]: Good to know.... is there an alternative forum for heart-related medical advice?
10. u/Plenty_School7 [score=1, created=2024-07-28T01:39:54]: Hello i want to ask for Ejection fraction it comes in what increments for example if EF&gt;60% its above 60 but under what next value? Thank you
11. u/Aggressive-Guide5563 [score=1, created=2025-02-01T14:10:29]: Why can't we ask for medical advice on this community? I can't reach a doctor right now?
12. u/GuidanceClassic5951 [score=1, created=2025-06-30T05:20:50]: Way easier to say “talk to your gp”
