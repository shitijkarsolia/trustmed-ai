===============================================================================

So I was diagnosed with T2 about a month ago with a 11.4% A1C and ~260-290 fasting BG. Doc put me on 250mg of Metformin twice daily and I cut out most carbs. After 35 days I went for a follow up and my A1C was down to 8.4% and my 28-day rolling average fasting BG is 112 (test every morning and chart in excel). Is a sharp drop like this normal? Safe? Those who have experienced a similar drop or trend - is there anything I should know or be prepared for? Doc was ecstatic with the results so I figure I’m on the right track but google tells me a rapid drop may not be safe… For reference: male, 35 y/o, 155lb

So long as your blood glucose isn’t getting below 70 mg/dL when you check it or your CGM isn’t alerting you to a currently occurring low you are good. If anything, congratulations! Your hard work that you’ve put in is available for everyone to see!

First, let me address hbA1c. hbA1c, despite the common belief, does not measure glucose or average glucose. It measures the amount of glycated (damaged) red blood cells in a sample. So just rephrase the question: is it bad to reduce the amount of damage I'm doing to my red blood cells? Obviously not. Rapid reduction in glucose can aggravate neuropathy, cause temporary changes in vision that can last up to a month, aggravate retinopathy or, in severe cases, cause NAION, a very serious eye condition. Should you try to maintain high glucose levels and reduce slowly? That's a question for a doctor who knows your history. For me, I dropped from hbA1c of 10.6 to 4.8 in 111 days. FGL from 309 to 85. I did have temporary changes to my eyesight that lasted almost 3 weeks. That can be scary but I was familiar with the physiology before I started getting my body on the right track.

I went from a 12.7 to a 9.8 in 30 days and mine kept telling me how good that was. 3 months later I hit 5.2 and when I went in for that follow up, the entire office staff was waiting for me in the lobby with smiles, literal cheers and hugs. I happy cried for a good 45 minutes. So much stress left my body at that time. You're doing awesome! Keep it up. Let us know how you do on your next follow up!

6. u/uffdagal [score=2, created=2025-11-05T15:33:21]: Very safe and normal
7. u/Nightcaste [score=2, created=2025-11-06T06:51:27]: I don't believe it's directly harmful. It does have the potential to *feel really weird* as your body adjusts. This happens because of what A1c is measuring. I'm not sure about the exact specifics, but it's an indication of your red blood cells having a coating of glucose, like the candy shell on M&amp;M's. This coating makes the red blood cell unable to carry a much oxygen as it should. Increasing that capacity faster than you adapt to the change can leave you feeling lightheaded.
8. u/WeBelieveInTheYarn [score=1, created=2025-11-05T07:56:06]: To add to what has been said it also depends on what you’re doing to achieve those levels. My A1C went from 9.4% to 5.8% in a little under two months (August 18th to October 9th). My fasting BG is regularly below 100, and i rarely get over 120 after meals. I achieved this through a somewhat low carb diet (net carbs around 130-140g per day), medication (750mg of metformin twice) and lots of regular exercise, at least 30 mins per day and 2-3 more intense sessions per week. My results are very aligned to what I’m doing. If you’re not starving yourself or doing something dramatic or harmful, and your doctor is not raising any concerns, then I’d be inclined to think it’s fine. It also matter how YOU feel, because when you’re more healthy you genuinely do feel it.
9. u/Lucky-Conclusion-414 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T07:59:26]: &gt;s a sharp drop like this normal? I don't have the data to say normal or not, but its certainly common enough especially in people that are just being diagnosed. Your insulin response isn't great (thus the diabetes!) but you've still got some good pancreas function going on and making life easier through diet/exercise/meds is enough to bring you to healthy levels fairly easily. (not to diminish your work - its important, and hard! but later stages of T2 work hard too for lesser results.) You'll see a story here pretty much every day of someone recently diagnosed and with great improvement 90 days later. Its a good time to be tuned into any complication symptoms - especially in your vision. Generally these are benign, unusual, and temporary but should 100% be checked out if they occur.

11. u/clintCamp [score=1, created=2025-11-05T13:23:09]: I went from 10.7 down to 7.9 pretty fast when I was diagnosed earlier this year. Between medication and going nearly carb free, the first 3 weeks kinda sucked and I had lots of false low feelings in the first 2 weeks. I think that is the main worry. Once I got a meter after complaining to my Dr that didn't tell me what to expect I found that nope, I never really go below 100 regardless.of what I do so far.
