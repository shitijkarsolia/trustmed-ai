Hi all, newly diagnosed a month ago and have been reading all posts. I am just curious what you all consider a spike to be? For example, after I eat sourdough bread (artisan) my BG can go up 20-30 points after 45 mins of eating, but around 1.5 -2 hours PPG is back down to what it was before. Do we consider this a spike or a normal response? Are we to only look at 2 hour PPG? I know that eating carbs raises BG even in non diabetic people, but I am just confused on if I should consider this a true spike or a normal response to carbs. Thanks in advance!

For some reason I cant post a pic to show you my morning graph. From 95 to 129 amd back to the mid 90's within 2.5 hours. We all digest food at different rates. I've found i peak about an hour after eating. Usually 2 or 3 hours and im back down below 100mg. When I take a walk I can get it back down way sooner.

Does anybody else experience this - you go to bed and it’s like reading about 120, wake up around the same and then within an hour having to get ready for work doing other stuff only drinking water it jumps up to like 180 or 200?

A spike occurs in response to carbohydrates and proteins. Most people reach their peak between 45 and 75 minutes after eating, with the average being around 60 minutes. The peak represents the highest point your glucose level reaches after the first bite. A peak that’s too high can be a problem if reactive hypoglycemia is an issue, as it is in my case. I’m one of the “lucky” ones, so I have to keep my peak below 160. The two hour goal, measured two hours after the first bite can vary depending on an individual’s situation and diabetes management goals. For example, I aim to stay below 140 two hours after first bite because I’m working toward maintaining a normal A1C.
