===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with type 2 more than 15 years ago. My fingers are so calloused that i cant get any more blood from my fingers. Is there a different part of my body I can poke?

Also, you can poke the ball of the finger and the left and right sides, so at least 3 locations on each finger. So for me that means I can test 24 separate times before I have to use the same spot again. If you've already built up calluses that may mean a bit fewer but you should have a lot of locations on your fingers that should still be good to use. Note: it's a good thing I can do that. I'm fully insulin dependent and have to test my blood sugar 3-4 times a day. (CGM not practical for reasons.)

6. u/No_Pitch3328 [score=5, created=2025-11-05T14:22:47]: I got a CGM when this happened. My fingers would prick but no blood. It was so frustrating…..I love the CGM but it’s been a little scary since I’ve bled out twice 🥴 but it’s better than pricking
7. u/Lady_Irish [score=8, created=2025-11-05T14:05:38]: Out of curiosity, were you reusing lancets, or using a new one each time?

9. u/curious_shihtzu [score=3, created=2025-11-06T14:46:16]: Always found finger pricks to be rather painful Finally got a cgm. Much better Still use finger pricks to verify when cgm results seem erroneous
