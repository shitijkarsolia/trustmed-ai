Still relatively new to all of this. We wanted to see how I’d do with corn in my wife’s white chili recipe. It does have beans (but I’m pretty well versed in how the beans impact me). This was my first spike in probably a month. Looks like I’m going to have to chill on the corn (I guess I did have two bowls. It was good!) On a positive note, I noticed the spike and did a little 10 minute walk, and that helped a lot!

2. u/childofcrow [score=33, created=2025-11-05T20:20:48]: This is fine. You’re still within range. Again, everyone spikes when they eat, even non diabetics. Your spike is in range.
3. u/Connect-Lake1311 [score=25, created=2025-11-05T20:31:59]: Dude. I’d be over the moon for a graph like that. I’ve eaten salad and roast chicken today. I’ve not been able to get below 200.
4. u/Smworld1 [score=14, created=2025-11-05T20:29:09]: You are in the green zone. Eating causes spikes big and small. So does caffeine. Unless you are living in the 200-300 range most of the day, relax. This what happens
5. u/RedBirdOnASnowyDay [score=22, created=2025-11-05T22:22:23]: This is a normal result not a diabetic result. There have been so many of these posted recently. It's frustrating to see when others out there are trying to get their blood sugar below 250 after eating a meal. Congratulate yourself on a very healthy response to a healthy meal.
6. u/throwawaykfhelp [score=9, created=2025-11-05T19:45:31]: Corn is a simple carb like white rice, so this is not surprising. It's one of the worst things for us, generally speaking. Everyone's a little different, but some things are pretty much universal.
7. u/Educational-Guard408 [score=3, created=2025-11-05T20:36:59]: Throw some green beans into the chili along with black beans. Increase the protein and fiber.
8. u/DefyingGeology [score=3, created=2025-11-06T04:06:45]: But what did it do over time? I suspect it came right down again—that often happens with carbs, they process quickly and then are done. But even if it maintained for a while, that’s not high blood sugar, less than 150. That’s in the “normal” range even for a nondiabetic. I’d look at that and go “yay, I get to eat corn!!!” (But seriously, what did it do over time? This isn’t a complete graph with enough data to evaluate any meal.)
9. u/LazyIndependence7552 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T04:17:01]: 141 is still a good number.
