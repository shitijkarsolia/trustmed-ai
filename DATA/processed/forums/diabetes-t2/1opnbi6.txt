===============================================================================

So after hitting my ten yr milestone, I am in way better shape than I was. The only problem area I have is the groin, it never seemed to lose the puffy kind of look. I have stripped most of the fat with the rest of my body but that never seems to change. Anyone have success in removing it any tips

First and foremost, genetics are really important in the way that muscle just is. Some people even lack part of the ab (look up vestigial ab muscle) which changes how its defined. Second, is the amount of cutting carbs/fats. You may have to reduce it to almost dangerous/non sustainable levels. Third is the amount exercise to acheive it for some (without hrt/trt). Its massive. I acheived it but my motto is "core every day". Every day. Let me repeat that, every day. 100-200 reps of core. Every day. Final is dependent on how bad your puffy pooch is. It may be natural/healthy. If you are going for the swimmers abs, or brad pit from fight club, note that is not normal. If this is not what you meant by "the groin" ignore me.

The groin/pubic area is one of the toughest spots for fat loss since hormones and genetics play a big role. What helped me a bit was focusing more on overall body fat percentage and adding in resistance work for the lower abs and hip area. It’s slow, but it does tighten over time.
