===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I’m a 30-year-old female recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 9%). I didn’t have any major symptoms, and my glucose levels are now fairly stable after making some diet and lifestyle changes. I have a busy schedule (10 AM–6 PM), so I usually work out early morning or evening. Right now, I walk 10k–15k steps daily and do some light dumbbell workouts at home. My goal is to lower my HbA1c when I recheck it after 3 months, while also losing fat and getting toned. I’m unsure whether this routine is enough for good results or if I should join a gym for faster progress. Would love to hear from others who’ve improved their HbA1c and fitness — did walking alone work for you, or did gym workouts make a bigger difference?

All of your activity and exercise helps grow your deficit, but it's not burning as much as you think. It's usually over-estimated. The gym won't necessarily give you faster progress, but it will give you more options beyond your handweights. There's also a layer of social pressure that keeps you going further than you would at home, especially without distractions. To control your diabetes, it sounds like you're doing what you should. You're making lifestyle and diet changes, and you're getting more activity than people who don't have diabetes.

I had to do the daily walk route because it fit into my life - wife gets home at 4:40 and we do a 40 minute loop catching each other up on our day and talking about plans. The gym was always an added activity that I could find reasons not to do. With huge diet changes and walking 5 days a week I drop my A1C from 9.8% to 4.8% and my weight from 240# to 160#. That’s all great and all, but I’ve held those numbers for a year now with daily walks and super low carb/ nutrient dense food (no meds, no supplements).

You can get free trials of either Libre or Dexcom to get a window into what you are eating and how it is affecting you. Taken from my personal experience working out and exercising is huge in lowering your BS numbers. A day of working out will keep my numbers low for several days afterwards. The key is to workout for a full 60 minutes, otherwise a shorter workout will actually cause your numbers to rise, not fall. A 10 to 15 minute walk 30 to 60 minutes after meal is also huge and blunts the spike from a meal. It won't stop a rise completely, but it does wonders. I have learned all this from months on a CGM, which like I said was huge in helping me manage my T2D instead of flying blind.

5. u/Thesorus [score=3, created=2025-11-06T09:30:56]: imo, you already do a lot of exercises. (10k-10k steps is a lot by normal standards) check (improve/optimise) your diet now.
6. u/Bluusoda [score=3, created=2025-11-06T11:03:15]: If you’re already doing that, I bet diet is your biggest enemy. Get a CGM for a bit and you’ll see exactly what’s working and what’s not working .
7. u/Ok_Performance3004 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T11:55:20]: You haven't included a very important piece of info - are you on any meds? 9.0 is pretty high.
8. u/Competitive-Fee2661 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T12:00:38]: Diet was most important in lowering my A1c and exercise helped me with overall health (physical and mental). I wasn’t able to lower it without medication, but the trifecta has kept my glucose in check).
9. u/ElectronicHold7325 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T12:29:29]: What i do: daily walks with additional weights in a bagpack =&gt; rucking.
10. u/stuck_behind_a_truck [score=3, created=2025-11-06T13:56:37]: Every newly diagnosed person wants to rush to get better numbers at their first checkup. It’s like we think that means we’ve “fixed” the problem. This is a marathon, not a sprint, so do the exercise that works for you now and use a CGM to see how your blood sugar responds. You can and will evolve exercise over time because it’s a new life now.
