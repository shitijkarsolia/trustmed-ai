===============================================================================

I just pick up my insulin not knowing the difference between the 100 units and 200 units. Until I got home and the pen is black and not blue. Honestly it’s my fault my new doctor asked if use the 100 units or 200 units and I said 200. I see the same doctor on the 19. My concern is the chance I have a bad reaction to the black pen. Can still use the black pen or do I have to leave it alone?

The only difference is you'll run out of the 100 unit pen sooner. That said, if you're still concerned go back to the pharmacy to consult with them.

Also, my pens are a different color, meaning they are different insulins. Very important to read the labels and check with your pharmacist about any concerns you may have.
