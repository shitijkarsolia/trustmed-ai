===============================================================================

The nausea from 2000mg Metformin plus 10mg Jardiance is absolutely brutal. Don't think anything I eat stays within my body. Been sequencing meals. Protein Fiber Fat Carbs. My LDL particle size is also off the charts. We are vegans, so there is no meat in the mix. The only real carbs are from Quinoa.

2. u/Pale-Cauliflower2737 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T17:54:31]: Pair fiber and protein with your carbs!
3. u/Zeus783 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T17:38:44]: Try Fiber, Proteins, Carbs.... Seems to work better for me 🤷

I’ve also had a gastric bypass so my rerouted digestive tract causes so pretty high spikes. But now on Mounjaro and I’m amazed at how quickly my spikes come down. Look at your in range report. That one spike is not anything to panic about. It’s going to happen from time to time. If you are generally in range you likely will be fine.
