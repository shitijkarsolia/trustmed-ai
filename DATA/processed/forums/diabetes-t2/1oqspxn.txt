===============================================================================

So I've never seen anything close to this before and have no idea what's causing this. Last night I ate a meal I've had several times before this to decent BG control. Par boiled rice, avocado, kimchi cucumbers and thawed poke style tuna from Costco. Its always been an easy sugar friendly meal for my wife and I. Even used my walking pad for the first time and walked for ever 30 minutes after. After the walk I had 2 handfuls of Costco trail mix which maybe had 4 m&amp;ms total. I noticed the longer rise last night before bed which never happens so I chugged about a liter or water and decided to do another workout (squats, sit ups and push ups) before bed in the hopes of dropping it and it just made it go above 12. I know this happens depending what you eat before bed especially but I thought I did it all right. I took my meds with dinner (1000 mg metformin) and worked out with a fairly balanced meal im familiar with. If there's any decent advice for what to do or what could cause this id really appreciate it

1. u/CopperBlitter [score=9, created=2025-11-07T05:30:59]: Two possible things come to mind: 1. The rice, even though parboiled, is generally not a good choice for a diabetic. I see exactly the same pattern in my sugar levels when I eat it. Protein, fat, and fermented foods help offset it, but can only do so much. 2. Any packaged or prepared foods can have unexpected ingredients, and large chains can change manufacturers and/or ingredients at any time. You have to read the ingredient list every time you buy it. They may have started adding sugar or maltodextrin. EDIT: I just noticed you also had trail mix, which is another food that diabetics should avoid. It's not just the M&amp;Ms. The dried fruit in it is full of sugar. I have found that the Omega 3 trail mix impacts me less, but still needs to be heavily moderated.

3. u/Arkasol [score=2, created=2025-11-07T05:23:03]: Trail mixes are notorious for this sort of stuff for me - I look at some low carb protein shakes to substitute post work out :) - exercise can also increase BG in the short term remember.

5. u/CageMom [score=2, created=2025-11-07T08:40:13]: If u mean the Kirkland trail mix with m &amp; ms, raisins are pure sugar bombs; and agree with others on the rice.

Watch what happens .. so why it's steadily at that range . My guess is your laying on it... Ur good on what your eating man.. you should see what I eat . I changed my diet at first ... But noticed it would go mad low.. like 3 and lower . So I had to eat more and stuff . To the point I noticed I didn't really change anything... Except my pop intake.. that used to be like a few bottles a day 4 tops .. the 700ml skinny long bottles ... But that's my guess tho .. hope you figure it out and feel better .. gets easier.. then again I've only found out I had type 2 not even a year yet
