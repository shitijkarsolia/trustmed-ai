===============================================================================

I’m honestly so happy I’m not even sure how I feel. Back in July I unexpectedly found out I was diabetic after finding a high amount of sugar in my urine and being urged to go to the ER for immediate bloodwork. I’ve been put on 5mg of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) the last month or so and have been keeping myself active between my walking commute and my post-dinner walks (aka my hot girl walks). I cut down carbs as much as possible, granted my dietitian told me 20g or less for main meals and managed to lose about 20 pounds in about 3 months. Admittingly, being put on medication had allowed me to be a little more lenient with myself but I still watch carbs and sugar intake. I’ve learned from both my doctor and dietitian that restricting myself from foods that I love is not the answer. Allowing myself to have things I love like ramen every blue moon is ok, and this has helped my mental health so much. When I was first diagnosed I was having constant mental breakdowns. I felt like I couldn’t handle this diagnosis, despite being told a 7.6 isn’t horrible. But knowing how far I’ve come in such a short time, makes me think I can really do this for the long run. It’s not going to be all positive, and as my dietitian told me, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. But my point is, I wanted to share my progress to show that things *do* get better, even when you think they won’t.
