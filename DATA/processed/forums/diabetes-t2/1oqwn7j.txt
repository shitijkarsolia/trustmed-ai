===============================================================================

I have been managing my health since Feb this year. Went low carb, mainly plant based diet, brisk walk 30 mins a day for 5 days a week, lift weights, etc. my blood test showed progress so the doc wanted me to continue with exercise and diet. He wanted me to keep it up and no meds. HBA1c went from 11 to now 6.2 I’m proud of my effort. I really am. It’s November. I’m tired. My liver enzymes are so high I’m off supplements and detox tea. My fasting sugar fluctuates when my routine is off. I decided to see an endocrinologist for more professional guidance and I’m ready to start meds. I have been scared to eat (often keeping my carbs at 20g for brekkie and lunch, carb free dinner) and I hope the meds can help stabilise my sugar levels and give me room to eat some normal food (pasta, sourdough bread, etc). Just venting here. Thank you for reading.

I started Mounjaro in April and it has been a total game changer. My A1C went from 8.0 to 5.0. I eat a strict keto diet and exercise daily. T2D is progressive, so it stands to reason that meds are needed eventually. Nobody needs to know about it if you don't want to share that info.

Plus, they'll make you healthier as well. It's much easier to keep your good habits when you have wiggle room and can have some pasta and a slice of breads, etc. Also, not sure about you but for my wife and I sourdough barely touches our blood sugar. I mean we can't go eating a whole loaf but a thick slice of real sourdough barely touches our readings.

The good thing is you might not have to stay on them forever and you can get a cgm if you end up on insulin. I bet they advise some sort of long lasting insulin. I was on 30u of Lantus once a day at first. I found out in January. 12.7 a1c. My glucose was in the high 900's. DKA and a 4 day ICU stay. With an immediate change in diet and started getting in as many steps a day as a could. Eventually working up to 20 to 25k steps 5 days a week. Plus 3 fast and 1 long lasting insulin shots a day and 2000mg of metformin. I brought my A1c down to 9.8 in 30 days. 90 days later I had a 5.2 a1c. Resting 98. Came off the fast acting at that time. 90 days later. Another 5.2 and dropped the long lasting and stepped down to 1000mg of metformin. About 6 weeks later. I was going hypo just from the Metformin and excerise. So we stopped that. The more you keep the healthy lifestyle the more your body can heal as much as it can. You seem to be in a situation where you could potentially do what ive done. Maybe not but finding the right combination will be worth it in the long run. I'm making a big assumption with this next thougt. So I apologize in advance if Im wrong. The title of this saying, "You're ready". Took me as, you didn't want to take meds and have come to see a need. It takes a lot to admit they need meds from some and if that is you. Congratulations for making a hard decision. I would only suggest more cardio. A 30 minute brisk walk might get you around 2k steps, give or take. Depending on your stride. I personally take a 30 minute walk 3 times a day. 5 days a week. One in the morning before work. One right after work and o e after dinner. With just normal moving around each day that gets me around 12 to 15k a day. For me personally. I got much better overall results with mostly cardio. Walking, kayaking. Bike rides. I eat a lot of protein to maintain muscle mass. 100 grams or more a day. Thats just my .02 though. You do what works for you

I was super bummed out and upset at first, but it’s been totally fine. No negative side effects no reactions. It’s really not a big deal. I’m making similar changes to the ones you have made! Feeling better!
6. u/IllegalMigrant [score=1, created=2025-11-07T21:41:36]: I take metformin and recently began taking Jardiance and Rybelsus as well as using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). They help with A1C to some amount (I wish I had just used CGM before taking the new drugs to see how much that alone changed it due to making me eat better) but unfortunately don't get you to where you can eat close to the carbs of a normal person. I have always wanted to avoid insulin but I am going to talk to the doctor about that in the future. It can cause problems going too low in blood sugar but a CGM with an alarm can help that. I would like to know if using insulin can allow a type 2 diabetic to eat a plate of spaghetti. Or half a plate.
7. u/HedwigGoesHoot [score=1, created=2025-11-09T07:50:58]: No shame in meds. I believe my meds allow me to make healthy choices about my food and still enjoy a few carbs in motivation. You’ve done so well! If you’re in Canada, look up the lifestylerx program. It’s covered in ON and BC. I was so scared to eat anything right after my diagnosis. I started the three month program about 4 weeks after and it helped me understand so much. Keep up the great work!
