===============================================================================

I have PCOS, am obese, and have family history, so I know this shouldn’t come as a surprise, but I’m feeling such a whirlwind of emotions right now. I went for a surgical consultation regarding another issue and was given an order sheet for a ct scan. There’s a sheet with my ongoing medical conditions, and it says “Diabetes mellitus type II, controlled.” Literally nobody told me about this, and I don’t know how or when it was found or why no one thought to say anything at all to me. I haven’t changed my diet or monitored my blood sugar. I have no clue what to do.

Increased IR is the metabolic problem at the heart of Type 2 DM. There are multiple reasons it might appear on your paperwork by surprise, but most are legit. Insurance won't pay for certain tests without that dx in the record. The doctor you're referred to needs to see it on the list of problems. Stuff like that. Whether you have the label or not, you have the body type. What you do now is control carbs in a level-headed manner, and take a 15 min brisk walk 3 times a week. That level of exercise is proven to reduce IR and depression and heart risk. Get a dog to walk, and feed him your bready parts.

If there is an a1C test there, that will tell you if you are diabetic or not. Regardless of what the chart says. Below 5.7 not diabetic 5.7 to 6.4 Pre-diabetic 6.5 or above Diabetic

With that said, over half of pcos folk end up with diabetes before they are 40. It is not the end of the world, talk to your doctor and ask why and if you end up with a new diagnosis, there are ways to take care of yourself. (Metformin is also magic as someone with pcos and family history too, like serious magic!)

You can absolutely avoid long-term problems as long as you take control. You might find this video helpful. The creator talks about when she was initially diagnosed and how she dealt with that anxiety. She has other videos on using a CGM for glucose management and using Mounjaro for her A1C. https://youtu.be/0pn0AxCPnj8?si=5qyqKeMMSmo_s-8R
