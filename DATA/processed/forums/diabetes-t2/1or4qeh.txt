Any smart bio-guy/girl her who know why the BS stays up for so long when u start becoming diabetic? And now after 1 year almost of treating it it almost always goes up then droppes back. Why was the reason it was stuck before? Full liver? Insulin resistance?

I saw the improvement you saw only after i started on metformin and jardiance.. Metformin causes inhibition of gluconeogenesus (cuts down the conversion to glucose), and jardiance helps the body expel excess blood sugar via urine. So, does your treatment include any such medications? Then, what you see is the result of that medication... each acts in a certain way to either cut down glucose conversion or to expel it effectively. If you are seeing improvement after diet changes, you are not giving your body the same type and amount of food to raise sugar as much as before. If you're exercising more, you're just burning more. In short, as far as I understand, all address the symptom, not the root cause. Would love to read expert inshights. Thanks for asking!
