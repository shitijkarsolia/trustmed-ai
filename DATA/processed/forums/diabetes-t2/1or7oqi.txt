===============================================================================

So...my birthday is 3 days after Thanksgiving. I feel like I can tank A (1) plate of turkey day dinner (in this case lunch actually) if I eat the veggies and turkey first and save the other stuff for after, esp if I combine it with a nice long walk afterward (and then maybe another plate the next day with a lot less of the other stuff). The question is how much can I get away with on my birthday? I'm not thinking like a slice of cake or anything (though I've heard cheesecake is doable?) but I really wonder if I could manage a french toast breakfast instead of the usual omelette I make. Just something to make the day special. I'm around 5.3 and my usual fasting range is 85-95. Would love to hear what you guys do for the holiday season

I feel like shit on Black Friday and New Year's Day but fuck it who cares, I want to live it up with friends and family not sit there like a sad monk or a rabbit eating leaves while everyone else feasts. Marathon not a sprint and all that. Ditto my birthday, though my birthday is in the spring so it's not as close.
2. u/LarryMahnken [score=5, created=2025-11-07T15:07:27]: My Thanksgiving plan is to fill half my plate up with non starchy veggies, a quarter with turkey, and a little of the rest of the sides in that last quarter. Get a little taste of the classic stuff, but not too much. See how things go and maybe have a small slice of pumpkin pie later in the day.
3. u/hu_gnew [score=4, created=2025-11-07T16:42:45]: They way I've been handling the holidays since Dx is I deny myself very little but I keep the servings of some things toward the small size. Something with potatoes, rice or pasta might only find room for a couple tablespoons on the plate. Cheese cake is a real serving and doesn't seem to push my number very high. My fasting number the next morning will be a little higher than my usual 100-110, which I what I use to track my management.
4. u/va_bulldog [score=3, created=2025-11-07T16:27:44]: I had just hit my goal weight last year just before Thanksgiving. I skipped breakfast and had 2 glorious plates. I still stuck to my basics, protein &gt; veggies &gt; carbs. I may do the same thing this year!

Have whatever dessert you like and take a walk. As far as holidays, load up on veggies and protein first then have a few bites of potatoes or dessert.
6. u/thegerl [score=3, created=2025-11-08T04:43:38]: I had my birthday this week, and I'm excited about Thanksgiving! A1C in the mid 5s consistently for the past year, fasting almost always 100-110. For my birthday I ate out and enjoyed a more filling dinner than usual with a palm full of rice (but stuck to the diabetic plate method) and then went to a Cafe where I got an individual date pudding, and enjoyed the heck out of it! Best part was no leftover cake. I did go for a half mile walk that evening and about two miles the next morning. I woke up at 130, but didn't sweat it. I was in normal ranges after my walk and all this week afterwards. I'll be using the diabetic plate method (half veg, quarter meat, quarter carbs) for my Thanksgiving feast. My diabetic nurse educator and registered dietician both say to celebrate with family and friends on special occasions, eat a palm sized portion of the Mac n cheese or whatever my preferred carbs are, but to keep dessert to a 3-4 inch (10cm) slice after a meal, and go for a walk. Last Thanksgiving I was at 150 after my meal and went for a walk. No biggie!
7. u/crazycardigans [score=2, created=2025-11-07T15:16:36]: I think you could eat a small portion of French toast if you have some protein and fiber beforehand, like some berries and a piece of sausage or eggs. But with your numbers, I wouldn't stress too much over a couple of holiday meals.
8. u/BlkBear1 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T22:02:17]: Holidays are the same as other days for me food wise. If I want something a bit more carby, I'll just have it, and factor in my exercise and less of other carbs at my other meals. If I want to eat, say a friend's oyster dressing, I'll opt for that rather than carby things I can have any other day. But for the most part I just eat the things I want for holiday meals and special occasions, and adjust accordingly the rest of the day/week, with food and exercise.
9. u/stuck_behind_a_truck [score=1, created=2025-11-07T23:06:20]: I’m considered “prediabetic” at 5.5 and numbers just like yours (85-95). I’m going to dive into my plate of Thanksgiving food like an Olympian. And then ignore dessert because I don’t actually like desserts anyway. It’ll be the hot buttered bread roll that gets me first.
10. u/Think_Psychology_729 [score=1, created=2025-11-08T08:30:37]: Since you are a controlled diabetic you have a better chance than most to do something special. I would say as long as you don't skip your exercise for the day you should be OK. Make sure your fiber and hydration for the day are on point. I limit myself to one special day a year which is my birthday.
