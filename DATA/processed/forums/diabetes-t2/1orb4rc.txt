===============================================================================

I work at an auto parts store. I have been managing my diabetes for a good chunk of time. I got into a serious car wreck back at the end of August, because my blood sugar crashed too low, I passed out, hit another vehicle, rolled my car and woke up in an ambulance. My BS was 25 in the ambulance. My insulin doses were adjusted down, and moved from NPH insulin to a shorter acting because the NPH stayed around too long. Fast forward to yesterday. I was at my work station, and my BS crashed, and the folks I work with noticed that I was “off”. They had no clue what was wrong, just that I wasn’t my usual self. I didn’t realize that I was critically low. It was just before lunch. The one fellow was just about to call an ambulance. He offered me a candy of some type and while I wasn’t much better, I was starting to come out of my fugue. The other dude told me today that he thought I might have been having a stroke. He led me to the break room to have my lunch. I came back to normal after lunch. These dudes are good solid folks, and I am grateful to work with folks who pay attention enough to know that something is not right with me. I thanked them profusely today for being good folks, and for looking out for me. I did also point out that if I am acting off again, to remind me of the juice boxes I always have with me. When I am like that I really don’t realize it, and probably need to be reminded to check my sugar and drink a juice box if it is too low. Thank you for reading.

If yes, you may want to measure whenever you start to feel iffy, right at the beginning, so you'll still be capable of taking countermeasures when a hypo is about to come in. Don't leave the meter at home. Maybe you can convince your doctor to prescribe you a CGM that can warn you when your sugars tank? Also, you may want to write these episodes down and show them (date/time/glucose level) to your doctor in order for them to make good decisions.
