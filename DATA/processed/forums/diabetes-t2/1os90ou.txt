Howdy everyone, I've been really into fish lately (tinned sardines/salmon/anchovies/trout and fresh salmon and trout) and I want to branch out and eat more fresh fish in different ways that preferably aren't all butter and lemon (I like lemon, but my bf isn't a huge fan when its the major flavor profile). I've really been liking baked salmon with a layer of hummus or dijon mustard on top and then a layer of spices, but my doctor said to not eat too much salmon since it's fatty. I don't have a grill, so grilled fish is not an option currently, but I would like a george foreman type grill for inside.

2. u/Sidetracker [score=9, created=2025-11-08T20:42:37]: Why does your doctor not want you to eat "fatty" salmon? I've never heard of that before.

I have been trying to get back into eating sardines recently after a hiatus of a few years, and one of my favorite ways is to eat them on top of a slaw type salad made with just about half the vegetables being something pickled - sauerkraut, kimchi, dill pickles, whatever. Fermented and/or pickled vegetables are so healthy, and I really like having something sour with sardines to brighten them up. An old roommate used to make salmon (but it could be any filet) by sautéing onions for several minutes, then steaming the fish on top of the onions rather than putting it directly on the pan. It infused the fish with a caramelized onion flavor and she could still sear the skin side if desirable.

Fatty fish are rich in omega-3, that’s the fat content they have, and omega-3 is pretty essential for your body.

6. u/jamesbiker78 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T13:53:06]: I eat a piece of salmon every night 5 days a week with a salad
7. u/va_bulldog [score=2, created=2025-11-08T21:51:53]: I eat grilled salmon, sweet potato, and brussels sprouts weekly. It’s a staple of my diet as a T2D.

9. u/trustingfastbasket [score=2, created=2025-11-08T23:07:20]: Salmon! I put salmon on a sheet and surround it with artichoke hearts. Sprinkle the fish with kosher salt and whatever else you want. Then i mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley. Then i pour it over the fish and baked the whole thing. I just made it the other day, and it was so so good.
10. u/jimfear998 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T07:03:27]: Walleye meuniere. Certainly not the healthiest recipe, but definitely my favourite. Cook walleye fillets on medium high heat with a small amount of avocado oil, then when just about finished, remove from pan, add a tbsp butter to the pan and let it become golden brown. As soon as it starts to brown, remove from heat, add lemon juice, capers, and a bunch of chopped parsley. Add the fish back to the pan and let the residual heat cook it through while basting with the sauce. Delicious, in moderation, and won't spike your sugar.
11. u/Lucky-Conclusion-414 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T07:44:34]: I eat a lot of fish. make a relish of cilantro, mint, basil, and peanuts that you bind together with a little olive oil. Serve as a dollop on top of most baked fish - cod, haddock, swordfish, bluefish, monkfish, and yes salmon. A different take - soy sauce, fresh ginger, and chili flake. You can bake that one right on the fish. (I don't bake the herb one, they lose their punch) Simmer the fish in a store bought jarred indian curry along with some green beans and an onion. Most of them are very low carb (just coconut milk and very long list of spices) but read the labels. Also a milk and parm style alfredo with fresh cracked black pepper is great for baking white fishes. This would usually be a bechamel with some flour or corn starch, but you can leave that out.. it just makes it thinner but no less delicious.

You can have it on a salad with sesame/soy dressing or just have as it comes from the pan. I cook it rare - I buy sashimi grade tuna and cook while slightly frozen inside so it stays rare. Don’t recommend unless you get high quality tuna. Also great crusted with black pepper and served with a little homemade steak sauce (I mix sugar free ketchup and Worcestershire) Otherwise I love Swai. I cook with a little butter and just salt and pepper. I had it with a teeny bit of cornbread stuffing the other night. It was lovely. You can also cook flounder this way but I think swai is best. Can also mix a little stuffing mix with balsamic and olive oil, top the flat fish, and bake. Flounder piccata is also good but I haven’t made since the Beat Us diagnosis - usually I coat the fish with panko mixed with parm so that may be out now but the recipe otherwise is Beat Us friendly - broth or wine, lemon, capers, garlic, parsley, and a bit of butter
