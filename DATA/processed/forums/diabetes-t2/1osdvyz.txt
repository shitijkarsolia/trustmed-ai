Hi. So I need new shoes, got something cheap that looks okay, but my feet are killing me. I walk and bike a lot, I am not sure how much I should spend on shoes, I always bought whatever was cheapest and if it hurts I put up with it until it doesn't anymore (I went through a really difficult financial period of my life and now thing are getting better and my husband is really pushing me to take care of my diabetes) What is the normal price? Even if I want to really buy something soo good. I don't think I should go over $100 ( Australian dollar). I probably should get two pairs, like one for my walls and one for everyday use, but I don't know where to shop, kmart seems to be really low quality and still not cheap, I don't mind online shopping. Thanks 😊

2. u/Internal-Strategy512 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T04:32:39]: Hokas are amazing but they’re at a higher price point, usually around $150.
3. u/GoldenTortoiseshell [score=2, created=2025-11-09T09:06:17]: I found new hokas on sale at a outdoor store for $50 and love them. If you are on a strict budget try looking around the sales department of those kind of stores and see what they might have. Edit: clearance is probably a more accurate term.

5. u/PipeInevitable9383 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T08:14:18]: My feet have gotten wider???!!! So annoying. I had to up my budget to 150US cause I walk 3miles + at work on top of everything else. My feet hurt more now then ever have. Ive expand to online stores that have good return policies.

Doubt they’d be good for running though :( Benefit is they aren’t super expensive like running shoes. And very wide toes which is very important with my neuropathy.
7. u/jojo11665 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T09:57:33]: Hokas all the way. Wide toe box. I got metatarsalagia from walking on a treadmill in Brooks. It's awful. Hokas are the only shoe that I can hike in again or just walk.
8. u/ephcee [score=1, created=2025-11-09T10:39:47]: I used to put up with bad shoes too, for similar reasons. I don’t go crazy or anything, but I decided that I’m just not going to tolerate foot pain from bad shoes anymore. It is SO SO SO worth it to spend a little more money and get yourself a couple pairs that meet your needs. I typically try to have a comfortable sneaker, something nice-ish if I need to look professional, and something I can slip on if I just need to run outside for a second (usually crocs). There’s a tiny bit of trial and error, but once you find what works for you, it’s fine to just stick with that! For me I had to finally admit that I need wide width and can’t do a heel. You need your feet to be happy! Walking and getting around is SO MUCH easier when they’re happy. There’s no gold medal for enduring suffering.

I cry when I buy shoes for several reasons, cost is one, and the number of issues I have purchasing them is another. If you have arch pain, look into orthotics if they're covered by your insurance or by health care, literally life changing. Nicer quality shoes are around that $100-200 mark (in Canada, which has similar exchange to AUD). The shoes I normally buy are more than that, but I have tried on a lot of pairs by the time I give up and spend the amount I do. See if you can go to a specialized store to get them fit if possible, it will narrow brands down (I can't wear Hoka or Nike). Try a specialty walking shoe store or running shoe store (Pace in Sydney shoes up in a quick Google). The specialty stores, at least here, have people who know several brands better than the general shoe or sports stores at malls and many of them have solid advice. I hate runners, but have had to go to specialty stores for walking shoes, hiking boots, and ski boots. Better experience and results than the mall stores each time. Bonus points if they know a cobbler or have an on-site one who can help with fit, but cobblers are getting rare. Mephisto make good (but quite expensive, I cry when I buy) walking shoes that have kept me walking for about 8 years. Look at the weight of the shoe and check if they have replaceable soles, because replacing the sole has extended the life of my shoes more than once!
10. u/MajorMiner71 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T22:13:23]: You don't have to buy there, but go to a New Balance and use their foot/ankle scanner. I went to several and it was very consistent with issues I have. Gives you a better idea of size and a type of shoe in the sense of ankle or pressure areas. Use a string/floss/piece of paper and get a line from center of shoe heel to center of toe. If sole is equal both sides, the shoe is neutral. More on the inside of the shoe, pronation. More on the outside of sole, supination. Sometimes your foot issue can be you're wearing the wrong shoe for your feet. The scan helps with this. Any shoe you have which doesn't work for your pressure/walk style, get rid of it. So the cheap shoes are for men under 180 pounds and women under 140 pounds. You can get away with cheat materials they use on these. If you're over on weight (not asking), the cushioning, toe box, ankle box will be sturdier (obviously all brands aren't the same) to support the pressure you're putting on your feet. If you don't plan to buy several pairs, you should get a solid shoe to last a while. Arch support -- scan will help with your arch type and help you either pick a shoe or the right support. Very key, especially for people over the weights above. I wish you good luck in your search for a proper shoe. If you're going to spend $200 on a shoe that will last 6-12 months, spend the $200ish on (just my honest opinion) something like Z-Coil. The shoes last about 10 years (I get 8-10 including the laces last that long), sping/heel is easy to replace, they take 1/2 the impact out of foot strike so you basically spend $20-25/year for a pair of shoes. There are other shoes like G-Defy, but I haven't tried them or can vouch how long they last.

12. u/Flyingplaydoh [score=1, created=2025-11-10T14:28:44]: Unfortunately, shoes are a part of the "you get what you paid for". So you need to go to a runner store not a big box. Many in the US have what they call ifit not the video workout ifit it just measures you walking stride, how you stand - basically your feet standing in 3d mode. So they can determine what type of stuff is going on qith your walking &amp;feet. Like pronation - do you have it and how bad it is. Do you need a rise step. Do you walk straight or lean your feet one way or the other - like knee knotted or toes pointing together. What you stride looks and feels like. So after all that they will recommend shoe brands and styles that work best for your feet and activities. So for me hoka bondi or NB 880 worked for me best.
