===============================================================================

So, I have a formal event coming up and would like to put my dexcom G7 on my stomach so it's not really visible. I have seen a few people do this and was wondering if anyone has tried it. I know this may be a long shot but does anyone know if shapewear would trigger any compression lows? Thank you in advance!

I don’t have much fat on the back of my arms so occasionally I’ll do it on the fat of my belly to the side of my belly button. I feel like the readings aren’t as good in that they seem to have more “jitter”, but are still reasonably accurate. I’m a side sleeper so no issues with compression lows.

8. u/WaltonGogginsTeeth [score=1, created=2025-11-09T18:01:06]: I don’t know if it’s an option but I put it on my chest halfway between my nipple and collarbone and it’s great.
9. u/Roller_7349 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T19:26:11]: If you are wearing a fitting outfit, it does show. But otherwise yes I wear it in this location 100% of the time. Alternating sides
10. u/yekirati [score=1, created=2025-11-10T15:09:10]: I wear a G7 on my stomach all the time! I stick it a little bit lower than my belly button like 6 inches to the left or right. I also wear tight leggings most days and have never experienced a compression low from them. I just try and make sure the sensor doesn't sit directly under the waist band since that's the most snug bit. Try your shape wear on, sit in them, walk, crouch, dance, etc. see if there are any places that experience more pressure or tightness and try to avoid those spots. If you have a difficult time finding a 'peaceful' spot on your tummy then I've read that some people will place it on their thighs/quads as well! It would still be discreet and could also be worn under shapewear. Have fun at your event!

It never interferes with any of my pants, I don't accidentally tug on it when removing a shirt and it doesn't ever put pressure on it when I sleep. I love it.
