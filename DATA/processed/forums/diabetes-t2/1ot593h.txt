===============================================================================

My mom was recently told she’s prediabetic and has had to make a drastic change to her eating habits. She’s been pretty successful but has trouble finding easy “on the go” snacks to take to work. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

2. u/Kind-Ad-7382 [score=13, created=2025-11-09T22:15:04]: Nuts, cheese sticks, raw vegetables and (sugar free) dip, Boursin cheese and celery sticks or cucumber slices
3. u/friedpicklechip1 [score=10, created=2025-11-09T22:19:07]: I recommend buying a kitchen scale and portioning snacks into little baggies, it gives a wider variety to choose from of snacks that don’t come in a single serving automatically.
4. u/Joesuds [score=7, created=2025-11-09T22:32:30]: Little “meat sticks” or jerky if her sodium levels aren’t too high. Nuts like pistachios, walnuts, and almonds too! cheese sticks are great for a snack as well.
5. u/Successful-Call-6574 [score=7, created=2025-11-09T22:36:19]: Planters dry roasted peanuts. I get the lightly salted ones . A very good snack low in carbs and heart friendly
6. u/Sidetracker [score=6, created=2025-11-10T00:46:29]: Pork rinds or string cheese.
7. u/MagHagz [score=5, created=2025-11-10T12:57:23]: i’ll take a slice of ham and smear it with cream cheese then wrap it around a pickle and cut into little pin wheels.
8. u/MizzGee [score=5, created=2025-11-09T22:44:46]: Read up on all the keto tricks. Jerky, cottage cheese, cucumber, sashimi, broccoli and ranch.
9. u/chamekke [score=3, created=2025-11-10T01:11:06]: Crudités (sliced bell pepper, celery, carrots, cucumber, cauliflower pieces...) with a non-carby dip (my faves are hummus and tzatziki, but some salad dressings work well too as dips). Nuts, whichever ones she likes. Small single-serving cheeses, e.g. Babybel. If you're in Canada you can get Handfuel's [lower-sugar nut clusters](https://www.handfuel.ca/collections/low-sugar-nut-clusters) \-- the coconut pecan ones in particular are \*chef's kiss\*. Keto bars that are low in carbs (I like No Sugar Company's chocolate peanut butter keto bars, although up here in Canada they're as rare as hen's teeth!) ... bearing in mind that any goodie with sugar alcohols has to be consumed in moderation, otherwise there can be gastric upset. As she's prediabetic and not full-blown diabetic, she also has a little more leeway with nutritious fruits. Low glycemic index fruits like strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries are generally pretty OK. As a diabetic, I eat the occasional apple in slices, with a thin layer of peanut butter on each slice to slow down the sugar spike from the fructose. Apple + peanut butter is really yummy and also nutritious and filling. But it all depends on what your mom likes. Ideally she'll find non-carby treats that she genuinely enjoys.

11. u/david_fireman33 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T06:52:53]: Nuts should be her best friend, those are my go to and I am diabetic not pre diabetic
12. u/jadedjen110 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T09:35:57]: Carrot sticks and hummus are my go to but I also love almonds and pecans. Cut up a couple pieces of cheddar cheese and you have a perfect snack 😋
13. u/bridgebutter [score=2, created=2025-11-10T08:36:32]: Make sure the nuts are healthy. If it says has oil it may have been deep fried.
14. u/audible_narrator [score=2, created=2025-11-10T14:14:33]: slices of apples with peanut butter became my go-to dessert.
15. u/ShivanTom [score=2, created=2025-11-10T14:31:30]: my "go to" are Blue Diamond Almonds. they reasonably priced (on Amazon). they have lots of bold flavors (or just lightly salted if that's your preference), they very portable and shelf stable.
