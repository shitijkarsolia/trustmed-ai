===============================================================================

Got my first "low" reading last night. Diagnosed in July. I'm talking 750mg of metformin daily. I usually only test twice a day. Once first thing, then again at various time depending on the day. This weekend was different because I was volunteering at a Con and was forced to eat "con food". If you know you know... I usually start the day around 120 and end the day around 90. Last night I took my sugar before dinner and was surprised to see a 67. I took it again to confirm and it gave me an 83. Should I tose it up to a bad strip, or have I just unlocked a new level of Diabetes? How many "Lows" should I wait for before talking to my Doctor? My next appointment is in a month.

If you’re concerned I would just talk to your doctor anyway. Good luck!
