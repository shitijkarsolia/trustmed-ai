===============================================================================

From a medical standpoint im normal and no longer pre diabetic. Everything came out good a1c 5.5 c peptide, fasting glucose, live enzymes. Pancreas is normal. Yet, I eat chips and salsa and it sends me to 300 for 30 mins then 80 within an hour and a half.

2. u/Nearby-Brilliant-992 [score=7, created=2025-11-10T07:48:34]: It sounds like you’re diabetic. Controlled by diet so I’m assuming you’re insulin resistant. Do you take any meds?
3. u/jonathanlink [score=14, created=2025-11-10T08:05:14]: You’re diabetic consuming lots of refined carbs which spike blood sugar.
4. u/jellyn7 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T08:11:18]: If you like tests you could ask for a glucose tolerance test.
5. u/Gritts911 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T08:25:42]: 300 to 80 in an hour and a half is definitely weird. If I eat chips or carbs as a t2 and it spikes me to 300; it takes like an entire day to come back down to a reasonable level. I would get a new meter, and make sure you wash your hands and rinse them thoroughly before testing. Maybe some contamination is happening? Or if you are eating limited calories and have a lot of muscle maybe your muscles are just sucking it up quick. But you are still highly insulin resistant because it shouldn’t go that high for a normal person.

7. u/Lucky-Conclusion-414 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:59:33]: I would call you a well controlled diabetic. 300+ is a very high response in a healthy individual, no matter what you have eaten. But you, a diabetic, have some iffy insulin resistance going on and the insulin dump you get when eating the chips takes some time to work out the problem as quick as a healthy person. The good news is that you've got enough resistance left that it does work it out quick enough. 90 minutes is fine. You say you are no longer (pre) diabetic.. which probably means you made some kinda of diet/exercise/med intervention (good for you!) - keep it up. that's what keeps you going well enough to avoid complications.
8. u/SpyderMonkey_ [score=1, created=2025-11-10T16:48:07]: You could be onset 1.5/LADA. You might be in a honeymoon phase. I would ask for antibody tests. I was the same when i started. Good all numbers but bad A1C and big spikes.
9. u/ValkyrieSteed [score=1, created=2025-11-11T17:49:11]: I was in your shoes, too. Turns out I was diabetic and just managing it very well. Go to an endocrinologist that will do a glucose tolerance test. Otherwise, they’ll tell you everything is normal. If you’re AFAB and might have PCOS, like me, then let them know
10. u/Environmental-Top-60 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T03:28:50]: Get a new meter: get a CGM; get some alcohol wipes. Try again. I'd bet its a machine issue first. When that's ruled out, then yeah endocrinologist needs to weigh in
