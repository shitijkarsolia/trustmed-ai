===============================================================================

Hey all! I got diagnosed with diabetes type 2 maybe 2 or 3 weeks ago. My doctor said that it is possible for it to go away if I loose weight and maintain good eating habits. If all goes well I’m supposed to start ozempic injections before new year. Any tips on diet/food and exercise? I would greatly appreciate, I get a bit overwhelmed when Google or AI gives a bunch of alternatives and I don’t know where to start. If this isn’t a type of post to upload I greatly apologise. Thanks again! EDIT: I’m currently on metformin 500mg/ 2x day

2. u/greatlakesseakayaker [score=3, created=2025-11-10T10:19:17]: One of the most important things for me was understanding how this disease damages your blood vessels if not managed properly and the cascading health effects that stem from that. Also, if you have high blood pressure work with your Dr. to get that under control. Diabetes and HBP are best buddies and they work as a team

5. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=2, created=2025-11-10T11:50:03]: Ironically my diagnosis was the best thing that has happened for quite a while. I had been feeling sick and miserable so long it became the status quo I attributed to getting old. Of course my weight couldn't have been a problem: I had been obese all my life with no problems, right? But things took a bad turn. The camel's back was breaking. I had to go to the doctor and the diagnosis explained pretty much everything, but I knew I could do something about it. My suggestion is start with the basics: lifestyle. * **Learn:** First I devoured a book that really helped me understand the condition and come up with an action plan. I used every resource provided by my insurance, employer, and health provider system. Met with a dietician, a health coach, and a diabetic care nurse. They reviewed my plan, gave me a big thumbs-up, and I just passed my 1st year anniversary of diagnosis. Avoid quacks who promise results based on just anecdotes without science and research to back them. * **Sleep**: Strive to get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. For me that meant no more sleeping to videos or movies, but playing instrumental music (or nothing). * **Meals**: Eat right. Don't go for "woo" diets that would make your grandparents shake their heads. I follow the general admonition "Eat whole foods, mostly plants, and not too much." I'm vegan so for me animal products aren't "food". I adopted a whole-food, plant based diet, use the "portion plate" and measure my portions carefully. I don't strictly count carbs or calories, but I am very mindful of them. No food is "good" or "bad", but I strive to compose meals with an overall low-to-medium glycemic load. * **Activity**: Get up. Get moving. When I started there were days I didn't walk even 200 steps, but now I strive for 8,000 steps a day (the "10,000 Steps" movement was a marketing campaign and not based on science). I got a bicycle and started riding for errands. In months I was riding at least 30 minutes a day. Moreover I budget at least 15 minutes of activity after each meal. Either a walk around the block or a bike ride. If I time things right and the weather is good I'll eat then take a 5-10 mile ride to the store and back. Or go to the gym. Those are the meals I know I can handle harder glycemic loads. Welcome to the club! The entry process sucks, but the knowledge I was able to get about myself, health, and nutrition will make it worthwhile! (P.S. I'm on Metformin, **1000mg / 2x day**... I win? 🤪)

7. u/Ikeamademedoit [score=2, created=2025-11-10T14:13:51]: As a spouse, my husband was diagnosed in April, we keep a daily food diary and track ever protien, carb and fat and we have a range per day we keep it within, worked this out with his nutritionist. We have removed most carbs, breads and snacks. I print off a booklet I created every month. Every meal is picked for the right fuels for his body and trying to enjoy what hes eating (as I cook every meal) and Im now baking super seeded, low carb bread, not that he has it often but it helps and Im even making our own icecream (ninja creami) and every meal begins with a salad, as Im from an italian family we always ate salads after our main. Im making my own salad dressings and using apple cidar vinegar. Im even making him chips/crisps using baked egg white and seasoning for snacks so be creative. We're trying a "whole food" approach and not premade/packaged with chemicals or boxed food that promise low carb. Picking the correct vegetables and fruits, increased some dairy like greek yoghurt. Lots of fish. We were also told to not do low fat as his body needs good fats. Throw out the cooking oil and start using a good olive oil. His HBAC1 was 14 and last month was 5.6. We know Christmas is coming up so hes hoping to enjoy and indulge a bit. Unfortunately hes been unable to exercise as much as he would like so he has swimming x 2 and pilates x 1 per week and just started light weight training to build back the muscle he lost. Weight training days his numbers are higher because thats what the body does so something to keep in mind and dont go animal in the gym. My husband has hated his diagnosis, he sees it as a personal failure so its been a battle for him and he still refuses to accept it. Even yesterday he number was higher than he wanted to see and he was a hot mess, swinging between anger and tears BUT, as I told him, stress does not help and when he is upset hes only hurting his body so we went through the day befores food diary and talked about some of his choices and switched a few things around. For example, I know if he has lamb for dinner his bedtime and next morning number is higher so we avoid lamb. When he is stressed or upset, I see his numbers go up so please try to work on that as well. Good luck! Edit. If you dont already have one, buy a food scale as you will need it for portion control and food diary data
8. u/Eeyore_ [score=2, created=2025-11-10T17:18:56]: Hi. I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was just recently diagnosed myself, on December 31, 2024, so I have less than a year of experience in managing my condition. But, that puts me pretty close to having been where you were in the recent past. Now, really, only you know what kind of person you are, what kind of habits and proclivities you have. So, what works for someone else won't necessarily work for you, and that's not your fault, that's just misapplication of a conditional solution. One of which you do not meet. So, December 31, 2024, an ER doctor asks me, "And what medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?" and I said, "Treat my what, now?" Then he told me, "Oh, your blood glucose is over 330. You have diabetes. You'll need to discuss this with your primary care physician immediately." And, then, when I got home, I, in my typically very placid and even keeled response, threw away every carbohydrate in my house. Then I went to the grocery store and I bought split chicken breasts and salad &amp; vegetables and cottage cheese and eggs. I baked the chicken breasts, prepared the vegetables, boiled some eggs, and I was ready to go for the week. I did that for about five weeks. On February 7, I started taking Mounjaro. Over those 5 weeks I had managed to lose 7 lbs. I went from 325 to 318. That was good weight loss. More than a pound a week. But, I thought, if this stuff is supposed to make me feel sated easier, with less, and full longer, I might be able to fine tune my diet to science the fuck out of diabetes. Because, here's another one of those "everyone's unique" issues. I'm a mathematician and an engineer. You can't show me a problem, tell me, "This problem is too difficult for most people to solve." silently challenging my capabilities, and expect I'm not going to analyze this thing down to the planck. First thing I did, I made a spreadsheet. You might be thinking I made a decent spreadsheet. You're imagining 3-4 separate sheets maybe. I showed this to a coworker and she said, "Oh, you just recreated MyFitnessPal in...a spreadsheet?" and, when she said that, I thought, "She thinks I shouldn't have used a spreadsheet. I should have used some other tool. What other tool would that be? Okay, we can't think about this right now, or the pause will get too awkward. What should we say to move the conversation on?" I responded, "Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted to hack it together in a couple hours.", to which she said, "You recreated MyFitnessPal in a spreadsheet...in an afternoon? Hahaha." It's here that I realized I misunderstood her first question's motive, and that she didn't have an opinion on my use of a spreadsheet to implement the solution, but that I would bother to implement a solution at all, when MyFitnessPal already exists. Why waste all of that effort? So I replied, "I know I could have downloaded MyFitnessPal, but I don't trust corporations with my personal data, plus, I get to display the numbers in any fashion I find interesting at the moment, linear, logarithmic, geometric, derivatives, integrals. I can see all the things, and it was interesting. I like to stretch myself on these fun tasks, and making a spreadsheet this sophisticated was a fun distraction. I learned some new tricks." She nods, and we go back to discussing the important topic at hand, the numbers in the spreadsheet. It's very existence is just an assumed precondition for this story to progress. We finish eating, and we go back to our meeting area. Oh, I think that might be important. This was at lunch in a pretty nice restaurant. Expensive, at least. Where I pulled my 16" laptop out of my backpack and regaled everyone with the intricate details of all of the metrics I am measuring and all of the projections I'm projecting, and the graphics. Passing the laptop around the table. Back in the meeting area. My coworker walks over to a group of our coworkers and says, "Hey guys, you should ask Eeyore_ to show you his spreadsheet." And someone said, "What spreadsheet?" So we sat down to a brief 30 minute presentation and narrative of my diabetes management behaviors. Everyone had a great time. Then things started to get weird. Everything before now is 100% normal person activity. Close enough to be within a single standard deviation of "normal" distribution. Because now I started making rules for my diet game. Why did I start making ridiculous BASEketball style rules? Because I created a fucking scoreboard in my spreadsheet, so of course I have to win the top score! And, the points were how much weight I could lose. How improved my blood glucose was, how improved my liver enzymes were. How improved is my blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, all-the-things. Okay, so, what are these rules? Some of them are just ridiculous. * If I felt hungry, I could eat unlimited vegetables, but I restricted myself to only 2 tbsp max of salad dressing per meal. This is an easy one. We'll start evolving off of this basic rule as we progress. So, one week it would be "This week, I can only eat unlimited amounts of carrots." Everything else would be measured out, weighed out on a gram scale, and portioned appropriately. Again, being a good scientist, I knew I needed a control group, or rather, some control stats so that I would be able to track what that unmedicated trend was like. So I began recording everything that would become relevant from the very beginning. First thing I did, even before I threw every carbohydrate out of my house, was start a notebook to take notes on my blood pressure, emotional state, energy, medication, perceived stress, food intake, bathroom frequency. Normal person stuff. The normal people do this kind of thing. If they can be bothered to stop doing and spend a little bit of time thinking before acting. So, I said things were going to get weird. Because I had restricted my diet to such a narrow band of options, I had to gamify every other aspect of the experience, because, if I'm not going to get dopamine from eating the same chicken on the same salad for the 12th time this week, then I need to get that fix from something else. Something with numbers, and a scoreboard. And, having read Atomic Habits (Ultra AI abridged version, but, I got the gist of it. I read a few of them on repeat a dozen times. Normal person stuff.) I knew that gamifying these small habits can lead to chaining them long term and sticking as good habits. Just like clicker training a dog. Except I was contra-Inception-ing myself. Fully aware of how I would condition myself, knowing intricately the workings of this psyche. Let's look at a simple breakfast rule. What are you going to eat for breakfast? Same thing we eat every day, Pinky, 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. Well, Eeyore_, here's the thing, you know, you **know** that you will eventually wear yourself out of managing to eat a food item if you eat it every day. You'll grow to hate it. So, we have to have some variety. But, that variety needs to be a surprise. I can't just alternate between 1/2 cup of cottage cheese one day and two boiled eggs the next, back and forth forever. Let's add some RNG to this. What will the RNG be? Well, how about this, Let's say you can eat two fried eggs over medium with some veggies if you get the jackpot, 2nd place is cottage cheese, 3rd place is boiled eggs, and last place is skip a solid breakfast, and have a glass of metamucil, and a protein shake. Okay, that rule seems a little intricate, maybe, but pretty straightforward. I don't see anything weird going on here. Definitely still normal person stuff. Normal normal person doing normal stuff. Jackpot if you can go the whole night without getting up to whiz. 2nd place if you only get up once, and it's after 3 am. 3rd place, you whiz before 3 am and 4th place you whiz more than once through the night. Because, for me, December of 2024 I was peeing 3 times a night, minimum, and I don't think I could go much more than 2 hours between trips to the urinal. And, now, 10 months and 10 days (9 months and 7 days with Mounjaro) into this leg of the adventure, I'm down 97 lbs at 6'3". I weighed 228 this morning, and, while that still puts me in the "overweight" BMI range at 28.5, that's far better than the 41+ I started at. I'm still losing at 2 lbs a week. I'm aiming for 195. That's 33 lbs away. I could be there by the end of January if I can maintain this pace. My blood glucose is very well managed. I aim for tight control, and I wear a CGM. Every metric of my health the doctors test for has improved to mostly the "good" range, with a few outside of the comfort zone, but not exactly the danger zone. Just the danger close zone. A few other peculiarities, I only allow myself 1/2 of an apple per day, or pear. I ate an orange over the course of a week. No more than two supremes per day, by volume. roughly 1/4 of an orange at a time, once a day. I aimed to consume 1,650 calories a day, and I am probably well below that many days. 3-4 days a week I might have to intentionally force myself to eat 1,200 calories worth of food.
9. u/galspanic [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:15:03]: I was told I was diabetic and that there are a bunch of great medications you can take to help with that. Then, I was told “you’re covered by Kaiser Permanente so none of those meds are for you and you’re basically on your own.” So, I started eating keto, changing my relationship with food, focusing on daily sustainable routines, and got things under control. My advice is my advice and not necessarily the advice for everyone. But, say good bye to the old way of eating. Don’t eat to feel good or cure boredom - food is fuel. Everyone gets finite pizza, cake, etc in their lives and I just burned through that allotment early. Set clear rules of what is and is not allowed, and stick to your rules. Plan ahead so you aren’t left in a position where you either go hungry and crash, or mess up your food routine. My secret trick that really helped compared to previous diets: no more sweetness in any form. Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you, but when I consumed them the actual healthy nutritive foods tasted worse and my carb craving never went away. It’s not about insulin response or the effects of artificial sweeteners - it’s about your palette. Since cutting diet soda, dessert alternatives, etc I haven’t wanted anything sweet or felt the need or desire to cheat.
10. u/DT114_469 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:28:16]: If you can afford it, get a continuous glucose monitor. There are a few available over the counter ( it wont be covered by insurance if you're not on insulin). It provides invaluable information on how YOU respond to specific foods. What's ok for some might not work for you. Even if you only do it for a couple weeks. Its really helped me stay on track. I wish I had done when I was prediabetic, I think it would have helped keep me from progressing.
11. u/kimpulsive2022 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T12:10:40]: When I was first diagnosed first week of September I cut way back on carbs - ends up I didn't have to be that hardcore My educator gave me this guideline: 30 carbs for meals three times a day and 15 carbs for snacks two times a day equalling 120 carbs a day. I think mostly I'm closer to 100 but I think that's a good guideline Eat protein and fat with carbs - if I snack on a cup of Smartfood (7-8 carbs) I add in some nuts. Nuts are funny to me as I've always avoided them like the plague because Fat Is The Enemy. I've had to adjust that mindset because nuts are a good snack for diabetics though never completely ignore fat content - its still important to eat healthy If you eat more carbs than you feel great with drink a LOT of water. And go for a brisk walk - even if its only 15 minutes Eat until you are satisfied - not until you are full Ideally if you have a testing kit when you eat something you question will cause a spike test 2 hours after that first bite of food - this is how I've learned what I can eat which, crazy, includes 1/4 cup of local farm icecream. Its less about completely limiting your carb intake and more about portion control. That was arguably the biggest thing for me to internalize I use Mounjaro once a week and this medicine has caused some of my biggest learning curves. Fried food - even a chicken tender on a big salad - makes me puke. Too much acid? Puke. Too much food in my stomach - and we aren't talking stuffed feeling, we're talking not very much food - makes me puke. Moujaro -and I think Ozempic - slows down your gastric emptying. When I do puke from whatever I did wrong on it I'm usually losing at least 3-4 meals (dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner). I doubt everyone's experiences are the same but nausea is a common Mounjaro side effect which is why I really wanted to mention this.
12. u/jimfear998 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T12:20:07]: Hey! Welcome and sorry that you had to join the club! Honestly, my reaction was self pity, and hatred at least for a few days, but it did fuel me to create goals for myself. So while I wouldn't recommend the self loathing bit, I definitely would recommend creating attainable and measurable goals, both short and long term. Food, I'd say, YMMV, but make sure you can stick with your plan of attack, and again, measure your changes. If things aren't working, adapt and adjust. I went from super strict keto, to low carb, and now to lower carb but higher fibre, and lower sat fats. This changed as my numbers (A1c, cholesterol, weight, etc.) did, and I'm at a point where I feel like how I eat is sustainable for me. Exercise, is definitely great, but find things that you enjoy to do, and will enjoy to do for a long time. Personally, I like golfing and I can combine my walking with that instead of taking a cart. I took up running as a challenge, and did a couple 5k races and a 10k race. I have some weights set up at home, that I use 3 days a week, especially in the winter, even if it's only for 20 mins at a time. Again, if you can find activities, or sports, or active hobbies that you can enjoy over a long period or even lifetime, the easier fitting exercise in your life will be. Modern medicine is great, and GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic are incredible tools if they work for you, and help you achieve your goals. Many want to be unmedicated, but it's essential that you do what's best for you, and don't get discouraged if a medicated path is what's necessary. On top of that, this community, particularly, is a great place to share successes, challenges, ask questions, glean information from, and even offer help/advice that you will gain over the course of your diabetic journey. The fact that you're here early on will be a boon to getting you on your way to your goals.
