I’m wondering if someone brews their Mott Apple Cider k cup and then I brew my coffee k cup right after if some of the sugar from the Mott could end up in my drink?

One Mott’s K Cup yields 8 oz and contains 21g of carbs, 17g of which comes from natural and added sugars. Even a few droplets should be &lt;1g. Unless you are incredibly sensitive, I wouldn’t sweat it.
