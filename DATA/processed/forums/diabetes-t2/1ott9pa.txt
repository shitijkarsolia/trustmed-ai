===============================================================================

The last few days I keep smelling Ammonia and like a cat pee smell. I don’t have animals so it’s not that but the smell is awful and I can even smell it on my fingers and almost taste it. I read some people with diabetes have reported this but wondering if anyone has experienced this.

If you have a high protein and low carb diet, that's where your body is going to get energy, especially during exercise. It's not dangerous but its also not optimal.. you're basically burning micro muscle tears and so your recovery time is longer than normal.

I presented it to my doctor who looked at me incredulously and in the After Visit he wrote he described being in disbelief. I felt so humiliated. But not anymore now seeing your post. I am actually going to send him a copy of this. And I hope he can read between the lines that I will never go back to him. I hope we both get healthier.

6. u/UNZIPT [score=3, created=2025-11-10T23:16:24]: Fifteen years ago when I was diagnosed T2, my housekeeper at the time, said my diagnosis didn’t surprise her. She said she could smell it. I didn’t understand, and I’m sorry to say I didn’t pursue it, but she did mention that in her second job, she was caregiver to someone who was a poorly controlled diabetic. I think I’m beginning to understand now.
