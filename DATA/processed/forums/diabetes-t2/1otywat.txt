===============================================================================

Hello all. I've started my weight loss journey a couple of weeks ago. I weighed 300 pounds then and also started Metformin 500mg daily to help my blood sugar even though my numbers are in range. I lost 10 pounds in a week but in that week I ate relatively healthy and walked a ton in Las Vegas (30+ miles in four days). Then last week I ate pretty darn good except for a couple meals and kept my calories and carbs low. I haven't weighed myself again since last week but I've had to have lost at least five more pounds. So in total I probably lost around 15 pounds in two weeks. Is this too much? I really want to lose weight to see if my diabetes can get better even though my numbers are in the normal range. Im super motivated to lose weight and want to lose it at a good pace and not too slow. I think ive had some side effects of losing this weight quickly. I think im more thirsty than usual. Can this weight loss lead to negative effects to my diabetes? Thank you for reading.

You will lose weight without effort and go through periods where you can't lose a pound to save your life. Keep up the healthy eating habits and let your doctor know about any concerns you have while going through this. You are on a good path by taking this seriously so good on you!

That said, weight lose comes in spurts and goes up and down (you will inexplicilty gain weight some weeks). Also, sometimes you can lose a lot of water weight. This might seem silly, but taking a large dump can put you down up to 5 lbs! So as a week or two, I can see that not out of the realm of possibility or safety to lose that much weight but definitely don’t want that to continue. The healthy goal is 2 lbs a week, maybe 2.5. I weighed 280. I’m 175 today. I lost an average of 1.5 lbs a week. It took me nearly 3 years but that 12 yrs ago. I’ve been 175-185 since. It’s a marathon, but you’ll feel great when it’s over

For my part, I knew nothing about diabetes and nothing about dietetics and I was lucky to have a good doctor who prescribed that I see a dietician: they both put me back on the right path.

You'll see comments to the effect that around 1Kg per week, around 2 lbs, is a 'healthy' rate. I read that online soon after I was diagnosed, but when I went looking for sources it turns out those numbers are basically made up, just something off the top of someone's head that stuck because there was no concrete research on the subject and so nothing to contradict it ('around 1 or 2 units of weight, or something, seems fine to me'). It's considered a safe rate but beyond that nobody really knows. Losing weight too fast may be unhealthy, but being obese definitely is unhealthy. It may be worth taking a good vitamin supplement or two and using one of the better food tracking apps like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal to be sure you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, including things like Omega 3 oils and so on. Also, don't cut down on protein intake if you want to retain as much muscle mass as possible as you lose weight. Don't exercise so much that you risk injury. Drink plenty of water. Beyond that nobody can actually tell you what is and isn't safe. Nobody has ever done the experiment of intentionally getting a group of obese people to lose weight very quickly and for an extended period of time while at the same time feeding them all the nutrients they need (apart from the calories). Without that piece of research nobody can give you a straight answer beyond 'around a kilo a week is probably fine'. Edit - the closest thing to such an experiment that I know of is the Newcastle diet used for Prof Taylor's Counterpoint study, which was a rapid weight loss diet for the purpose of Type 2 diabetes research. That was an 800 calorie per day diet and the most serious reported side effect was temporary hair loss beginning after eight weeks or so into the diet. If you Google 'Newcastle Diet booklet' you'll find a link to a PDF file on the Newcastle University website and all the observed side effects are listed in that booklet.
