# So my brother’s 50, always been lean but strong — broad shoulders, muscular legs, never had a belly. A few months ago, I noticed his legs looking real thin. I asked if he’d seen a doctor. He used to drink 4 liters of Coke a day, plus a liter of fruit juice, greasy foods, white bread — his diet was terrible. # Then he started urinating 4 times a night, foamy urine, mouth dry like sandpaper. I told him, “Let’s go to the doc.” His fasting glucose came back 13.1, so the doctor ordered full labs. My brother immediately went cold turkey — quit all the junk, started drinking only water and lime. His urine cleared up, the foam went away, the thirst stopped. But the damage was done. # Lab results: # HbA1c: 14.1 # ALT: 69 # Cholesterol: 5.8 # Doc put him on Metformin 500mg twice a day, a blood pressure pill, baby aspirin, and statins (20mg). After 4 days on that combo, my brother was exhausted — barely talking, no appetite, legs cramping, no energy. We saw another doctor who said to stop the statin — 20mg was too strong for a body already drained from rapid weight loss and no carbs. He also said the blood pressure meds were unnecessary since my bro doesn’t even have high blood pressure — it was just drying him out and depleting electrolytes. # A day after stopping those meds, he perked up again — started eating and feeling alive. # Now, here’s the problem: he’s still losing weight, even though he’s eating healthy. Doc said to cut the low GI brown bread, but I can’t — if I do, he’ll waste away. He’s hungry all the time. His glucose is still up — fasting around 13, 11, 10, and after meals 8.2 or 9. Doc says insulin could drop him too low because his post-meal readings aren’t that bad, but I’m scared we’re just watching him fade slowly. # Please, if you’ve gone through this — or helped someone get their strength back — I need some hope or guidance. I just want him to gain healthy weight again and get his energy back. # Thank you.

Lots of calorie dense foods like nuts, meats, cheeses that are lower carb. He can still have some carbs, but it just can’t be the bulk of his diet. Plenty in fruits and vegetables and whole grain stuff, but even things like rice and pasta are okay in small amounts and eaten in the right order. Most importantly, taking a walk or exercising after eating is important too.
2. u/darthaxis [score=5, created=2025-11-11T08:04:41]: Was he tested for type 1 diabetes? It sounds like he should get tested. The treatment approach for type1 is completely different. Consider getting an endocrinologist. If he is type 2 and is still uncontrolled there are many more medications he could add to metformin. I'd Try to avoid insulin, at least initially. Glp1- the older (and cheaper) glp1 medications don't effect weight much. They also have fantastic long term outcome studies. Sglt2- like Farxiga have fantastic long term outcomes studies too. Weight loss on these are minimal, and both have very modest post meal effects. I am not a doctor, I'm just some rando on the internet. Good luck.

I am really surprised they weren't more aggressive with an A1C of 13.1 though. My doctor had me ramp up to 2000mg of Metformin ER a day over 3 weeks and started me on Ozempic right away and I started at 11. So again, I'd get him to a specialist that really understands how to diagnose and treat diabetes.

5. u/ShivanTom [score=3, created=2025-11-11T14:01:34]: get a new nutritionist. eating well doesn't mean starving. eat clean and balance protein and leafy greens. fish, chicken (and eggs) and beef/pork. salads (go light on the dressing but if you must &gt; try to get some dressing from Primal Kitchen) and drink plenty of water. just hit [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) for keto staples.
6. u/Earesth99 [score=3, created=2025-11-11T19:33:43]: I don’t think the doctor meant that he should further restrict his diet by cutting out low gi bread. He means replace that with something that has calories - Nuts, cheese, avocado, etc.
7. u/cw7428 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T09:34:35]: I was diagnosed with T2D and my A1C was 12.9 last June. I was underweight. Then I started a strict low-carb diet, regular exercise including gentle cardio and resistance training, regular sleep from 9pm to 7am, trying to stay positive everyday. My A1C from my blood test in this October was 5.5 and I have gained 10lb of weight. I am 51 years old. So try to establish a healthy lifestyle then good results may follow. It does require discipline and patience.
