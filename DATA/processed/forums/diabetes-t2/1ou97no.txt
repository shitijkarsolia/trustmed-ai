===============================================================================

TLDR: I’m only 27, diagnosed since 22. I don’t see a lot of people in my age group with this diagnosis. The Shame is overwhelming. I was diagnosed with t2 diabetes 5 years ago at only 22. I’ve struggled with my weight and PCOS since I was 15. Both of my parents and all grandparents were diabetic. I asked my endocrinologist, please tell me exactly what I did wrong. Her response simply was “we don’t know enough about diabetes to say a certainty. Being predisposed via genes, hormone imbalance, and a lifestyle impact. There could be 10 women, in this room who lived as you lived and look the same as you, but with different genetics would not get diabetes.” But I know when people hear type2 they assume I am an egregious consumer of food and sugar.. Ever since my diagnosis I’ve been so ashamed. Since then I’ve done everything right, lost weight (70lbs), brought my A1C down from a 10 to a 5.7, I’ve even carried a healthy baby and continue to lose weight with a managed A1C post pregnancy. I wish there was a place that I fit into where I don’t feel ashamed or out of place. There are not many type 2’s my age, it’s hard to find any relatable creators or content or type2 peers in general. Have any of you felt the shame? What helps?

Of course, there's a genetic and lifestyle aspect to it, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. You're doing everything to get better. (probably more than most people around you) &gt;it’s hard to find any relatable creators or content or type2 peers in general. There are a few on instagram, but after a while, it's just gets boring or they try to sell you stuff. (more often, you'll see Type 1 creators, still a good start) I think the only one I'm still subscribing is "type2.diabetes.nutritionist" (Kristina Cooke)

The reason why you don’t see people in your age group when you were diagnosed isn’t always because they aren’t there. They just may not have been tested for it. I literally hadn’t had an A1C done in over a decade before they diagnosed me.

Skateboarding is risky, maybe you were tired because you drank coffee after 3pm yesterday and didn't sleep well, maybe you hadn't practiced in a few years and got carried away trying something you used to do all the time, maybe you are sort-of a show off when you're hanging out with friends, maybe you should've checked those stairs for gravel, etc., etc., etc.. But you probably wouldn't beat yourself up about it forever. It happened, it happens to perfectly good people all the time, you wish it didn't. You almost definitely wouldn't develop permanent shame around it, since you know that just because you broke your leg doing something you didn't have to do, even if you "knew better," that doesn't make you a bad human -- you're not an irresponsible slacker moron with a disgusting evil body, you're just someone with a broken leg. Even if that leg won't ever be totally right again, even if you might need a cane sometimes when it's damp outside for the rest of your life, even if you can't skate anymore, and even if you have to take Aleve every day, it's still not because you're a bad person. You broke your pancreas. Oops. You wish you didn't. Were there choices involved? Sure, but not the kind that only a bad person would make. It's not like T2D is caused by littering or murder. Lots of people make the choices you made and don't injure themselves. There might've been factors that made your injury more likely, okay, but it's not that simple, and we honestly can't process the world with a perfect sense of foresight and flawless risk assessment and avoidance. That's not possible, and it's not life. You're not a bad person in a bad body, you're a great person in a body with a broken pancreas.

I was so angry at times when I first found out. I was, like most of us T2's, over weight. Medically obese. Seeing others that are clearly Morbidly obese, eating and drinking whatever they want. Enjoying things that would send me back to the hospital. We may have helped it along, but it was more then likely just waiting for chance to get ya. The best way for me to get passed any shame was to get it under control. Lose the weight. Now days I love it when someone finds out im diabetic and they say, "You dont look Diabetic". I know it's wrong they think that way, but it makes me feel good. Lol
5. u/jadedjen110 [score=11, created=2025-11-11T07:40:56]: NONE of this is your fault. You're young, I was 32 when I was diagnosed (I'm 40 now) and everyone told me I was too young then. All you can do now is take care of yourself and listen to your doctor's advice.
6. u/Interesting_Berry629 [score=11, created=2025-11-11T09:00:50]: Girl. Do not be ashamed. I'm a 56 year old female, LEAN---size 0-2 and with solid muscle mass from intentional strength training and CV workouts. I eat zero carbs for lunch and hold myself to 1 carbs for the other meals. I cheat one time a week when we go out to eat. And still---my last A1C was 5.8 ON Metformin. I always thought I could outrun this disease by not being overweight or obese like my relatives with diabetes. NOT true. I have never ever exceeded a BMI&gt; 23. Ever. Yet here we are. You've done amazing, have dialed up all of your lifestyle changes AND grown a human. Be loud and proud.
7. u/Zeus783 [score=7, created=2025-11-11T08:39:21]: I'm sure I've seen a few young peeps with T2 around here. But even if you were the only one on the planet : no reason to feel shame 😐 Did you go out of your way to cause the disease? I doubt. Shame = people's opinion more important than your own.. And that's not right. Mind you, it could be people don't even care about it. If anything You should be *PROUD* of how you tackled it and managed to improve your numbers 👏👏 Love yourself! 😉
8. u/FustianRiddle [score=6, created=2025-11-11T10:22:06]: It's hard because diabetes is considered a joke when people talk about large amounts of sugary food. Seeing and hearing that can trigger an emotional response. And socially there is a lot of shame and blame passed on people with t2 (especially if not specifically fat people). But you said so yourself, you have a family history of it. There's a good chance with a genetic predisposition that the only difference between you being diagnosed with it now vs later is food or lifestyle choices. But there's a chance you were always going to be diabetic no matter what you did. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You have a chronic disease. You wouldn't shame someone with Chrons or celiacs or type 1 so why shame yourself? How to deal with other people passing judgement I couldn't say. I think the truth of it is that you're young and that kind of judgement means a lot. It did to me. But I'm 40 now and I don't really give a shit what strangers think about me. Think about this though - you're a mom now and how awesome is that?! How amazing that your body is carrying you through life even if your pancreas needs a little extra help! How awesome that you get to play with your kids in that body despite your pancreas! Think about your amazing body and how it's been working extra hard to keep you here and you didn't even know you were diabetic, and how lucky to find out while you're young and have a long life ahead of you to make changes and manage it before it does irreparable damage to your body!
9. u/monstersinmyshoe [score=6, created=2025-11-11T06:50:50]: I did things wrong and did not live healthy when I was diagnosed, there is a genetic factor also, but still. I have chosen to be conpletely open about it. It is part of me, and it is the reason why I do a lot of the things I do. It is the reason why I don't eat cake at your birthday, why I don't accept a beer when you offer one. It is far easier to just say I have diabetes, than to be seen as someone who always declines offers
10. u/lisavollrath [score=4, created=2025-11-11T11:16:58]: There is diabetes throughout my family tree, so I always knew I was at risk. I did everything possible to kick my diagnosis down the road. I ate like a monk, got off sugar and processed foods, exercised. And at 62, I got the inevitable news. My genetics finally caught up with me. Having an illness is not a personal failing. You can make every good choice, and still end up diabetic. You can make every bad choice, and not get it. Here we all are. How we got here doesn't matter. How we continue forward does.
11. u/goosetavo2013 [score=4, created=2025-11-11T09:56:17]: You should be so proud. With a diagnosis at that age and instead of dwelling on it and getting worse, you took steps to get better. I'm proud of you, so there's that.
