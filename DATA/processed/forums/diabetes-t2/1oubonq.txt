===============================================================================

Since my DX. I've done very well with my glucose levels. Brought my a1c down to 5.2 from a 12.7 in less then a year. No worries there really and maintaining The biggest issue I deal with on a daily basis and like today, by the hour it seems. Is my vision. Right now my glucose is sitting steady right around 90. Normal for me between meals. But my eyes just keep going in and out of focus. My Opthomoligist says my retinopathy is holding steady as of last visit, but. Its just irritating not being able to just see cleary 90% of the time. Even living between 80 and 130 97% the time.
