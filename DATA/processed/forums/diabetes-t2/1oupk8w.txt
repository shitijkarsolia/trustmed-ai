===============================================================================

Hey everyone, I’ve been reading up on **Dr. Jason Fung’s work** around fasting and Type 2 diabetes, and I’m honestly intrigued. I’m currently **210 lbs**, diagnosed with **Type 2 diabetes**, and trying to lose weight while keeping my sugars in check. From what I’ve gathered, fasting (whether intermittent fasting or longer windows like 16:8 / 18:6) can help **lower insulin resistance**, **reduce blood sugar**, and even push some people toward **remission**. But what I’m trying to understand is the *long game* — * **Does fasting work long term?** Like, do people really maintain lower A1C and weight years later, or does it plateau or rebound once you stop fasting? * **What are the effects of fasting over many years?** Does metabolism slow down, or does the body adapt well if you stick with a sustainable routine (say 16:8 most days)? * **If you’ve done this yourself**, how did your fasting schedule evolve over time? Did you combine it with low-carb or keto, or just calorie restriction? I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve tried fasting for 6+ months or even years — especially **those managing diabetes without medication** or reducing their meds along the way. Any lessons learned, pitfalls, or advice for someone starting this journey? Thanks in advance 🙏 *(Planning to start slow, maybe a 14:10 or 16:8 schedule and gradually build from there.)*

Low carb as well, so not just skipping meals. It varies I would think, depending on just how your metabolism is working. Try it and see.
2. u/Dgskydive [score=6, created=2025-11-11T18:35:07]: Great questions. I toyed with fasting, but never really have. My dinner is at 7pm and then 7 am for breakfast, but I always have a snack. Ive been maintaining a 5.2 a1c the last 2 tests. Down from 12.7. Lost 65 pounds like that also. No more meds. We are all so different though. You'll only know if you try. I was able to find a diet I can sustain that really worked. I personally think that's overlooked a lot.
3. u/SolidLava99 [score=4, created=2025-11-11T18:47:18]: Depends, some of us have aggressive form due to genetics fasting alone does not work long term, meds are needed long term
4. u/treylathe [score=9, created=2025-11-11T22:20:38]: Fasting works. So does keto. So does vegan. So does raw food, so does carnivore, so do a lot of different ones. They all have somethings in common. They all restrict calories and they all limit simple carbs. The best one is the one that works for you and is sustainable over the long run. And of course exercise :).
5. u/Bevkus [score=18, created=2025-11-11T17:41:52]: I love Jason Fung! Followed his advice. Went keto then jumped on the fasting train I was kinda in a hurry to see results. My a1c was near 11 at the time. My doctor said I need insulin but I refused. I weighed 225 lbs. I’m 5ft tall I started slow, a week or so of 18:6 which I found surprisingly easy. Then I moved to OMAD. After about a month I pressed myself even more. I did a two day fast one week, three days the next, four and a half day fast the next! The results were amazing. I was quite proud of my accomplishment. Wow four days without eating holy crap! My GP doc was zero help through the process. I was on tons of meds for diabetes high blood pressure rheumatoid arthritis cholesterol etc. when I said I was keto he was horrified. Said just keep taking meds and try to exercise a bit. Forget about mentioning fasting he would drop dead. My rheumatologist was a bit better as he was Muslim and supported me with OMaD I tested my blood continuously always worried I’d keel over with a hypo. Never happened. At first my BG would come down but still be elevated. I stuck with it and sure enough it went lower and lower while fasting. Just as Fung promised. Then I started to do some longer fasts but by this time I bought a ketone monitor. I was getting BG readings of 3.8/3.9 during my fasts but felt fantastic!!! My ketones were high, I was totally running off my body fat! My meds became problematic as I was healing. As mentioned I could not talk to My doc about this zero support. I noticed I was getting dizzy when I stood up. Dr Google told me to check Blood pressure. I went to the drug store daily for a while to check. Yep low. I stopped my BP med and felt great I basically weaned myself off all My meds by myself as I healed…reverse order from When prescribed. I went for a physical and assorted blood. In 4 months I lowered a1c to 4.6. Normal Cholesterol, great triglycerides, normal bp, normal EKG. Normal everything. I still had RA of course but even my CRP was much lower When I told my doc I hadnt taken my meds for two months his Mouth dropped open I even went for a bone scan and Found out my bone density improved greatly since Last check up. My acid reflux was gone too Eventually I got sick of fasting. Can’t explain it. Just stopped. Lost my mojo. Lost 60 pounds. I stayed keto for a long while. Then morphed to low carb. Then carb creep. Back to high carb. Here comes diabetes again once you are at that point. So ya. Back to keto/low carb. These days not doing huge fasting just some IF and skipping meals. As soon as you change your diet back to the way it was, all your problems rapidly return BTW still overweight but the 60lbs I lost during fasting is still off. Been this way 8 yrs.
6. u/Agreeable_Step_5317 [score=6, created=2025-11-11T19:45:31]: I've been following Dr. Fung's fasting recommendations for several years. I started off pretty zealous and lost 40 lbs while maintaining muscle mass. Since then I've slowly lost fat by just doing a short fast once a week or so. I've found i can maintain with fairly limited fasting, a decent diet, and exercise. I'm not off all the meds but I probably could be. Mounjaro is such a good drug and my insurance pays for it so why come off? Anyway, yes. You can keep the fat off once you stop seriously fasting but you do still have to keep most of the lifestyle changes. It's important to strength train and maintain/grow muscle mass. I also find it way harder to fast now. When I was obese it was relatively easy, now I get light headed. No idea why. Maybe it's just the excitement from seeing something actually work.
7. u/FustianRiddle [score=3, created=2025-11-11T20:25:11]: Depends on the person. My blood sugar goes up if I don't eat regularly.
8. u/cobaltstock [score=3, created=2025-11-11T23:13:37]: I lost 46kg with IF over several years and hope to lose another 14kg, perhaps over the next 3 years. It absolutely works.
9. u/fluidsdude [score=3, created=2025-11-12T05:02:27]: You mention nothing about stress mgmt, sleep, protein, fiber and exercise. Those are big levers too in t2 mgmt. What are you doing with these?
10. u/Lu-Tze [score=5, created=2025-11-11T17:38:32]: This is a bit complicated. Long term, no one knows because not enough people have done it long term. If you are able to lose weight, do intermittent fasting, add muscles and control your carb intake (or some combination of these), many people do show improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation. In some cases, you can reduce your medication or, less frequently, eliminate your medicines altogether. However, it is still just remission, i.e. you need to maintain that state actively. If you go back to your old life style or add back the weight, your insulin resistance will come back. On the flip side, most of these things have many benefits even outside of diabetes. And even if it is temporary, it will be beneficial. If you are going to do it, you have do it carefully because between not eating too many carbs in each meal and having a limited amount of time to eat, intermittent fasting almost always leads to significant caloric deficit. You have to up your protein intake and put in some weight training to ensure that the weight loss does not come from muscle loss. Ideally work with a dietician. There is a lot of woo on the internet so you could end up overdoing it and being miserable with minimal benefit.

12. u/sooohappy500 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T08:37:19]: I'm a huge fan of fasting--so many benefits beyond weight loss. I'd read Fung's book and was intrigued, but it wasn't until I learned of autophagy that I tried it. I started with IF, stretched to 24 hour, then 36 hour and now targeting 48 hour fasts once a week. Other benefits I hadn't anticipated: lower food bill, more time (not spent shopping, cooking, cleaning). I can't say I love fasting, but it's kinda like exercise--you get used to it and the benefits far outweigh the effort. Honestly, it was this podcast about Rapamycin (a cancer and anti-aging drug with many of same impacts as fasting) that made me curious and sent me down the rabbit hole to recognize the overall health benefits of fasting. [https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub](https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub) Heres the AI take on autophagy. (Note that I researched peer-reviewed credible sources on my trip down the rabbit hole, and I encourage anyone interested to do the same): Fasting triggers autophagy, a cellular "clean-up" process where the body removes and recycles damaged components. This cellular renewal is activated by nutrient and energy deprivation, which suppresses pathways like mTOR, allowing autophagy to begin. Short-term fasts (16-24 hours) and longer fasts (24-48 hours or more) can both induce autophagy, though prolonged periods may also engage different mechanisms. How fasting activates autophagy * **Nutrient deprivation:** When you fast, your cells experience a lack of nutrients and energy. * **Signaling pathways:** This lack of nutrients triggers a cellular response that activates enzymes like AMPK and inhibits the mTOR pathway, which are key regulators that "put the brakes" on autophagy. * **Initiating the process:** With the brakes off, autophagy can begin. This involves the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membraned structures that engulf and transport cellular waste to the lysosomes for breakdown and recycling. Effects and benefits of autophagy during fasting * **Cellular cleanup:** Autophagy removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, helping to maintain cellular health and function. * **Cellular efficiency:** It can lead to a more efficient cell by removing unnecessary components. * **Potential disease prevention:** Studies suggest a link between autophagy and the prevention of diseases associated with cellular waste, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. * **Fat burning:** Autophagy, specifically a process called lipophagy, can aid in burning fat by removing potentially toxic lipids. * **Energy production:** A byproduct of autophagy, alanine, can be sent to the liver to help create glucose through gluconeogenesis.
13. u/anneg1312 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T14:04:35]: It works. Short and long term. IN COMBINATION with a low carb and/or ketogenic diet. It worked for me and has done for many many people- long term. I think of it in 2 stages: 1. Correction 2. Maintenance. For correction consider going keto first, then adding IF after about a month. Reason is that bringing carbs down to that level (20-30g per day) helps your body metabolism to switch from burning primarily glucose for fuel to primarily burning fats for fuel. In addition to that wonderful shift, your hunger hormones start getting back in balance and no longer drive cravings and feelings of deep hunger. Fasting at that point becomes easy. Varying the length is super helpful too. Pick a minimum daily # of hours like 12, and then do some days 17, some 19 etc. Then add a couple longer ones a month…24, 36, 48. It will work. Takes between 6-12 months. Once you’ve got your a1c, lipid panel, other labs, and weight where you want them, start slowly and carefully adding some carbs back…try 40g for a week. Make sure you’ve not gained any weight back or seen more spikes. Then try 50g for a week.. check spikes, weight and notice if your cravings have shown back up etc… keep your fasting schedule to at least your minimum. Pay attention to how you’re feeling and spikes and weight. They will tell you if you’ve added too much back. Lots of people have done this for decades. Check out Beat Diabetes channel on yt. Lots of people talking about doing this long term.
