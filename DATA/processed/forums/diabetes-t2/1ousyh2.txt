===============================================================================

I was prescribed metformin, haven't started and will in a couple days when I get the script. My issue is sweets, mainly candy. I have a huge sweet tooth as I'm sure many of you do. What do you eat to help satisfy while adjusting? Edit* thank you all, some very good suggestions!

2. u/LarryMahnken [score=15, created=2025-11-11T19:32:28]: Remember, it's not just the sugar, it's the carbs. So sugar free cuts out part of the problem, but if it's a pastry or something you've still got the flour to deal with. Definitely focus on weening yourself off of sweets - cold turkey is a recipe for relapse. But I think you'll find that if you can gradually get sweets out of your diet, you'll both stop craving them as much and find you're enjoying other flavors much more than you are right now.

Steer clear of melons. Trail mix with a few m&amp;m’s, nuts, etc. Peanut butter is another go to for me. Almonds dusted in dark chocolate. Yogurts high in protein, like Greek or Icelandic, anything around 15g of carbs or under is good.
4. u/Affectionate-Cap-918 [score=6, created=2025-11-11T19:48:30]: I chewed sugar free gum more, made iced coffee drinks with sugar free syrups, made a mousse with sugar free pudding mixes and heavy cream, enjoyed low carb ice cream treats, ate blueberries with rediwhip, and started enjoying nuts and cheese (specialty expensive cheeses). Eventually I didn’t even miss the sweets (as much).
5. u/Smworld1 [score=6, created=2025-11-11T22:37:33]: A few tablespoons of peanut butter with some mini chocolate chips is a go to treat for me. I eat it with baby spoon.
6. u/Solid-Celebration442 [score=10, created=2025-11-11T19:31:48]: I have a lot of food noise for sweets and carbs. The only thing that has helped me is Mounjaro. It eliminates my food noise and cravings.
7. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=8, created=2025-11-11T19:19:41]: Sugar free candy, mainly the Russell stover kind
8. u/stuck_behind_a_truck [score=4, created=2025-11-11T20:32:07]: Phasing out sweet foods over time and not looking for substitutes worked better for me. Stopping sodas and not even drinking the Diets/Zeros, for example (GERD will cure you of a desire for acidic drinks, too). I feel like the slow fade rather than substitutions worked better because I slowly lowered my tolerance for sweet foods and now, and I’m serious, it takes several bites to finish a single Hershey’s Kiss because they are too sweet. If your numbers are high and you need to cut sugars ASAP look for Stevia sweetened substitutes. I’m ngl, Russell Stover does make an impressive mini peanut butter cup with Stevia. Plan on limiting stuff like this fairly quickly. Reducing your tolerance for sweet over time is really the best method for reducing temptation.
