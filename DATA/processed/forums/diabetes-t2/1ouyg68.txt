Hi, My 68 yrs old mum is new newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for about a month now and she hasn't been feeling well ever since she's started taking meds. She was still up and about cooking and cleaning pre-diagnosis, but since on meds, she's been uncomfortable and just stays in bed all day and stares into space or sleeps. Average Blood Pressure: 130-148 mmHg Average Blood sugar: 6.6-7.5 mmol/L She's lost about 4kg since then. Meds she's taking: - Metformin 500mg once daily - Amlodipine 5mg once daily - Bisoprolol 2.5mg once daily - 14 Amlodipine 10mg once daily (Not sure why twice) - 14 Aspirin 75mg once daily - 14 Simvastatin 20mg Her issues below: - Super Fatigued - Feels weak, even walking around is a challenge - Overall feeling exhausted all the time - Out of breath generally and when talking - Chest discomfort - Under arm pain in left side intermittently - Upper body feeling hot all the time, but also cold? - Lower legs from mid-shin down is cold - Always thirsty - Dizzy/ headaches - Fewer bowel movements 2-3 times a week only Her diet since diagnosed: Breakfast: - Small bowl of oats with egg mixed in Lunch &amp; Dinner - Brown basmati rice 50-100g dry weight - Streamed Fish, chicken or minced pork/ Egg - Blanche Lettuce or broccoli A slice of whole-wheat bread or cracker before meds in late afternoon Lots of water, and only water. She's very stubborn and picky with food only eats food that she's used to. Being based in the UK, seeing a doctor is near impossible, instead we see nurses unless it's life threatening. Waiting lists are up to 3 weeks to see a doctor. My question is, what is making her feel like this? Is it the meds, diet or something else, like menopause or a mental factor - depression? I'm so worried about her and hate seeing her waste away like this. She's a very strong person before and now can hardly move. I don't know what else to do. Thanks in advance!

Also, changing diet is a slow thing. If you try to do too much at once, it won’t be successful. She will need to permanently change her diet and lifestyle, adding in more movement to help regulate blood sugar. Many of the more dire outcomes of diabetes can be prevented by taking these changes seriously now, as damage occurs over the long term. Look into keto diet, although you do not want to completely eliminate carbs, just reduce them. It is kind of helpful in a way that she wants to eat the same things all the time. That makes counting carbs easier for most meals. However, the carb content of those meals may need to change from what she is eating now. Generally, half her plate should be non starchy vegetables, a quarter should be protein, and a quarter should be starch. You still have to watch servings sizes: maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown rice, or a half of a small sweet potato. If she will eat nuts, that is a good snack as long as she doesn’t eat too many. I would put all her meds in an online “drug interaction” site to see if any of these meds interact poorly with each other. I’d see if I could speak to a pharmacist/chemist too. Metformin is well known for causing gastric distress (diarrhea), especially at first, so it’s odd she has reduced bowel movements.

4. u/W_Roper [score=2, created=2025-11-12T10:37:12]: Look into food combinations and order of eating. I eat whole grain bread a bit, but never with out some protein along with it- peanut butter, avocado, an egg etc… Have a veggie starter like a salad. The fiber slows digestion, so if you eat carbs after your veggies and proteins it won’t spike your blood sugar as bad. The body will tolerate Metformin better after a month or so, so really try to stick that out instead of trying to jump to some new med. Exercise is vital. Just as important as diet and meds. Not that she needs to run marathons. But up and about cooking and cleaning is huge. Post meal walks really help.
5. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T21:13:41]: I know everybody’s gonna jump on the carb, brown basmati rice is actually got the lowest G.I./GL that’s not going to be a problem here. Many people advocating keto diet Ignore the genetic factor. High amount of saturated fat causes insulin resistance of the liver and of the muscle muscles. It may work for someone, but it may not work for others. The amount of medication‘s she is on has the side effect. I’m not saying she needs to get off of it but the Amlodipine and Bisoprolol both cause extreme fatigue, brain fog. And the statin she’s taking is causing the pain. Generally, whenever any statin is prescribed, the doctor usually puts them on CoQ10 because it depletes the CoQ10 in the body which causes muscle aches, etc.. Your question was about why she was laying in bed and feeling tired, this has nothing to do with her carb intake. Please do not stop what you’re doing because that is good. However, you might benefit from getting a second opinion from a different doctor. This does not look right, I would highly recommend going to a different doctor because it feels like over medication. I want you to do a Google search on those medication’s side effects. This way you can cross compare and address it with your doctor.
