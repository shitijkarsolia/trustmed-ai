Title: One of the common mistake after being diagnosed was undernourishment which does more harm than good. I fell into this trap and over exercised and undernourished my body. I became lethargic, shaky, brain fog, fatigue and weak. Anyone with same experience?

A big part of it for me is the psychological "victory" of taking a few bites and pushing away the rest - it was great at first but now I'm learning that I HAVE to eat more despite never feeling hungry.
2. u/Alyndia [score=8, created=2025-11-12T11:16:24]: Yes I totally freaked out and lost my appetite. I dropped 20 lbs in two months and wasn’t trying. My hair fell out from the stress. Do not recommend!
3. u/Pedal2Medal2 [score=6, created=2025-11-12T10:24:51]: Yes. I have severe gastro issues (thanks AI disease!) &amp; literally have no appetite unless I take a THC edible, which I can’t do til about 6 pm. Along with lots of exercise. So, my dietician &amp; I came up with a realistic plan, I graze, which I can handle, still keeping in mind total carbs etc., it’s been working well
4. u/ValkyrieSteed [score=6, created=2025-11-12T12:16:30]: YES OMG. I’m currently pulling myself out of it now. What helped was talking to my endo and asking her what limits I should have, and which ones I shouldn’t. I have OCD, which is the building block for eating disorders. Having someone to discuss my concerns with helped a lot. Obviously listen to your body. If some advice doesn’t work, don’t use it. But really see the extent of what you CAN eat and do. Best of luck to you!

6. u/ShaxxsSon [score=3, created=2025-11-12T16:13:45]: Not when I was first diagnosed, but I did go through this at some point. I swung too far in the other direction and restricted myself a lot trying to chase perfection. Any time I saw a reading above 180 I would internally panic and feel bad about myself, like I failed. I went from not caring about my readings to obsessing over them. It wasn't healthy. So I just ate less in an attempt to control my numbers. And while it did work, I always felt like crap physically and mentally because I wasn't eating enough. I wasn't giving my body what it needed. I'm doing better these days, l try to be more reasonable with my diet and allow some freedom for foods I like that aren't really diabetic friendly (like pizza and ice cream for example). It helps to keep my sanity, life's already stressful enough without dealing with this condition. My a1c is 6.1, yea it could be lower but honestly I'm ok with it.

8. u/LaToune65 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T13:28:41]: 3 weeks ago it was looking better and better. Than I went to an all inclusive resort. I did not drink but damn the buffet. I tried to walk as much as I could. My sugar levels were high. Now I have been back for a week and am trying to gain back control and it’s not working. Oh well! It’s a constant struggle.
9. u/Library_IT_guy [score=1, created=2025-11-14T12:05:14]: I have this issue right now on a semaglutide (Rybelsus). Been on it for over a year but still... I don't eat breakfast, extremely rare that I eat lunch. I'm simply not hungry and I'm overweight so... why fight it, right? I'm eating around 1,000 calories per day. It doesn't help that after I eat I often have to spend the next few hours running to the bathroom, so I REALLY don't want to eat during the work day. My GI system just goes nuts every few days, and my body just... sorry if this is gross, but it's like it is just trying to void everything in it all at once, and it does NOT stop until I take an Imodium. And at that point I'm so drained and tired I just chug water and lie down and pass out. Between not eating a lot and the other issues, my hormones are low and my vitamins are low. I'm on a prescription strength vitamin D. I've noticed that my body hair as a dude is going away. And... I'll spoiler this because it's a tiny bit NSFW, but... &gt;! certain um... urges, just aren't really there anymore. I want them to be there but.. they aren't. !&lt; I often find myself nodding off at my desk at work. Doesn't help that I also have central sleep apnea, which isn't quite the same as obstructive, meaning that CPAP treatment is only mildly beneficial. Helps but doesn't completely fix the issue. But hey, my A1C is below 6 and my blood pressure is somewhat reasonable, so... I guess I'm fine? /s
