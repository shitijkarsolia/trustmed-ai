I was told that it can be risky. How can someone have a safe pregnancy and deliver a healthy little one despite being T2 DM. Thank you.

My GP did an a1c test at my first appointment because I had GD in my first pregnancy, and it was 11. I was referred to my local diabetes in pregnancy clinic and started on insulin and metformin within two days. The first 8 weeks after diagnosis were really hard. My blood sugar was wildly out of control. I was trying to find the dose of insulin that worked. I was walking on the treadmill three times a day to minimize spikes. But I was in a good range after 8 weeks, and maintenance was easier than getting there. My a1c was 5.0 at 4 months in and I maintained that until the end of my pregnancy. I had 13 ultrasounds. They did an early anatomy scan to look for birth defects caused by high blood sugar, but that was clear. I had regular growth scans starting at 28 weeks, and I don't even know how many NSTs I had. My baby was perfectly fine though. My OB said she showed no signs of being affected by it at all. She was 6lbs9oz at birth, born at 37+4 weeks gestation, and she had no hypoglycemia, no jaundice, and I healed beautifully from my c section. I think the main thing was that the mental load was really high. Especially at the end of the pregnancy, I was dealing with lows, so calculating the right amounts of insulin to keep my after meal numbers in range and my fasting in range without sending me too low was a lot of work.

I saw my endo once a month, talked to my diabetes team (nurses and dieticians) every 2 weeks, and saw my OB every week by the end. In my third trimester, I did a no-stress test at the hospital every week and had ultrasounds for baby’a size every 2 weeks. I also had a couple extra ultrasounds for baby’s heart at a cardiologist since that is standard for diabetes women where I am. Managing my sugars was really really hard because I would spike unexpectedly, my sugars would peak like 3-4 hours after a meal instead of the expected 2 hours, and exercise was hard because I was sooo tired from the pregnancy. It’s all the placenta they throws things out of whack. I would eat the same thing every day for breakfast and some days I would go high, some days I would be perfectly in range…..it felt like such a crapshoot. That being said my A1c when I started pregnancy was 6.9, and it was down to 5.5 in my third trimester. I was induced ar 38 weeks (standard for diabetics) and my baby was 7.5 lbs. there is a big risk if your sugars are high, your baby will have low blood sugar, so baby’s blood sugar is tested 4 times in the first 24 hours of their life. Baby was perfect in my case. As hard as it all was, especially all the monitoring and appointments - I of course would say it was worth it. We are happy and healthy now and I am forgetting day by day how hard it was and am contemplating a second baby. You can likely find more on the sub bumperswhobolus but it does also include T1. Good luck!

I was taking med acting insulin at night and morning and then short acting before every meal. My insurance also covered Dexcom cgm so I was able to keep constant track of my blood sugars, only pricking to confirm highs or lows. It got harder at the end since I was injecting so much insulin and my body wasn’t absorbing them as well and leaving bumps right under my skin. I had appointments every week with mfm and had a few extra ultrasounds. I had a c-section at 37ish weeks because I had sudden high blood pressure even though it was low all through out pregnancy and a low lying placenta. But baby came out healthy!
4. u/hottub3359 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T12:55:52]: I’ve had 2 healthy babies while having T2. In addition to the normal OB visits, I met regularly with a MFM (maternal fetal medicine). Had to take my blood sugar 4x a day and sent them to the MFM weekly. They would help managing my meds. With my first child I was able to manage with just Metformin but had to use Insulin as well to handle my fasting for my second child. Extra ultrasounds and non-stress tests. It was stressful managing my blood sugar but worth it.
