This didn't happen overnight and one more week of doing as you've been doing isn't going to make or break anything. Have fun, enjoy your time together, and then you'll start doing your research and making changes.

Many of us indulged in poor eating habits, but there IS a genetic component, even for type 2. If it helps for the long term coping, many folks here who have been diabetic decades report aging with better health BECAUSE diabetes forces them to embrace good habits: eating well, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, managing stress. The people successful long term are people who take it seriously and do "all the things" to improve their health. It is definitely overwhelming initially. If you're not ready to tell family, don't. Enjoy your birthday and do some quiet things to minimize impact on your blood sugar. Like, if cooking at home or going out, maybe opt for a steak or chicken and have a big salad. Skip the potato and then have cake. And try to go for a walk afterward. Most of us indulge a bit for special events...it's more a matter of being good MOST OF THE TIME and not turning an "indulgence" into a bacchanalian extravaganza (like 3 helpings of mashed potatoes and stuffing and then multiple pieces of pie). You could maybe tell a half white lie for your birthday and say you have been feeling better eating keto, but you will splurge on a piece of cake. I only told two people about my initial diagnosis. Other family members had enough on their plates and I didn't want to worry them so I didn't tell others for 6 months. And by then I'd had two more doctor's visits, made major changes, and had my a1c down to 6 (lower now). You can do this. There will likely be a lot of food posts headed into Thanksgiving and that will give you a feel for how people balance things for special events. Take it a step at a time for now...take prescribed meds, add in exercise, reduce your carbs. If your doctor hasn't set you up with a nutritionist, ask for that appointment. EDIT: Just wanted to add this: I went through my pantry soon after diagnosis. Food banks are in desperate need right now so if you are motivated to get rid of unopened bags, boxes, and cans of things like rice, pasta and other carby things, you can remove the temptations from your home and help someone else at the same time.

I add in sugar free chocolate pudding , cocoa powder, peanut butter , dark chocolate chips on top. Serve in nut crust ( Walmart). Zero compromise. ( it DOES have calories even if glucose friendly - so still only special occasions ) Happy birthday !

But of course knowing that doesn’t make it any easier!, it just lets you know you’re not alone. It really does get better once you’ve had some time to process, climb the first part of the learning curve and settle on a plan that you feel good about moving forward with. That all takes a bit of time. Be kind and go easy on yourself as much as you can. Get some extra r&amp;r. This isn’t your fault. I’m sure you can think of 15 people your age who have similar lifestyles but don’t have diabetes. The genetic component is huge. The things that helped me most at the beginning: The book The Diabetes Code by Jason Fung helped me learn about how diabetes worsens and improves in the body. He also goes into low/lower carb eating and intermittent fasting (IF). Just know that super low carb eating and IF aren’t appropriate or right for everyone, though they do help many. There are lots of different eating plans. In time you’ll find something that works well for you. Also, I don’t involve myself in the controversy over terms like remission, good control, etc. The goal is improved health and wellbeing. Also, my sessions with my diabetes educators were invaluable. 1-hour sessions with someone who’s kind and knowledgeable to help me figure out my initial plan and to pepper with my 100s of questions. My insurance covered these 100%. This sub was really helpful too. Lots of good info, others’ personal and varied experiences, and lots of kindness and support. Hang in there, you’ll figure this thing out given a bit of time. ❤️🧸
5. u/FWIW47 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:08:05]: I was just diagnosed in August and already have mine under control (4.7 a1c!) so it can be done! The best first steps, in my opinion, is cutting out refined carbs (white bread, pasta, rice) and sugar immediately. Diet soda only, whole grain bread only, try to increase vegetables not fruit. Stay hydrated, add more protein to your meals and eat every 3 hours to keep blood sugar more stable. Also take a 10 minute walk after bigger meals as often as you can. If the weather sucks, do squats indoors. This will help bring down blood sugar after eating. Are you on any meds?

7. u/david_fireman33 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T10:47:58]: have you begun to have any diabetic related complications like neuropathy? If not then just start tight control of your BS asap and you will be fine
8. u/ElectronicHold7325 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T04:47:25]: I must recommend Jason Fung as well. His books and his YouTube-channel were a huge help for me 3 months ago! I managed to lower my hba1c from 12.1 % to 6.2% with metdoemin and his strategies.
