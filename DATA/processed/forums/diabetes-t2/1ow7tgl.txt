===============================================================================

I am trying to figure out (over analysis) the relevant nutrient levels of the various foods I eat. Specific use case at this time would be "grains", but later also would be other starches like potatoes, etc.. I am currently of the belief that I need (want?) to know "Total carbs", "fiber", "sugar alcohols", "sugars", "glycemic index", etc.. I am understanding that I can calculate "net carbs", which from what I can tell thus far is the most significant parameter. This started with my having stumbled across (online) recommendations to eat hulled barley rather than rice\*\*\*. This source made a clear distinction between "pearled barley" and "hulled barley". This source made it appear the difference to be vast (between barley and rice as well as pearled and hulled barley). So I started substituting hulled barley for white rice. My wife asked my why I was doing that. So we went online (our phones at the dinner table) and started looking at numbers. Our initial hits indicated hulled barley to be WAY higher than white rice in carbohydrates, which puzzled me and caused me to dig slightly deeper at the time to find that, apparently, the numbers were for RAW rice and barley. And on and on and on it went to the point of me deciding I needed to create a spreadsheet to keep track and then be able to easily reference. \*\*\*(OK, it was "FED" to me by the "barley industry", no doubt) FAIL FAIL FAIL Problem is that I can't find any SINGLE source for all of this information and when I start looking at a variety of sources offering only a portion of the relevant parameters I find that those parameters contained in both sources are significantly different. Therefore I don't know which of them to accept. Further compounding it is that some sources show the values for "raw", while not making it apparent, and other sources are showing for "cooked", while not making it apparent. There is a large difference between "raw" and "cooked" when it comes to grains. Who eats raw rice, anyway? Have any of you out there found a single source that lists all these parameters and has them in "raw" for AND "cooked"? For grains, "cooked" is probably the only relevant form I would be eating. But other foods, like vegetables it would make total sense to eat raw and cooked so the values for raw and cooked would be relevant. UPDATE: I found a site that at least has some potential, others might be interested. [https://glycemicindex.com/](https://glycemicindex.com/) This is a site run by the University of Sydney. They have a database that has what looks to be a comprehensive listing of various food-stuffs with their Glycemic Index and Glycemic Loads. I've noticed a problem with it, though, which I'm trying to work through now. I'm thinking that if I can get "Glycemic Load" for ingredients and don't need to stress over the actual carbs and sugars and fibers. My understanding is that "Glycemic Load" takes all of that into account and comes up with a number representing the overall impact on the amount of carbohydrates your body has to battle and how quickly. A low GL (Glycemic Load" indicates the foodstuff is one or the other or a combination of low carbs, low sugar, high fiber, etc.,. The higher the fiber is the lower/slower the sugars are released (something along those lines) or simply lower carbs means lower sugars to be dealt with, etc..

2. u/Thesorus [score=1, created=2025-11-13T11:09:01]: In general, start with raw ingredients (grains, meat, vegetables ... ) for example 50g of raw rice + 100g of raw steak + 10g of butter ... Use google to get the nutritional information for ingredients. I don'T think there's an authoritative list somewhere (at least a free one). also, hulled barley should probably marginally better than rice because of the hull and the extra fibre.
