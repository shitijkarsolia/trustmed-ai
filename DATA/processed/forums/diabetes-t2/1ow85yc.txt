===============================================================================

OK, I’ve had Type 2 for over 20 years, and honestly, it still scares the life out of me sometimes. High BG, low BG—it’s like trying to drive a semi-truck with no steering. And this forum, as helpful as it is, sometimes makes me even more anxious and second-guess myself and my readings all day long. So, for everyone else out there who’s losing their mind or scared half to death (like me), let’s not forget there’s still that 1% bright side to having diabetes. (P.S. If I’m wrong—just let me have this one.) **The top perks:** 1. When BG dips below 60… it’s ***Captain Crunch time!*** **Guilt-free!** 2. Now I have a totally valid excuse for a bad mood. 3. Steak is *not* a luxury—protein as far as the eye can see. 4. The perfect reason to skip social drinking (never liked it anyway). 5. And best of all, the ultimate excuse to dodge foods you hate: “Oh no, I can’t eat eggplant anymore… doctor’s orders. 😉”

7. u/SuzIsCool [score=2, created=2025-11-13T12:03:53]: More has been learned about fat. Dr. Jason Fung, a leading professional in diabetes agrees that good fat, real animal fat, is permitted and encouraged. [Fat Fiction](https://youtu.be/j3fYf38AU6w?si=P7B_isuhPEun0yfn)
