Title: The body is not a machine to be forced. It is a living system that adapts, learns, and remembers.

Hi, Just want to share some personal experiences in this T2 diabetes journey. I am 58 yrs old male. Got diagnosed T2 with HBA1C 7.4% 2 years ago. Through controlled diets, exercises (walk, yoga, mediation), rest and self stress management and without any medication from beginning until now, my A1C gradually dropped to 6.8% then 6.1% then 5.4% and currently 5.2% and stays steady for the past 10 months. But, it's not about the numbers, it's about the whole system reaching the level of healing, adapting and self regulating. One of the keys I have found throughout my journey is that **our body has wonderful capabilities to recover and to heal if we give it time and right conditions**. We might have unknowingly overworked or even abused our body over a long period and then we forcefully and frantically try to reverse the course in such stressful way. I’ve learnt that we need to listen to our body’s response little by little and patiently help it correcting and healing. It needs time to learn and to create new and good memories. I know that medication might be helpful to stop the damages but medication is unlikely to heal or to help our body to recover, specifically with T2 and especially if we maintain the habit of destroying our body. The process of healing and recovering require the complete reprogramming of our internal system to find harmony, balance and rhythm again, which might take a long time. The more rush, the more stress, the more harm done as the body is not a computer you can reset instantly. It is a *biological memory system* that needs time. To heal and to recover, we need: * rhythm * rest * movement * nourishment * sunlight * calmness * consistency And avoid: * panic * over-diet * over-fasted * over-exercised * over-restricted * punished ourselves * got frustrated * tried to “fix everything in 3 weeks” And memory takes time: * to rewrite * to stabilise * to trust new patterns * to unlearn old stress responses The body heals in ***slow waves***, **not violent jumps**. I know we have different life styles, circumstances, environments but we all are having the same things: we have time to eat, to rest, to walk, to exercise, even very little. In our modern life these days, our lives are too fast, we are too stressed, we are eating too much ultra processed foods, we are moving our bodies too little, we are staying inside too much, we are sitting down too long. Fortunately, **we can all change these little by little**. **Recovery should be sustainable and enjoyable**. It should not be a burden or something we are so stressed over (such as we still want to eat that much cake, drink that much soda etc). If we relying on medication so that we can still harm our body then it will reach the inevitable consequence sooner. Instead, we can save medication for the later years when our body is old and run down, our muscles are no longer enough to absorb glucose, our pancreas is blunt and our insulin is so bad. In the meantime, we can always help our system to reprogram and to heal. Cheers,

Over many years, I’ve successfully lost 100 lbs and am firmly in a healthy body weight, I eat balanced but lower carb foods, and as much as I continue to hate it, I exercise. I still require medication to manage my blood sugar. Guess my body didn’t get the memo. Cheers.

To put down those of us who choose to or are advised by our doctors to use medication, GLP1s or whatever else it may be, by saying that we should not do that and save it for later, is potentially harmful commentary for people that are just trying to better themselves. This should be a community of support, not shame.

You’re trying to make it sound like what you did will work for everyone and it’s simply not true. You’re even trying to sound like you understand what’s going on in the body medically, yet I doubt that you even have a grasp of what’s happening at the cellular level. Native Americans, for example, have genetic predispositions for low beta cell function, no matter how well they “rest and recover”. Understanding the epidemiology of a cellular-level predisposition to insulin resistance is much more than just saying “you’re not calm enough and you need more sunlight”. To equate “relying on medication” with harming your body is absolutely sending the wrong message to people. My endocrinologist informed me that for many people with diabetes, medication is a critical and non-negotiable part of their treatment plan, regardless of how meticulously they manage their diet and exercise. A healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise) is an important foundation of treatment, but it is often insufficient over time due to the progressive nature of the disease. Medication can become necessary to maintain safe blood sugar levels, prevent long-term complications affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, and supplement the body's diminishing ability to produce or use insulin effectively, regardless of how stressed we are. You talk about only needing it when your body is “old and run down”, but your experience at your age isn’t going to be everyone else’s.
