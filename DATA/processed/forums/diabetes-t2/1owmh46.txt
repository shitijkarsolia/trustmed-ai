===============================================================================

[31f, 209 lbs] On Oct 23rd i got some test results back and found out I have t2 diabetes. My A1C was 11.2 and blood sugar 445. I immediately went on metformin 2x a day and glipizide 1 a day. Also immediately changed my diet. No carbs or sugar. I had a meeting with a diabetic educator a few days ago and she was very happy with my progress. My average numbers the past week have been between 105-125. When I get below 90 I experience symptoms of "lows" (shaking, vision blur, dizzy, sweating). I eat candy or something and feel ok shortly after. Doc said it was normal for me right now. She told me to stop taking the glipizide and so now im only doing metformin 1000 mg total a day. She said eventually I can decide if I want to stay on that or change to mounjaro, that it is up to me. I have no idea?? Food is stressing me out so much. Im eating great. But the constant food noise in my mind is burning me out already. Im vegetarian and recycling the same handful of meals throughout the week.. they are delicious but I still crave things I can't have. Desperately. Finger pricking is also getting so old lol. She gave me a free 10 day dexcom g7, and it has been informative to see how levels rise and fall. But the device has been wrong by about 20 points each time I double check with a finger prick test... Anyways. Sorry for rambling, ultimately im curious if you prefer metformin or Mounjaro? Or have any advice for me on deciding? Thank you in advance &lt;3

2. u/squirrelinhumansuit [score=5, created=2025-11-13T21:14:26]: Glp-1s help with the thoughts and cravings for food. It sounds like you're doing all the right things!
3. u/psoriasaurus_rex [score=4, created=2025-11-13T23:11:56]: I actually take both but if I could only keep one it would be the Mounjaro. It’s not even a question. I have been taking it for two years now and have been free of “food noise” for two years. It’s life changing. My a1c is also nice and low (5.1 last check), and while I’m careful with my diet, I don’t have to do anything extreme. ETA: I’m not a vegetarian, but my diet is mostly plant based. I eat very little meat. I haven’t had any trouble eating that way as a diabetic with Mounjaro.
4. u/kippy_mcgee [score=3, created=2025-11-14T02:44:11]: I’m on metformin, my mmg was only measured to be 6.3 but i’m jumping on mounjaro as soon as i can afford it. it not only helps with the noise but also inflammation which i’m all for. how my doctor explained it was that metformin is protective and quite mild while GLP1 is a lot more actionary
5. u/Laczer [score=2, created=2025-11-14T03:06:29]: Your diagnosis, medication, and lows experiences all are nearly a mirror to mine. In April I was 11.8, put on Met and Glip, at a 2 month checkup my numbers were like yours but I wanted better "scores" and to be a little looser with my diet. I was told to drop the glipizide and we ADDED a low dose of Mounjaro, keeping metformin. In October I had a 5.7 a1c and feel like my diet is a sustainable balance of daily low-carb eating "like a t2 diabetic should" and occasional "I really want an éclair from the bakery, so I'm going to eat that éclair at the bakery" 😅
6. u/buttershdude [score=2, created=2025-11-14T03:46:19]: RE wrong by 20 points - the meter's allowed margin of error is 15-20% and CGMs are worse than that. Plus, the CGM is delayed by as much as 20 mins vs the finger prick. So being within 20 points of each other is actually pretty good.
7. u/deacc [score=2, created=2025-11-14T04:44:39]: I have never been on Mounjaro and don't want to be. I am currently on Lantus and Metformin with the hope that evenetually I will only need Metformin. I cold turkey on carbs heavy food that I use to have. Like rice, regular pasta, noodles etc. Really haven't had any craving issues. I replace noodles with zucchini noodles and daikon noodles. For pasta, I have found that the black bean pasta and endamame pasta made by The Only Bean company does not spike me. Since you're a vegetarian, do you have an Asian grocery store close by? I am asking because they have so much more varieties of leafy greens so you're have plenty of options. (And IMO, the Asian veggies are so much more flavorful anyway.) Additionally, I don't want to be on Mounjaro because I don't want to lose weight. If I lose even 10lbs, I will be underweight according to BMI calculation. I know not everyone lose weight on GLP-1 but since my current medication, lifestyle and diet is keeping my numbers at a good level, I am not going to mess with what is working. I also do finger pricking, it is just part of my routine now that I am used to. So it doesn't bother me that much. I know I am not getting a full picture without a CGM but I also don't want to deal with false sensor reading and calibration time every time you change the sensor.
8. u/cintu13 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T05:06:18]: I would give Mounjaro a try if you are able. For me it has been a miracle drug. (33F) I was diagnosed back in June with very similar numbers, 11.4 A1C and 340 fasted glucose. All of my diabetes symptoms went away within days of my first 2.5mg shot and my sugar went down to 150 average. I’ve been on 5mg since August and my sugar is down to normal levels. I’m able to eat all the foods I like without having a spike. I also use a Dexcom and it has been great to see how I react to foods. My biggest recommendation, wear it on your stomach, I don’t deal with sensor issues or lows. The arm wasn’t great, I kept bumping it against stuff and would get fake lows during my sleep. Everyone reacts different so your experience might be different but it has been so great not to have to take pill every day. Happy to answer any questions!
9. u/3boyz2men [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:27:18]: I'm on both. My Endo said that they work together
10. u/GolfballDM [score=2, created=2025-11-14T20:26:36]: Both my wife and I have noticed that food noise goes waaaaay down for both of us on Mounjaro.
