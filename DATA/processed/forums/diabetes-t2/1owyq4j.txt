===============================================================================

This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. On December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, "What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?" I responded, "Treat my what now?" And he said, "Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician." So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. My primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. I did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. For my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. After 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. When I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate "when I felt hungry" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. In June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. In July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. This has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. I hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades.

It’s such a tangible record of how this all works, and how real people manage diagnoses. I’m perfectly parallel to you: in the ER last New Year’s Eve, but for me it was my gallbladder. Nurse asked “how are you managing your diabetes?” And I said, thinking she was reading someone else’s chart, “I don’t have diabetes.” But I’ve since lost 50 lbs and have been in remission since June. Best of luck to you in the months and years to come, keep it up, and thanks for sharing!

I'd just gotten pregnant and my doctor did an a1c since I'd had GD in my first pregnancy, and it was 11. I managed to keep weight gain minimal during my pregnancy, and now I'm 50lbs below my pre baby weight at 4 months postpartum. I'm really hoping to be under 200 in the next six months, but I'm at 235 now and haven't been under 230 since I was 15.

Huge congrats on hitting 100 lbs down! that’s seriously no small thing 👏 I also have type 2 diabetes, and while I haven’t had major weight loss like you, I’ve been using GLP-2 from Rejuvatide Peptides under my doctor’s care; it’s helped me keep my blood sugar stable and stay within a healthy range, even when my weight doesn’t move much (I lost close to 35 pounds but that was it). Your consistency with diet and workouts is really inspiring, seriously great work! 🙌
