===============================================================================

My Dad was recently diagnosed, he doesn’t need insulin and has started taking medication similar to ozempic. I know most diabetes stems from poor habits but there’s certain things I don’t see him giving up so I wanted to get the consensus from the source. He does drink the ultra zero sugar monsters about 1-3 a day and I am concerned on what they can do considering there are still artificial sweeteners in them. Also we both love Italian ice the cups that we get usually are about 20 grams of sugar and he only eats 1 I’m wondering if it is still acceptable to maintain that or should we find a better alternative. Besides that are there any recommendations you can make on how to create a better diet built around his condition? Should he look into a glucose monitor? Any advice helps! Thank you all and god bless.

It doesn’t seem like it would be hard to make, but maybe alternative sweeteners affect the ability to freeze correctly. As far as dietary advice, there is no shortage of information sources for people with diabetes. I recommend you start with a referral from your dad’s doctor to a diabetes educator/dietician to get information tailored to your dad’s specific dietary needs. You can also try the American Diabetic Association website: [https://diabetes.org/food-nutrition/understanding-carbs/carb-counting-and-diabetes](https://diabetes.org/food-nutrition/understanding-carbs/carb-counting-and-diabetes)

There are a lot of things that might make those habits fine for 9 in 10 people but push another person over the edge. Generally the information you find about people testing foods is done with a 50 gram dose of carbohydrates. I would suggest trying to stay much lower until you get a monitor. The long term goal is to keep blood sugar below 130 almost all the time. It will be normal to spend a lot of time above that at first. My biggest success was finding a way to make pasta dishes without raising my blood sugar levels above 120. There are tricks.
