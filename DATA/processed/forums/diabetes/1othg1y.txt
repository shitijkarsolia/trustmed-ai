Make sure you keep your feet clean, use lotion on them (good time to massage your feet), wear clean socks and shoes that are not too tight.

It may be an early sign of circulation issues or nerve damage. High glucose levels over time can weaken blood vessels and nerves, making capillaries more fragile, so even minor bumps can cause bruising. Healing may also be slower, and the risk of infection higher. My endocrinologist told me that foot injuries in those with diabetes deserve extra attention, big time when one's glucose isn't well controlled. I was told to look out for the following regardless of where the bruise is located... \+Bruising that doesn't fade or gets darker over time \+Swelling, warmth, or redness around the area \+Increasing pain or numbness \+Skin changes (skiny, thin, or dry) \+Any wound, blister, or break in the skin that develops. If any of these show up, it is worth getting checked out, big time, due to your A1C. Feet are particularly vulnerable in those who are diabetic, so it is better to be cautious early than reactive later.

Poor circulation can lead to serious issues. You probably just have a bruise, but for the cost of a co-pay. You can have your anxiety alleviated and a pair of trained eyes ready if there is a problem.
