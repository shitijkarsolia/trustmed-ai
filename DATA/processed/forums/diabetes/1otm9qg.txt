===============================================================================

Been noticing the past several months that spicy chicken patties that that once seemed alright at first, now give me a blood sugar spike that seems consistent but variable in the timing and amount. I'm going to stop buying them from here on, but between those and a spicy chili I tried that also gave me a spike, that likely means that I'll have to stop having all spicy foods. Anyone else have experience with similar spikes, or have you figured out a insulin dose to work around it?

Even non-betics have spikes sometimes. Since you've said you're type 1, you should be able to cover what you eat in moderation with appropriate insulin doses.
