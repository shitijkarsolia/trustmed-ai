===============================================================================

New Type 2 diabetic, A1C 11.7, was 6.5 6 months ago. Dr prescribed today: 500mg Metformin for one week, and then 1000mg after the first week, Crestor for cholesterol, and then 2.5mg of Mounjaro weekly, with her saying that they want to gradually increase the dose every 4 weeks Before the test 6 months ago, my A1C and blood sugar has always been normal. I am worried about taking so many medicines, especially all at once, in my head it seems extreme. I have done no favors to my health with how I've eaten this year, but I have started losing weight, even exercised yesterday and had a fasting BG of 122, high end of prediabetic, or maybe low end of diabetic, but first time all year I try to take action and take health seriously, I had an immediate response. I want to start just with the Metformin and Crestor since my cholesterol is bad, and see how things go in 3 months, but Dr isn't having any of it, and seemed to rush me off the phone which was a bit disheartening as I couldn't ask all my questions. I'm really scared, and worried about so much medicine at one time and side effects, complications, etc. I know I have to make wholesale changes and maintain them, which I am ready to do, and can do. I plan to do everything I can to put this thing into remission. I am just wondering those that have been on it, what has your experience been like? Was it couple with metformin and other stuff? I know everyone is different and reacts different, just wondering what others have experienced or encountered, if theres any risks, has it helped, etc

Since your doctor is dismissing your questions, I would recommend finding a new doctor and re-run the labs since you have questions. I would also be requesting to slowly increase the dosage rather than rush through every 4 weeks. Diabetics can sometimes respond better to certain doses, such as having better blood sugar numbers on 2.5 that 5. Plus there's a maximum dose that you want to save as long as possible. I was diagnosed last August at 11.4. I made major lifestyle changes to my diet and exercise in addition to the Mounjaro, and a year late, I'm 80 pounds lighter and at 4.9. My cholesterol is now normal too. But that being said, my doctor didn't move up to the next dose every 4 weeks and instead let my body dictate that. Obviously the results have been positive. My experience is that I lost more weight before Mounjaro just waiting for it be approved than I did in the first 6 weeks on Mounjaro. It was working on my blood sugar and inflammation, and weight loss wasn't seen for a hot second despite being things "right." Honestly, the risk of a high A1C trumps any risks with a GLP-1 unless you're allergic. Every time I was frustrated, I remembered that my goal is to control the disease, not lose weight. That perspective has helped me keep things going when I wanted to quit.

For me, Mounjaro has been **incredible** with blood sugar control. If you're going to do that, you might want to wait on the metformin just to see how you respond. Metformin can also have GI side effects, and for some people so does Mounjaro, so you may want to see how you react to one of them first before subjecting yourself to both at the same time.
3. u/vodka_philosophy [score=1, created=2025-11-10T19:13:08]: I was diagnosed T2 in Feb of this year with a1c 11.8. I was already on metformin for pcos and refused statins (I know it's a divisive issue but that was my choice and my doctor was okay with it) and he added Mounjaro. It has been, I'm not even kidding, amazing for me. I had follow up labs last week and my a1c was down to 5.4, my liver values (which had been significantly elevated indicating NAFLD for several years) are completely normal. My total cholesterol was still high but much lower than previously as was my LDL but my HDL was much improved and normal and my triglycerides (which had been really high for over a decade) were also normal. Idk how much of that was "just" the Mounjaro vs how much was me cutting out sugar almost entirely (which I would not have been able to do without the Mounjaro - I've tried before and failed multiple times), but I feel so much better now than I did - I didn't realize how bad I felt or for how long until I actually felt better. I'm healthier now than I have been in a long time even before I was diabetic (which, my a1c was normal every year until this one, so it's not that I was diabetic for years without knowing... I just was unhealthy in multiple other ways. The one negative I've experienced is that I lost weight quickly enough (once I hit 12.5mg that is... very slow before that) that my thyroid levels got out of whack. I don't have a thyroid anymore so I take levothyroxine and, in the 6 months between lab draws, I had moved into the hyperthyroid range pretty significantly, so now we're playing the adjust-the-dose-and-recheck game until I'm back at normal. All that said, there are quite a few people for whom Mounjaro hasn't been all it was hyped up to be, so take what I said with a grain of salt and know everyone is different. Some people have bad side effects, some of those have had the side effects go away while some haven't. It just really varies from person to person and dose to dose. I do suggest talking with your doctor about starting the metformin first and getting used to it because it can cause stomach issues at the start, so starting it and Mounjaro at the same time may increase stomach upset. Alternately, they may prefer doing it in the reverse order or want you to try both at the same time. I am most definitely not a doctor, so talk to yours before deciding anything, and find a new one if yours won't listen to your concerns or work with you on timing new meds.

I've already done lots of damage to my body and I don't want to do any more damage. that said, if you feel like your doctor is dismissive of your concerns, it would be good to perhaps change to one who will hear out your concerns and work with you to address them.
