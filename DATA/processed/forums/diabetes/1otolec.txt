My post meal sugars haven't been recorded as high as I'm expecting for this session of freestyle Libra. I had some cereal a couple of hours ago and it's at 120's which is a between meal blood sugar for me. Yesterday I had little chocolate and usually my blood sugar would go at least to 170's but this time it only seemed to go maybe to 160's. I haven't been eating poorly and my other measurements seem normal. Should I assume that things are going fine and that I just have it under control, or should I be concerned that this sensor isn't functioning properly?

I just got a new one from them when my old one was FIFTY points low. It happens. Get a blood meter. Take care of yourself. You've got this.
