===============================================================================

So I've been tracking what my blood sugar does after I eat breakfast. Of my few go-to choices, the one that seems to be the best as far as not spiking too high is -- get this -- toast with cashew butter. I would think eggs and strawberries would spike lower than toast. Toast contains bread, for God's sake. Anyway, diabetes is weird.

My blood sugar jumped from 99 to 203 in 1 hour. However, 2 days prior, I had a slice of pumpkin pie with real whipped cream (It's my favorite and I absolutely could NOT pass it up!), and my blood sugar went from 91 to 117 in an hour. (Both times it returned to baseline by hour 2.) Nothing makes sense. I'm as confused as you are. 🤷

5. u/deacc [score=3, created=2025-11-10T15:41:40]: My go to breakfast is eggwhites scrambled and broccoli. I can't do fruit for breakfast. It spike me more than I like. No issue having them for lunch and dinner though.
6. u/rainy71717 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T20:06:14]: Did you test it several times over several days? Other things, like how much exercise you got the day before, how well you slept, if your getting sick or fighting off an illness that you don’t have symptoms for, can all influence your BG. But yeah, sometimes it’s just inexplicable. You e made me curious - now I need to buy some strawberries so I can do a few tests lol.

You can even have bacon and/or avocado with it, if you like. And if find the right bread, and there are a few brands that work, you can have avocado toast with an egg on top, too. Eggs are almost always safe for most people. Yogurt and berries (but just a few) won't spike me, but I think some people have issues with yogurt.
