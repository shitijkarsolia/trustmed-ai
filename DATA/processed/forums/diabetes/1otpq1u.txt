So, BCBS. I have a 750, 1250, and 2000 deductible plan. The 2000 also allows me to put in, and get employer added HSA funds. But, (should I post the plan details?) with things like pumps/DME, and then all the doctor visits, and say, add therapy in there.....it seems that the higher plan is actually hella cheaper

So for the $750 deductible plan, add up the cost of premiums, any co-pays or visit fees you'll probably use, DME costs, prescription costs, etc. Repeat for the other plans. One of my previous employer plans they gave a decent HSA contribution so that the deductibles weren't actually much different, and then I could put HSA money aside for my remaining costs (plus the premium was cheaper).

One of my plans was an HSA high deductible and it ended up being cheaper because I was going to hit my out of pocket max half way through the year then the plan covered. The other plan was copays that were ok but a bit higher premium and lower deductible. The copays did not go towards my out of pocket max. I would have spent around 9k on my health care a year vs 4k. Sadly it's never apples to apples.
4. u/Schmoopybear1 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T22:55:15]: Pay attention to total out of pocket max per year. For me it made more sense to go high deductible as I'd hit the max with either plan and high deductible gets me an HSA. Just shifts my annual costs to earlier in the year due to the deductible.
