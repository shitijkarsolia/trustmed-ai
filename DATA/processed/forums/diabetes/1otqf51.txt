===============================================================================

I ate a cauliflower pizza last night. Before I ate it my sugar was 89 mg/dL. Afterwards 1-2 hour later it was 110. I don’t really feel that was that bad, but I’m not sure. So, people of Reddit, what do you consider a large glucose spike? Anything over 20? 40?

It’s fine is your glucose “spikes” you just don’t want it to go super high and you want it to come down asap. I hope it was yummy! Did you make it yourself? Edit: the last time I tried cauliflower pizza I was over 250 for 6 hrs lmao

3. u/hanbohobbit [score=17, created=2025-11-10T14:56:43]: I don't personally sweat spikes too badly unless they linger and/or are stubborn to fix. As long as my overall TIR is good, I try not to stress. I got enough to stress about otherwise, haha.
4. u/migas1 [score=25, created=2025-11-10T14:25:43]: Thats not a spike. It is a t1d wish. 😁
5. u/Dragon3766 [score=11, created=2025-11-10T14:40:28]: 110 is great mine is sometimes over 200 after I eat so you're doing great 👍
6. u/SolidLava99 [score=7, created=2025-11-10T16:35:32]: Personally gave up trying to “control” spikes, mine can go really high up to 300 sometimes due to cheat meal and sometimes randomly especially “dawn”, I look at my overall daily average as long as my levels are “in range” for 60% or more of the time I’m happy, working to improve them. I use a CGM, Used to be way worse
7. u/ttkciar [score=6, created=2025-11-10T14:41:24]: To me a spike is a 50 mg/dL or greater rise, which usually means something I wasn't expecting to have sugar in it actually had a lot of sugar in it. Like someone else said, if a rise isn't enough to take you out-of-range, don't sweat it too hard, but do figure out exactly what caused it so you can avoid it in the future. The next time it probably will take you out-of-range. **Edited to add:** As a general rule I care less about spikes than I do about going out-of-range, but I also keep a pretty narrow range for myself (80 to 130 mg/dL), so any spike is pretty much guaranteed to take me out-of-range unless I was starting out-of-range-low (under 80). If a modest rise of 20 takes me to 140, I take care of it pretty urgently.
8. u/jadedjen110 [score=6, created=2025-11-10T14:49:21]: 110 isn't a bad spike at all. Normal blood sugar is 80-120 so you're in range.
9. u/Early_Marsupial1673 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T14:33:16]: It’s so maddening, I had cauliflower crust on Saturday, plus 30. Had it cold the next morning, plus 80. So much for resistant starch, at least for me.
10. u/noodle-face [score=3, created=2025-11-10T18:53:38]: 20 is what a normal person would see. You're fine A spike to me is like 100+
11. u/SpyderMonkey_ [score=2, created=2025-11-10T16:19:05]: FYi, most cauliflower pizza has a large portion of rice flour in it. They are meant to be gluten free, not low carb. Those numbers are good! Most cauliflower pizza bumps me by 80-140 points depending on the circumstance. I had one once that was worse than regular pizza and spiked me over 300. Pretty sure it was all rice flour...
12. u/psoriasaurus_rex [score=2, created=2025-11-10T19:45:58]: I try to keep my glucose under 150, and my fasting under 100. As long as that’s true 99% of the time, I don’t worry about spikes.
13. u/Elsbethe [score=2, created=2025-11-11T08:45:32]: You do know that people without diabetes have what you're calling a spike when they eat. That's called normal
14. u/Ok_Requirement_1302 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T09:45:20]: I love and really miss pizza. I love deep dish. And I have a husband and 2 teenage boys so eliminating is out of the question. I've experimented with thin crust pizza stuffed with cheese, Friday I had one slice (it was a large one so maybe the size of 2 regular with cut cucumbers and carrots and 2 large glasses of water. I went up to 10 (we measure between 4-10) but didn't go over. I'm happy with that result. I've tried cauliflower crust and I'd rather just not eat pizza.
15. u/iaumpqc [score=2, created=2025-11-12T12:59:44]: A difference in a reading, 10-20% is not a spike.
16. u/Bitter-Contract9546 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T18:52:02]: That's not even near bad. You're totally good at 110!
17. u/Foreign_Plate_4372 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T16:50:08]: Your hba1c should be below 7 (124) measured over a 90 day period, that works out to 8.5 (153) on a glucose monitor If your blood glucose samples are usually within the 5s and 6s (less than 126) then the odd spike won't kill you, the damage from diabetes comes from high blood sugar levels over long periods causing sticky blood which damages small blood vessels.
18. u/Sprig3 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T19:39:00]: Spike is a really strange term. It seems it originated talking about non diabetics or only slightly diabetics. To look like a spike, it needs to go up fast AND down fast. As such, I think anything 40/hour up and down is a spike. In common usage, though, it seems to just be up. Spike up and flatten out is a spike now. Doesn't look like a spike on a cgm screen. Looks like a mesa. But, for that, I'd say a spike needs to be larger.
19. u/staryoshi06 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T15:39:33]: i would say above 11 mmol/L or above 10 for a significant amount of time
