I understand that this is just something we may have to deal with but the cgm adhesive looks pretty gross after a few days of life. Any way to remedy this? Which covers are good? I use the Libre 3 plus.

I can't vouch for other brands since this is my first month with a CGM, but I've been using Skin Grip brand over patches. They definitely get a bit frayed by the end of the 10 days, but hold up quite well otherwise.
2. u/femme-cassidy [score=3, created=2025-11-10T19:37:37]: Black skin grip over patches. When my dexcom starts looking a little worse for wear (usually around 5 days in) I put the overpatch on over it. I know they make patches for Libre 3 also. Maybe they're a good option for you.

The Air or Clear ones from 'not just a patch' fit the Libre 3 nicely. They’ve got a non-stick middle so you can change the patch without pulling up the sensor.

I think my last one was still perfect when it took it off. I had some others I bought off Amazon that only made it like a week before needing replacing. They did, however, come with a little hard cover for the sensor that made it easy to peel the patch off and replace.
