===============================================================================

On July 23 I went to the doctor because of diabetes symptoms. Blood sugar was over 500 and a1c was 10.4 I was prescribed Metformin (1 pill daily) and a Mounjaro injection once per week. I started the Carnivore diet that day and I’ve strictly adhered to it 99% of the time. No carbs, no bread, no starchy foods, no sugar, etc. Just meat, eggs and cheese. Today was my appointment for follow-up bloodwork. My a1c is now 5.3 Fortunately I’ve never had any health issues, just 1 kidney stone and that was 6 years ago. I just turned 57 and I guess it’s time for some lifestyle changes. I’ve lost 35 pounds and I feel great. So if you’ve been diagnosed there’s hope. If I can do it anyone can.

And when you run into management issues stemming from insurance coverage of meds, supplies and such, make sure to reach out to your Endo, they tend to be rockstars when fighting for things like CGMs, insulin pumps, supplies and the meds that work for you!
