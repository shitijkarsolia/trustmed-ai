===============================================================================

This is a goofy question for this sub, but I don't have many other options to ask in person or online. But we all have dealt with the bubble guts from medicine or "just because". As I've gotten older, it gets a little more frequent. I was thinking about going the bidet route to help with the clean up problem. It seems like a good idea, and I was curious if any of you folks have any experience/advice. (Yes, I do use probiotics and fiber, yes I've been checked for other issues. It just seems this is a part of getting older, too.) ETA - Thank you for the information and suggestions! I will definitely look at the recommended items this weekend.

When doing a bathroom reno, we chose a toilet that had a matching bidet top, but you can absolutely get a nice enough one on Amazon these days. I'd say you honestly don't even need the fancy temperature control, but it does feel luxurious in the winter to not have a cold booty. 😂

4. u/Lady_Irish [score=3, created=2025-11-10T21:29:49]: I have been spoiled by my bidet. I got a brondell ecoseat s102 a couple years ago, and I hate using toilets without them now. I even went and bought and installed one at my fiancé's house lol

They tie right into your toilet water connection. Simple to install. If you need the other comforts (heated seat, warm water, better alignment with your.....areas) then you might have to go with a nicer brand, and find electrical hookups.

For women, we rinse after we pee as well. The only time we use toilet paper is to dry ourselves off. When my husband and I were still dating, he eventually adapted to the bidet (and an instant pot lmao) and he loved it ever since and never went back. I actually even carry a portable bidet with me on travel or long trips across the US because we really just can't do without it.
7. u/UNZIPT [score=2, created=2025-11-10T23:27:29]: I have an aqua-clean, a Japanese bidet-toilet. Actually, my husband and I have 2, one for each bathroom. After a #2, a wand comes out and sprays water on your hole and retracts. Another sprays water to clean the surface of the toilet. I wouldn’t be without it.
8. u/Artistic_Spring8213 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T23:53:53]: I have a handheld bidet. It's easy to install. I prefer being able to target exactly where to clean. You just need some grip strength for it and make sure that you place it in an easy to reach place (next to the toilet paper, for example). I ordered mine from Amazon.
9. u/cyniclawl [score=2, created=2025-11-11T12:54:42]: I have a basic one with no hot water, I couldn't go back to not having one.
10. u/Ikeamademedoit [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:49:18]: We installed smart toilets in 3 bathrooms and I rarely buy toilet paper now. Ours are also heated toilet seat and water and air temp controls. When forced to use other toilets we both say we dont feel as clean because we dont get a water wash
11. u/Evening_Trash_7063 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T16:58:07]: We just have a cheap one from Walmart and love it.
