===============================================================================

I had a blood test for unrelated issues etc weeks ago and my hba1c was 50mmol/mol which I'm told is diabetic. Although very "mild" at this point. My blood sugar was elevated two years ago but not this much. I weighed 99kg and got little excercise. I'm 57 years old. So on the day I saw that I went on a fairly strict low carb diet. Not keto but only a bit more. I have lost just over 5kg in a bit over month so far. I eat as little sugar as possible and no bread, rice, potato, pasta etc. I've started gym and swimming but not doing enough yet I actually feel better already. I'm much less sleepy in the evenings. Do you think with the blood sugar I had, the sleepyness could have been caused by that? And that I've done enough to help a bit? I know there is a long way to go and it's a lifetime change I'm not on meds at this point. When should I get a new test to see if diet and exercise are enough? I know some of this are questions for my doctor but it's hard to get an appointment!
