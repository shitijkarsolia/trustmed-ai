Hi everyone I wanted to ask yall a question since I am newbie to situation like this one. Thursday I had a really bad hypo, which is rare for me and I was feeling myself passing out ( couldn’t stand, move talk, eat ect…), I used baqsimi everything went back to normal. But the day after my body didn’t felt right, and the whole day I had hypo, whatever I ate the sugar was instantly absorbed, I tried eating a big meal but after doing my usual UI I entered a long 1-2 hour phase of constant hypo where i wasn’t able to eat. Is it normal ? And what should I Do ? For info my diabetes has always been stable I have really good graphics and 6.6 HBA1C

For that reason, you need to eat extra carbs [as per the manufacturer's website](https://www.baqsimi.com/): "When you are able to safely swallow food or drink, your caregiver should give you a fast-acting source of sugar (such as a regular soft drink or fruit juice) and a long-acting source of sugar (such as crackers with cheese or peanut butter)." Also, glucagon may not work until stores are refilled so you need to be very careful to avoid hypos following glucagon use. &gt; I entered a long 1-2 hour phase of constant hypo where i wasn’t able to eat. I am not sure I understand what you mean by that.
2. u/Eyehopeuchoke [score=6, created=2025-11-11T09:48:49]: I was told baqsimi or glucagon shouldn’t be administered by the person themselves. My endo says if you can give it to yourself you don’t need it and should use other means like juice or something to raise the blood glucose levels. Is that information wrong?

Have you contacted your specialist/endocrinologist for advice? Our glucagon response in general is affected in type 1, we never know if and when it will work, but when we administer glucagon it forces hepatic production. Basically your liver pumping out glucose but the baqsimi multiples this effect many times. So get check out by a doc after using glucagon. The stores in the liver might not be replenished yet (again this is one of the processes affected by type 1 anyway so we don’t know how long until things are back to normal ish in top of using glucagon). Hope you’re on the mend and glad you had glucagon with you as you felt yourself passing out.

I ate a full meal at lunch, but I bolused wrong with only 1 additional unit of fiasp. Being affected by the summer heat my blood sugar was dropping fast in less than 1h 30. Being already full I tried not to panick and I tried correcting it with a juice box and some biscuits. After 20 minutes it was still dropping fast, I was already at 60 mg/dL still double arrows down and because it was simply too much food I threw up. Then I took a baqsimi. I immediately regretted it because I felt a horrible cranial pressure, my nostril was burning really bad and I had heart palpitations too. I don't have any medical problems with my heart. It was only a side effect of baqsimi. The heart palpitations stopped after 10-15 minutes but the cranial pressure lasted for about 7 hours. It was so bad I couldn't even keep my head straight. Fortunately, because I didn't have any food left in my stomach after I threw up, my blood sugar came up slowly and it reached a maximum of 334 mg/dL in about 3 hours. And although it wasn't an ideal outcome, it came back in range slowly but steady. So personally I would recommend to take nothing similar to baqsimi and instead take a glucagon injection. To have a headache is bad, but to feel dizzy and then to have these horrible side effects and being panicked at the same time is worse. Never experienced such thing with glucagon injections in my 23 years of type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately glucagon injections aren't available in my country anymore.
