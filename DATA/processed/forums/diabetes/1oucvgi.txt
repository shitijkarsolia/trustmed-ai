===============================================================================

I have been Type 2 since the end of 2023. In that time I have moved from Australia to Germany. I have had issues keeping my numbers down. AC1 is at 10. The Dr here in Germany is not happy about the level of care from my Dr in Australia who basically gave me Novorapid and Good luck keep the numbers down Don't eat anything other than fish and Broccoli. I am taking 100 units per meal minimum and I still cant keep it down. I don't have a huge amount of time for gym as I work full time and go to School every night of the week right after. He is concerned that even at 100 units after a normal meal (Say some spaghetti and meatballs or something) its not enough and he isn't recommending or prescribing more and has suggested to my Endo I be prescribed an insulin pump. The thing is, I don't want it. I don't want to have a thing I need hang on my pants, a tube to not get caught and pull on my belly. Not to mention how hard it would make getting intimate with my wife ect. I'm at a loss and since yesterday when told me this I have been dreading it. Its really made me depressed. I have already suffered with Needle fatigue taking 4 injections a day. I have to really force my self to be compliant.

Not your fault - just need to get with a doctor who knows what to prescribe based on your medical history, type of diabetes etc. I also recommend seeing a certified diabetes educator as well to assist with food planning. Best of luck to you

If I’m not drinking enough water, my numbers stay high. Even though I go hiking, walking or go to the gym almost daily. It actually took me a long time to realize my numbers were high because I wasn’t drinking enough. I am not on a pump and can’t speak to that specifically and I am not saying not to follow the medical advice from your doctor. Of course they know best. I’m just sharing my experience. Make sure you’re drinking enough water.
