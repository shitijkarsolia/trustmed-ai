===============================================================================

Went into the doctor's with what I think is an ulcer, left with diabetes. I have no family history and am 36 at only slightly above average weight. What kind of surprises am I in for now? Has anyone here had a similar diabetes diagnosis seemingly out of nowhere?

Family history doesn't always have to play a part, either. See an endocrinologist, determine what type diabetes for sure. That would be my first step.

She was in excellent shape, worked out every day, ate healthy and had no family history that I recall. Her A1c was higher than mine. Sometimes we’re just unlucky.

4. u/OoSnakin_BitsoO [score=3, created=2025-11-11T11:00:48]: I went into the doctor because I threw out my back and since it was a new PCP they decided to do blood work and my yearly since I was there already and bloodwork came back T2 diabetic my blood sugar was 389. Doctor was surprised that I never had any symptoms at all and still to this day if it wasn’t for the numbers I would never know that I was diabetic. Never had and still haven’t ever had symptoms of high or low blood sugar so it was kind of a mind blower.

6. u/KerryBoehm [score=2, created=2025-11-11T14:13:40]: I’m a very active person. Depending the time of year I log at least 14 miles running or 35 miles biking a week. When I tell people I am Type 2 diabetic they are usually very surprised.
7. u/david_fireman33 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T07:34:09]: I was diagnosed with T2D a year ago at age 35, I already had neuropathic feet &amp; hand pain and that’s what drove to the hospital but a year later now my health has improved, just keep managing your blood sugar and u will be fine
8. u/Ladder-Necessary [score=2, created=2025-11-14T21:10:50]: I was diagnosed at 32 with a "normal" bmi(5'3" 125lbs). I have no family history and tested negative for LADA antibodies. I was also exercising regularly and eating fairly well compared to many of my peers. A1c was 10.4%. Our society just would rather be fatphobic than realize that diabetes impacts a diverse array of people. For me, the diagnosis has made me healthier. I prioritize sleep, care more about stress management, have figured out how to make homemade flaxseed chia crackers I enjoy, and make sure I take walks and don't neglect my workout routine,even on vacation or during holidays. For me, once I figured out the right meds and making small changes based on daily fasting glucose, there haven't been a lot of other surprises.
9. u/EmbarrassedTea1885 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T22:43:17]: I got the diagnosis while pregnant. It sucked.
10. u/The_engineer_Watts [score=1, created=2025-11-13T07:38:27]: Not to disparage your situation but SOMETIMES family history is only 50% accurate. Also, a regular exercise plan will really help.
