===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 3 years ago. It sucks, basically, I eat really really healthy now. I've lost over 50 pounds in the last 3 years and am in the best shape of my life. But eating healthy is soooo boring. I don't cheat because I don't want to die. I've tried some of the diabetic Ice creams out there and they kind of suck. Like so much that after a few bites, I've thrown the whole container away. I'd given up on ever having ice cream or anything like it again. But I do regularly eat the no sugar added yogurt with some protein powder and other supplements all mixed in with a few berries. This has been my go to first meal of he day for some time. My wife saw a commercial the other day about a new ice cream maker the Shark Ninja CREAMi Swirl and how it can turn just about anything into ice cream or soft serve. She bought the machine last week and took my daily yogurt and just froze it. The next night she put it in the Ninja Swirl and made soft serve frozen yogurt for me. OMG, it was better frozen! So good, healthy, safe, no spikes, just good old fashioned frozen yogurt like I use to buy at the ice cream shops. Now I'm making all sorts of different flavors and concoctions. It is super easy to do and clean up, I think to make a batch it takes a few minutes, and to clean up you just rinse it and the pint bowl in the dishwasher. If anyone loves icecream like I do, I'd suggest you try something similar. Has given me a new viable dessert option and when you are a diabetic, any new safe food option that you actually enjoy and look forward to is amazing! https://preview.redd.it/tdhri3fyvn0g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28725bcf03092235346d8bc2cce98e98f49cc7c6
