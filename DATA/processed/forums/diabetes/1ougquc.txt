Some are diagnosed initially as t2 and after further testing, they find out they are actually t1. In the former case people are wrongly equating "using injectable insulin" as being t1. T2 is (putting it most simply) someone who has insulin resistance . .you are still producing insulin, but not using it well. It can be often controlled by diet, exercise and medication up to, and including long and short acting insulin. T1 is auto immune and you just stop making it. T1 needs to have insulin bc we dont have any. Like I said, simplistic. But an easy way to think of it

3. u/Mrs123wife [score=3, created=2025-11-11T11:17:05]: No. Prediabetes, if you are type 1, may indicate that you're in a honeymoon period, but it doesn't just "turn into" type 1. The honeymoon period just means that your pancreas hasn't compeltely failed (yet) and still produces some insulin. Type 2 does not turn into type 1. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where the body's cells attack the pancreas, thus it doesn't make insulin required to surivive. There are 26 types and variations of diabetes, so it's very common that a person is misdiagnosed at first, so sometimes people are diagnosed as type 2, but then they get the bloodwork done and realize it's type 1. Same thing for MODY (genetic diabetes), which requires a specific genetic test. Type 2 can burn out the pancreas, whether from not taking care of the diabetes or from being undiagnosed, or other reasons, like metabolic disease, such as PCOS. Genetics play a massive role in type 2 as well. Once a pancreas burns out the beta cells, the pancreas can't produce insulin that's needed for the (often) insulin resistant body. So, many type 2 diabetics will need insulin to survive. The key to any diagnosis is to be PROPERLY diagnosed. Ask for a referral to an endocrinologist. As for autoimmune blood tests like c-peptide, GAD, etc. and make sure you are getting the proper diagnosis. Fasting glucose of 93 indicates normal fasting BS, but there are too many factors that need to be evaluated to see if you're diabetic.
