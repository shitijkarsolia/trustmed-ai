Anybody have recommendations on shoes for a diabetic with neuropathy? It’s not a constant problem, but it’s getting worse. I also deal with plantar fasciitis that may or may not be related.

Everytime I buy shoes I have to test the tow strength in the shoe as well I'd bend the front of the shoe, if it folds easy stay away from these. You want the shoe to be strong and not bend. Asics, Brooks and shoes with cushions inside are great though they won't stay that way forever you'd likely need to replace 9-12months to keep that bouncy feeling. Also maybe invest in compression socks and ofcourse stay on top of your blood sugars
