===============================================================================

I have been told in the past I have insulin resistance. Im 29 5'2 and about 125lbs. My gyno about idk 3 years ago said I had insulin resistance with some testing she had done and started me on keto. I went from 125-105lbs and we started me slowly introducing carbs and what not in. She ended up leaving the area and after about 1.5 years of keto i started to go back to normal ways. About 2 weeks ago we did labs with my rheumatologist and one was a glucose which the level was 58. I wasnt fasting i had ate a sandwhich and some chips as i have morning meds to take. Labs were at 130pm. Well today i have an appointment with the rheumatologist to go over labs and basic follow up appointment stuff. I also have lupus POTS fibromyalgia..I had asked about the lab and he said it was a fluke and im to young to have diabetes. Wondering if anyone else has been told this? For me it was alarming to have a blood sugar of 58 knowing I wasn't fasting that day either. He wasn't concerned brushed it off like they do.. I feel like its something I want to look into because my dad and his sister both have type 2 diabetes. Just looking for some general advice or input? Should I ask my primary here in town? Rheumatologist is 2 hours away and we did a video appointment for this one. Just feel defeated. I understand it isn't a huge deal but it was a little bit for me. Can insulin resistance cause low blood sugar if not treated? Any advice? Tia

When it's connected to diabetes, what happens is your blood sugar goes too high right after eating and then crashes down a couple hours later. This can happen because the body senses it's not responding to the high blood sugar and then pumps out all the insulin it can, and then the insulin kicks in and causes the blood sugar to drop too much. This can happen because of LADA (slow onset type 1 in adults) or fluctuating insulin resistance (ie you did some exercise after eating that lowered your insulin resistance so all the insulin your body was pumping out could suddenly work effectively). You can pick up a blood glucose meter over the counter at the pharmacy/drug store to check your own blood sugar throughout the day if you are concerned, then bring those numbers to your primary doctor.
