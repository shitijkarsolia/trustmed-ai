Is high glucose making me tired? I’m new to this forum and I don’t understand everything to the extent of others. Here’s my situation. Recently diagnosed with type 2. Been pre-diabetic forever. Male, 50’s, 6’, 350. Started a new glucose monitor. If I don’t eat for 12 hours it will go down to about 180. I’m incredibly shaky at that point. As soon as I eat something with carbs it will shoot right up to 350 or even higher. It’s so high that my monitor tops out at 350 and flatlines on the graph. I’m not eating too crazy just like 2 hamburgers or some slices of pizza or even a baked potato. They just started me on insulin twice a day and they said 8 units but I bumped it up to 10. I’m always exhausted. As soon as my glucose gets close to 350 I become even more exhausted and have to go right to bed. I’m spending up to 20 hours a day in bed just getting up to use the bathroom and eat and then repeating the process. The only time my glucose did not shoot up was when I cooked and ate plain chicken thighs. I didn’t like eating all meat though so was still hungry. I know I need to buy low carb but I have been eating up the carb food I have on hand before I start low carb mode. Any tips for me? I’ve been watching videos of foods to buy and eat but they don’t sound very satisfying. I’m disabled with my back and need easy to eat quick meals I can have on hand to eat before I pass out. I have a new Endocrinologist and Dietician but I’ve only met with each once and then once a month appointments scheduled.

When you have insulin resistance, anything that is processed or things like potatoes will spike. When you consume saturated fats from hamburgers, bacon etc. the fat from it creates insulin resistance in your liver. So you will see high fasting glucose. Also, this fat clogs up your muscles and prevents it from absorbing the glucose leading to muscular insulin resistance. These are very simplified versions of what is actually happening. You need to chose lean meats with as low saturated fats as possible. Even dairy like cheese etc, you can start by choosing low fat versions. The more you avoid these things, the better it is. I would eat chicken, fish of any kind, some eggs like not more than 3, plenty of veggies etc. I know you said you are disabled but you can do resistance training and star with focus on your biceps, triceps, chest. There are also back friendly leg exercises you can pickup. Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat &amp; improves metabolism. Also, some light 30 minute cardio in the morning on an empty stomach &amp; walking for 30 minutes after your meal will help immensely. To make your life easy, look into getting an Instant Pot &amp; an Air fryer. You can not tackle this with diet alone, you have to do a lifestyle change to include exercises to build muscles &amp; burn fat. Feel free to ask any questions.

Also I’ve been replacing sweet treats with keto (no sugar diet) options so look for those products to satisfy that need. But I highly recommend you to avoid burgers and pizza (at least until you have normal levels of glucose) because it’s very bad for this condition. And yeah, for me it’s also very uncomfortable to not have quick options, but I’m sure you are going to find a place that sells healthy options for you, I hope it happens soon :)

Don’t eat “plain” chicken thighs, put some seasoning on it lol. Avoid high sugar sauces like bbq. (there are some good sugar free ones though) Veggies need to be relatively low carb. A good general rule for veggies is if it grows above ground it’s usually ok to eat (there are exceptions, like corn, corn won’t do you any favors). Look up easy low carb or keto foods, SLOWLY introduce carbs back in (but only a small amount and only one thing at a time to see how your body reacts, the CGM is going to be a huge help with this). Even if you get spikes, it’s ok, spikes are normal even for nondiabetics, as long as the spike goes down sub 140 after 1 hour that spike is fine and normal. I understand that right now you may not ever be 140 so just… as long as it goes back down to wherever you started within 60 minutes of the spike you’re on the right track. Eventually your baseline will lower, but it takes time and work. You can do this, but get rid of the Carby foods. Donate them (sell them to a family member/friend if you have to lol) and get better food for you. You know the food pyramid? This doesn’t really apply to you anymore. Try to focus on how you plate your food, go for 1/4 (give or take) lean protein (don’t forget to season!) and the 3/4 of your plate be low carb veggies. If you HAVE to have a carb right now, do it, but severely limit it until you get your baseline to something normal. By limit I mean really limit, 1-2 bites of ice cream MAX, 1/2 a small roll, a single very very small potato. But honestly until you can get that baseline down I’d avoid carbs as much as possible - reintroduce them slowly once you’re out of “I-feel-like-shitsville” 24/7.

I understand you don't want to waste the food you have, but it's going to be that much more difficult adjusting to a low/er carb diet if you're eating nothing BUT carbs and processed food right now. Mix the high carb food with lower carb sides as you play with recipes and figure out what alternatives work for you. A fasting reading of 180 is pretty high - that's actually the peak/highest reading most endocrinologists want diabetics to see post-meal. Ideally you'd want a fasting reading between 80-100, but it may take time and effort to get there because you don't want too drastic of a drop - you may feel a false low/hypo as your levels drop because your body isn't used to what that feels like. A reading of 350+ is high and there's too much sugar in your system, which is why you feel tired/sleepy. I'm not sure where you're located, but (I'm in the US) there are some affordable low carb meals to make. Some require meal prep, or waiting for sales on certain products and stocking up if you can. In the summer I eat a lot of salads, topped with protein (usually frozen chicken strips); now that it's getting colder I'll make soup at home. Healthy Choice has low carb steamed frozen meals that are actually pretty decent; sometimes I'll add extra veggies like broccoli or bell peppers. Frozen veggies are just as good as fresh produce, and worth it if you don't get through produce before it spoils. If you can start working in daily movement, that will also help with managing your blood sugar levels, especially after meals. Walk in place/pace around your home if walking outside isn't safe, and aim to increase how long you move every day/week. If mobility is an issue, maybe movements/exercises you can do while seated/laying down.

Your diet needs be low carb, high protein and lots of green vegetables. Don’t eat up all the carb food first, just get rid of it; this is your health not a “the diet starts Monday” situation. There’s some decent recipe books on Amazon and the diabetes UK website has loads too
6. u/AmbitiousYetMoody [score=2, created=2025-11-12T05:23:22]: I was so, so tired before being diagnosed and at the start of being diagnosed. What helped me stay with all the low carb stuff was the energy I got from it! I felt like I had my life back because I wasn’t sleeping all the time. An idea my dietician gave me is to start adding (low carb) stuff in the beginning instead of subtracting existing carbs. So like add a bunch of broccoli or other fiber to an existing meal to start. That made it easier for me to adjust. Highly recommend a dietitian and CGM! Dietician helped me have carb guidelines that were achievable and within my palette of foods I already enjoyed.
7. u/Consistent_Elk9676 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:24:26]: Quick answer-yes uncontrolled blood sugar absolutely can make you tired. That sugar is not getting into your cells so they don’t get energy. By the same token you are eating foods that cause spikes in your blood sugar. Since you are not using the blood sugar effectively it it just more for your kidneys to try to flush out, so you are in a cycle that just gets you further and further down. You need to see a diabetes educator and a nutritionist asap. Either can help you understand your insulin needs and adjust dose while you are waiting for appointment with the endocrinologist. Are you using both long and short acting insulin?
8. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=2, created=2025-11-13T07:57:24]: You have a lot of issues. I know: I'm a M60+, 6', weighing 374 when diagnosed a year ago with an HbA1c 11%. &gt;I know I need to buy low carb but I have been eating up the carb food I have on hand before I start low carb mode. How do you know that? Did your dietician give you a plan? I adhere to a moderate carb diet working with a dietician, diabetic care nurse, and health coach who I saw weekly. See what resources are available to you through your insurance, health care system, employer, and community health services and milk every one until you're satisfied. Go to the library and look for reputable resources and educate yourself. I have no tips for you. We're all different and while we appear to have a lot in common I don't know what your disability means for you. I have back issues but consider myself "annoyed" by them, not fully disabled. I work around it. But my course was lifestyle overhaul. Eating, activity, and sleep. I went all-in: while I don't strictly count calories or carbs I'm mindful of them. I tightly manage portion control and make meals with low-medium glycemic load. I don't eat meat at all so I adopted a whole food, plant based diet. I informally do intermittent fasting, not eating until 10am and generally not eating after 7pm. While I eat for nourishment I'm a pretty good cook so am generally always satisfied with the taste. I've learned to adapt and eat normal portions which meant getting comfortable not gorging myself like I did before, or mindlessly eating until the plate was empty... or container... I dropped over 100lbs in a year and my back issues are all-but-gone. I need to get checked out by the neurologist again, and likely still have the condition, but it's not causing me debilitating pain anymore. I wasn't able to do stairs and now I go up and down 7 flights without issue. But I started just going down 1 flight at first. Then up 1, down 2. It wasn't easy at first, and sure wasn't fun. Embrace the suck and it quickly passes.
9. u/GrantAZ [score=1, created=2025-11-13T01:50:15]: Is this a decent grocery list? I’m shopping at Costco in Arizona. Anything to add? Costco doesn’t have the best veggies so going to another store for broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.. Chicken Thighs 2 packages. Hamburger. Chuck Roast beef. Spiral Ham (won’t use glaze) Eggs 24 Cheddar Cheese block String Cheese Cottage Cheese Greek Yogurt Chibani Yogurt cups 8gcarbs Irish Butter Greens tub for salad or smoothies Avocados bag 6 Bell Peppers Sweet Potatoes bag Hummus 4 tubs Ahi Tuna cans Pinto Beans 25lb bag Bread low carb Beef Jerky low sugar Walnuts Pistachios I might buy but they are expensive-fresh salmon and frozen Ahi filets. I already have chicken stock, coconut milk cans for Thai soup. I have frozen vegetables and frozen berries. Can I eat? corn tortillas with melted cheddar, corn chips with the Hummus, whole milk, Adele’s Sausages, bananas, apples, protein shakes, supplements? I don’t see my Dietician for another week. She said to buy low carb frozen meals as well.
