Saturated fat has caused insulin resistance in both your liver and muscles. There’s no guessing game here. The first thing you need to do is cut down on saturated fat. Start by removing high fat dairy, cheese, and other similar foods. It usually takes a few days for things to start normalizing. The problem is there’s so much misinformation out there. Everyone focuses on carbs and blood sugar spikes, but few realize that fat plays a big role too. Sure, fat doesn’t directly raise blood sugar, but saturated fat can make your body more insulin resistant, which is what leads to those stubborn numbers. Hepatic insulin resistance is the main reason for Dawn phenomenon. You should also consider adding resistance training. Building muscle helps improve insulin sensitivity, gives your body more room to store glucose, and boosts your metabolism overall.

Do you have access to a dietician who can take all of your current numbers, meds, lifestyle, everything into account and create some meals for you to start trying from there? If not, you should ask your job to sign up for Live Tula, it's been awesome for me. Finally takes away so much of the horrible mental load of constantly monitoring and trying to learn everything from scratch
