===============================================================================

The first pic shows the weight, about 1.74 pounds. And the seconds one shows the content, like 4 small steaks, 3 chicken breast, 2 small potatoes, some chicken heart and some lettuce and veggies. Is this considered too much protein or carbs and maybe even dangerous? Any recommendation on portion sizes? I am 172 cm and 133kg

Many diabetics (some unknowingly) have blood sugar spikes when they consume a lot of protein. As someone on an insulin pump, if I were to eat this plate, I would give myself insulin for the two small potatoes and then 1/2 the insulin for the grams of protein on the plate. It is such an individual disease, you should check your blood sugar a few hours after you eat and see how your body reacts.

We’re also totally different from Type 1 diabetics. You are the only one who can say based on eating and testing or watching a glucose monitor.
