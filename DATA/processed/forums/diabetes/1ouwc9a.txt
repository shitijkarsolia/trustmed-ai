===============================================================================

I am 45 (M) with extremely high libido. However, I am a control freak and always looking for ways and means to keep my sugar levels close to normal (100f/105pp). Recently, I started practicing intermittent fasting and the results have been highly postive in terms of bringing my sugar levels down. However, it has also adversely affected my libido with reduced erections and low sex drive. Is there anyone who faced similar situations and how did you overcome it (no blue pills please)?

If you have your last meal at 8pm and then your next one at 6/7/8am, that is all the fasting your body needs. I'd suggest you go back to a more normal regiment of eating (3-4 meals a day) and control your BG via good food choices and regular exercise if possible. If not, it might be worth thinking about medication. While it is great if you can control diabetes via dietary choices/changes, these shouldn't be so extreme as to cause additional issues. However it is important to keep in mind something else entirely could be causing your current issues. Best of luck!
