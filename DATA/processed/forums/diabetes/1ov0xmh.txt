===============================================================================

I managed to get my sugar down from the 200s down to 83 this morning and staying around this level but for some reason I can't sleep, does anyone have this problem? I'm eating the right foods and even slipping in a little sweets here and there, but i don't feel any better and I can hardly sleep. I don't understand what's happening and could use some advice. Please!

Did you drink any caffeine before bed? Is the temperature at an optimal level? To much blue light from screens? Not enough d vitamin? Is it psychological? Physical? Medications affecting your sleep? I can go on but there is a wide variety of reasons affecting sleep. And since you said that your blood sugar is fine it’s difficult to tell.

How much exercise do you do in a day, or what is your average TDEE? How much water are you drinking in a day? When and how much do you sleep? What are you doing to help fall asleep? What do your morning and evening routines look like

5. u/Dragon3766 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T07:00:55]: Not really sure about the calories probably 1200 or more. Definitely need to drink more water My exercise is kinda limited because of past injuries I lay down when I feel sleepy turn off TV and no external lights which usually works. But this is been 2 weeks of no sleep for 36 hours or more then I pass out from exhaustion. And after I get sleep it starts all over again. It's like I went on the Mars sleep cycle 😆.
