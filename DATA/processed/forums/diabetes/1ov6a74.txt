===============================================================================

I have had diabetes for 20 years and keep my A1C around 5.9-6.3. I’ve o my had 2 events when my sugar dropped to under 60. Yesterday I had a stack of pancakes yes with real good syrup😬 All the wrong carbs and no protein. I freaked out thought I was gonna drop to the floor. I keep a can of coke in my fridge that’s there for emergency. I drank it and after 15 minutes my number was 75. It’s a scary event and we should all be prepared. Please review this link and save it.

What are "wrong carbs" that lower blood sugar? This whole thing reads like a poorly informed AI wrote it.
2. u/pumpkinwafflemeow [score=6, created=2025-11-12T07:23:12]: Regardless of my a1c i keep low snacks on hand since diabetes is so unpredictable. I keep candy on my nightstand juice in my fridge etc
3. u/Davepen [score=9, created=2025-11-12T09:30:26]: Are you on insulin? Or is this reactive hypoglycemia? I've never heard of food actually making your blood sugar go low, I've only seen it if I miscalculated the carbs and gave myself too much insulin.
4. u/New-Programmer7489 [score=4, created=2025-11-12T13:27:22]: Yeah, I don't get it, why does eating a lot of carbs lower you blood sugar and then drinking a lot of carbs raises it.
5. u/Swimming_Director_50 [score=6, created=2025-11-12T11:12:31]: You ate a stack of carbs, with pure sugar on top, then had a coke? We all should be prepared for a low (I keep glucose tabs in the house, my car, my purse) but anyone eating the three things you listed should KNOW you just invited the Furies into your life with that. You should have been eating a protein along with that coke because you're just going to keep rollercoastering with reactive hypoglycemia. Sorry to be blunt, but I think your post is less about warning people to be prepared for lows than it is a cautionary tale for really BAD food choices. If you want pancakes, fine...but use a sugar free syrup. And have some bacon to blunt the spike. And go for a walk afterward (with glucose tabs in your pocket). Positioning this as "friendly advice" is a disservice to people new to the community because you are seemingly blaming the disease rather than some really dumb food choices. Severe lows are not common for T2s and you should discuss this with your doctor (or stop eating in ways that cause them). And yes, lows happen, but this was self-inflicted.

7. u/Dgskydive [score=2, created=2025-11-12T08:08:10]: Always have candy in my pocket. Glucose paste in my workout fanny pack. Yup, I wear one. All of the above in the car. A real soda and juice boxes in the house. Glucose tab bottles in every room. My a1c is 5.2 most of this year. Still want to be prepared. You never know.
8. u/Due_Citron6089 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T10:21:39]: Always. As we head into winter, all my coats/jackets have at least one packet of gummies (15g carbs) in a pocket. I also have a stash by the door and automatically grab one along with the keys/wallet if I’m going out.
