===============================================================================

Wasn't taking my health seriously until I got my leg amputated 3 months ago. At that time my A1C was an 11.2, just got it done again and I am down to a 5.1. I also went from 198 pounds down to 163, so lost 35 pounds, 25 if you don't count the leg, haha! I also went from using 20 units of fast acting per meal down to 3 as of today. Hopefully I will be off of it entirely here soon and then I can start working on getting off of my long acting. Now I just have to wait two more weeks for my leg and I can finally start walking again! Edit for spelling

Diagnosed for 6-7 years but been pre diabetic the majority of my life, so just wondering here. Was 198 your highest weight?

You’ve been through it, so I understand how hard it has been and why your health slipped through the cracks. Although I noticed you previously tagged a post as type 1 and now your tag is type 2. I’m curious, are you type one or two? I also know that in rare cases people can develop type two and be type one. Anyway if you’re type one you’ll need insulin for life. Also you seem like a great dad and your daughter is lucky to have you.
