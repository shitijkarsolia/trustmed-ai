How often do you change your lancet in your lancing device? Honestly, I think I change mine once a year…twice if I am feeling bougie 😂

2. u/psycholee [score=29, created=2025-11-12T17:18:39]: If I don't get a good blood draw I'll reuse it for that instance. But I use a new one for every time I'm testing.
3. u/ProxyLament [score=23, created=2025-11-12T15:45:12]: Every time, without fail. Also try to disinfect the lancing device at least once a month.
4. u/tmccrn [score=17, created=2025-11-12T17:13:46]: Whoa! Seriously every single time!!! Way too much risk otherwise
5. u/Intelligent-Wear-114 [score=34, created=2025-11-12T15:35:34]: Every single time, to avoid the possibility of infection.
6. u/Fit_Vacation_1661 [score=19, created=2025-11-12T16:35:05]: Since they are so fine, they are also delicate. Each time they puncture the skin, they cause microscopic burrs and dents in the needle. Each burr and dent makes the lancets hurt more and require more force to puncture the skin to draw blood. It is recommended to change after each use. I have seen some lancet companies say not to use it more than 2 times.
7. u/Oma2Fae [score=17, created=2025-11-12T16:10:06]: Every time I use a new strip . Yes, even if I'm rechecking to make sure it was right.
8. u/HoneyWyne [score=9, created=2025-11-12T16:20:49]: Every single time. I don't test enough with actual blood to use it again.
9. u/Ikeamademedoit [score=7, created=2025-11-12T17:02:39]: My husband changes the needle every time. There are 5 or 6 needles in the lancette thingy. By memory they are free from our Govt/diabetic program (aussie) but even if not free, he would still change them every time,
10. u/_Abnormal_Thoughts_ [score=37, created=2025-11-12T15:19:39]: Every time. Y'all are nasty. They are cheap, why risk infection because of laziness?
11. u/Locaisha [score=5, created=2025-11-12T19:49:16]: Well now I use the one that has like 5 loaded (I forget the name sorry). So like Everytime but I'm on a pump and my CGM doesn't usually need to be calibrated so I rarely finger stick anymore.
