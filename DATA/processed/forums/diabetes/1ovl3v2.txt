===============================================================================

Hi all - I (36M) just got told I officially have type 2 diabetes today. I feel somewhere between completely numb and totally freaking out. Reading some of the posts in here today definitely helped a little bit but there’s just SO much information that it’s overwhelming. Having a moment of true grief, mourning what could have been, things I could have done to keep this from happening, etc, while also feeling shame and disappointment in myself and guilt for my amazing wife and how supportive of me she always is. DISCLAIMER: I’m in touch with reality enough to understand I’m being super dramatic and that this is not a death sentence at all. I could just use some compassion, some guidance on where to start, any helpful tips, stories….books maybe?? Truly anything that I can begin with. I do have a relative plan to change diet and exercise but can always use a refresher and advice. I’m an open book. This just feels so daunting and like my life will never be the same. My friendships and relationship all love and move around food a lot, as a lot of others do, so that certainly doesn’t help. Kind of lost, searching in the dark and looking at this community for some hopium and copium lol.

Sometimes when talking to strangers or more distant relatives where I don't feel like dealing with Diabetes drama then and there so I say, "My doctor said to keep my blood sugars under control." It's the part they need to know. Do let them know before they buy one of those huge Costco cakes.

I understand what you mean, the day my husband was diag the Dr made out that he would drop dead on the walk to the car from her office. Now we know more and hes going to be fine. We use a daily food diary to count every protien, carb and fat and record numbers. It really helps. Also find new recipes to enjoy and try to use as much whole food as possible. ie, lots of veggies, portioned protiens, avoid packaged foods and chemicals. If possible, invest in a diabeties dietician to help you. We've added greek yoghurt and olive oil to his diet because of ours. Invest in a food scale if you dont already have one. And happy birthday. As I tell my husband, its not no forever, its just no for now. You can enjoy things occassionally but we have to work now to make that safe for you/us

I couldn't even take a blood sample (high blood sugar makes your blood sticky) and when I did I didn't even understand the numbers. It was terrifying. My nurses explained it all and put me on some good drugs You need to get a blood glucose monitor, I recommend you jab yourself in the morning when you wake up, before meals and at least 2 hours after meals. You can get a continuous glucose monitor but they are more expensive though they are useful for tracking blood sugar throughout the day so you can understand the relationship between food and glucose levels. Your hba1c test will get done every three months until your blood sugar is well managed This chart is useful, you should aim to be in the green https://pitstopdiabetes.co.uk/resources/resource/hba1c-chart/ It might take time to reduce and get there but don't panic, diabetes can have long term complications if your blood glucose remains high for long periods over a long time if you focus on reducing your blood sugar over the next few months then you are on the way to recovery You have to reduce your carb intake, the big four are white versions of rice, pasta, potatoes and bread but that doesn't mean you have to go hungry, starving yourself is unhelpful. Obviously pizza, pastries, crisps are off the table for now. I eat stir fried veg, fish, meat, quark (like Greek yogurt), eggs, cheese, spinach, and I eat chia seed pudding in the mornings (chia seeds, Stevia, cinnamon powder, milk, and almond extract - mix leave in fridge for a couple of hours or overnight). I occasionally eat wholemeal bread - eggs on toast. I switched to Stevia instead of sugar. The solution will be a combination of drugs (everyone gets Metformin but there are others too they are all good) and diet and exercise if you can, just walking after meals helps the post meal spike. Reducing saturated fats in my diet was really helpful. I use an app loseit to track nutrients. It's immensely helpful I aim for Carbs - less than 130 grams per day Sat fats - less than 20 grams per day Fibre - at least 30 grams per day (fibre doesn't convert to blood sugar hence chia seeds 90% fibre - they expand so not dry). Hemp hearts are incredible and full of healthy fat and go well with yoghurt or quark. When your blood sugar levels are back under control you can reintroduce carbs back into your diet, type 2 diabetics can eat mostly everything in small quantities. If you are a habitual snacker or sweet eater you are likely to crave and thats okay just make the distance between snacking longer and longer each time. You probably didn't want war &amp; peace just wanted to say I've been there and it gets better

Can’t give you real advice since I am a T1 but I just wanted to spread some positivity and that no matter what remember you are not alone. You can win this battle, diabetes is a load but the more you walk the less it will feel heavy. Keep walking and never stops even in tough days Sending you all the love and strength
5. u/DefyingGeology [score=4, created=2025-11-12T18:03:07]: Hey, welcome to the club! First thing: you’re going to be ok. For sure. You’ve got this, it’s manageable. Second: you don’t have to figure this all out right now. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Heck, not even a marathon: it’s literally the rest of your life. There’s room to mess things up in the beginning before you get them sorted out! Third: enjoy your birthday! You’re going to make long term changes and get everything under control, and no single day or single meal is going to kill you. That’s the advantage of type 2 over type 1, to be fair: left unmanaged, T2 makes for a horrible death, but thankfully, it takes a long time to get there, and the fact that you’re here in this group, asking for help, so soon after diagnosis, that’s a really good indicator that you’re not going to be going out that way. One of my favorite statistics that I’ve read on this journey is that people with t2 who manage it, and keep their glucose under control, actually live longer lives than the general population. So if you want to, you can get this wrapped up and under control and be just fine. Last thing, the time frame: the first few weeks are rough and it’s totally ok to go through all the emotions, and shame, and grief or whatever. Then you’ll take a few months to get your best practices in line and under control. By about six months, you’ll see positive results and start testing better and feeling better, and the whole exercise becomes easier and you get more confident about things. So: hang in there. Don’t panic. Keep reading this sub. All the answers are here! And good luck.

First, I significantly lowered my carb intake. I mainly ate protein and greens. Then, I slowly reintroduced healthy carbs and made sure to pair them with protein. Protein helps slow the digestion of sugars. Whenever I "cheated" or got caught slacking, I had a cup of protein powder to mix with water, which I would have with my cheat meal. For example, a heavy bowl of cereal would cause my blood sugar to hit 180. However, if I have a protein shake before eating the cereal, my blood sugar would only rise to 140. I went from type 2 diabetes into remission in one year without any exercise. From 220 pounds down to my college weight of 180. Everyone is different, so you really need to track your reactions two hours after every meal until you understand which foods cause you to react in what ways.

Then google the name of it and add the word diabetic. Now, not everything is going to work for you, but it will move you in the right direction. Basically, we cook most things now and use very little prepared foods. Everyone is different though, so work towards your specific likes and figure out what works for you. With the exercise, figure out what you like to do/fitness level appropriate. You don't need to start training for 3 iron man's a year. :)
8. u/ScotianSweet86 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T20:30:30]: If you’re able I’d suggest getting a CGM, I prefer the Dexcom G7 but the Libre is another option. It was the biggest tool for me after I was diagnosed, you can see in real time how certain foods and activities affect your glucose levels. In my case 2% milk is the absolute worst thing, I can drink a can of pop or eat a chocolate bar and my sugar won’t go as high as having a bit of milk. Also- The number one thing that drives me INSANE is the people who think that just because you’re diabetic, that you cannot eat. My mother used to drive me so crazy.
9. u/helldvr [score=3, created=2025-11-12T16:32:51]: Its not the end of the world. Just a change in life style and mentalities, especially on food. You'll be fine. Go to an endocrinologist and make a game plan, baby steps at first make a huge improvement quick if you're consistent. This is a great resource, but the best advice I've got here is "eat to your meater." Everyone has different carbs their body handles in different ways. Learn which way you test your sugars and go from there. I use a constant glucose monitor that stays in my arm. Couldn't live without it.
10. u/eliota1 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:21:01]: Just got my diagnosis three weeks ago and I understand the shock. I had my first round of education and initial drugs. Exercise and the right diet seems to be pretty effective at least for Type 2. The education and reading seemed to say that your life is changed but not as much as you think. There is a ton of good information on line. Finally, you can still eat what ever you want, but not as much and timing of meals and snacks count.
11. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T20:49:30]: Diabetes is manageable and is nothing to be ashamed of. It does force a lifestyle change, where you’ll focus your meals more on protein and fiber and less on carbs that dont give you the nutrients that you need. You’ll start to see food as either fueling and nourishing you, or as putting too much sugar into your blood. You’ll change your portion sizes of things like birthday cake, but still enjoy traditions with your family and friends.
