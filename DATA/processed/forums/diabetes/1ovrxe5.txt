===============================================================================

I'll keep this as short as possible. I am 35 and was diagnosed with T1 in my mid-20s. I maintained pretty good control for many years, with my A1C bouncing between 5 and 6. I went off the rails a couple of years ago after developing severe anxiety over hypos (specifically one that occurred just after a basal injection, which mortified me) and as a result, began letting my BG run far too high. I finally started seeing a therapist a few months ago to deal with this and have gotten less afraid of taking my insulin and been more aggressive. Two months ago my A1C was nearly 15 (yeah, *I know*) but I have since brought it down to 10 and am continuing to make progress. In the last week,, I have begun experiencing pretty noticeable numbness in my feet (specifically around my big toe, especially on my left foot) and tingling/pins-and-needles/burning sensations. When my BG was at its worst, I had occasional foot irritation but not this level of sensations, specifically the numbness. It really alarmed me because it seemed to come out of nowhere and I know that my A1C is going in the right direction. I did some reading and it appears that some people experience something known as "treatment-induced diabetic neuropathy" which comes on when A1C levels are lowered more than 2-3% in a relatively short timespan. I suspect this is what I am experiencing as it seems to make sense with the timing of things. What scares me is that in many people's accounts of this phenomenon, they describe it as becoming unbearably painful and I fear that as my BG improves, the pain/numbness is going to get much worse. I read that the suggestion for avoiding TIND is to lower the A1C gradually (i.e. around 2% every three months or so), but at that rate it would take me far longer than I'd like to bring things back to some semblance of normalcy. I am seeing a diabetes educator this week to help further get myself on track and am wondering if they may be a good resource to talk about this. I see my endocrinologist again in a little less than two months. Based on the timing and progress, I cannot help but think that TIND is what I am experiencing. Strangely, I'd never heard of it before, nor has my endocrinologist ever mentioned it. I am curious if anyone else here has experienced this and has any insight or stories. As I said, it seemed to come on out of nowhere and it frankly really freaked me out.

Was ignorant about diabetes at the time, initial symptoms were unintentional weight loss, dry mouth, frequent urination, heavy legs. No feet issues at all yet. Made immediate changes to diet- heavily cut back on carbs, quit all sugary foods, drinks etc., started taking metformin (and later long-acting insulin) May- about 5-6 weeks after diagnosis, seeing improvement with my BS, but neuropathy kicks in with my feet. Quickly gets so bad at night that I can't sleep anymore, feet feel like they're on FIRE. Doctor writes a prescription for gabapentin, which helps significantly and allows me to sleep/function again. October- A1C is down to 4.7 six months after diagnosis. I talk to my doctor and stop taking the gabapentin to see if I can go without it now. It's been 6 weeks without medication and my feet are doing great- sleep is good, no signs of neuropathy anymore.

3. u/TheMaxSkull [score=1, created=2025-11-13T05:51:09]: I went from 13.5 to 6.1 in 1 month and I have been having the worst neuropathy known to man kind in my feet , I can’t walk at all
4. u/FONMastr [score=1, created=2025-11-13T09:48:24]: I also experienced a quick drop (14.5 to 5.4) in 3 months, which I believe to be TIND. For me, the endos and neuros that I met with didn't have a great deal of exposure to TIND, and it's been a bit of a walk in the woods. One thing to watch out for is muscle loss, which has contributed to some of my tingling and prickling symptoms as well. (They've shown up in my trunk.) I've found that rebuilding muscle has been more challenging than I expected, so be sure to do that work as well.
