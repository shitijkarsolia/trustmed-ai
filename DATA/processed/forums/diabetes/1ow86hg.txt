===============================================================================

My A1c is now 11.3. My GP wants me to see my endo about switching to insulin. I’ve lost 125lbs in an effort to improve a1c when we thought I was still type 2. I am really worried about gaining weight with insulin. I know someone who is 1.5 and taking insulin and Ozempic. Is there anyone who is 1.5 and takes ozempic or oral meds along with insulin? Also is the an insulin that causes at least less weight gain?

I've been type 1 (edit: typo, wanted to say since I was 5, but somehow ended up writing type 5, which is not a thing) since I was a kid and was around a bunch of other type 1 diabetics and nobody put on weight. Some say that you don't quite feel full as easily, but your milleage may vary. Insulin is likely not going to be the root cause of putting on weight. Note that type 1.5 is not really an official diagnosis, at the end of the day you are still type 1, it's just a slow onset.

5. u/Graveyardhag [score=1, created=2025-11-14T05:34:45]: Insulin can make you gain weight, but ONLY if you also have insulin resistance. I have this particular issue, and I have extreme insulin resistance. It can also help a type 1 gain healthy weight when they've been Ill and losing weight before diagnoses. Because their body stops eating all their fat reserves and starts functioning properly with insulin on board. Insulin doesn't in and of itself, cause weight gain. As a 1.5 you will eventually need insulin no matter what, and it seems the time is now.
