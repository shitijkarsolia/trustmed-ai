So annoying. I woke up to my sugars being 92 and it showed a steady 92 throughout the night. So I thought ooooh I want an English muffin then I go drink water and 5 minutes later my sugars are at 150 😂😂 and I am like well I guess it is just eggs for me now lol. I hate the dawn phenomenon!!! Then I get depressed the rest of the day because I am very anal about my A1c staying low

I bolus for that if I'm on a different schedule that day, but usually if i get up at the same time then I have a basal rate set just for that. and my i:c ratios are different in the morning as well. It's a struggle setting exact basal rates for dawn phenomenon, then feet on floor syndrome, it's like one thing after another. Pumping has made that portion of the day a bit smoother.

4. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=0, created=2025-11-13T13:27:37]: Two things I do to start the day: * Immediately upon waking I set a 10 minute timer. I do a quick check of the news and go to the restroom. When the alarm goes off I do the Radio Taiso workout: a 3 minute light exercise routine * Then I set a 20 minute timer. Empty the dishwasher, futz around, whatever, then do a 15 minute walk or ride on the indoor bicycle trainer. Am thinking of getting a walking pad for when the snows come. If I have lots of time and energy I'll extend to 30 minutes. * Then I'll take 10 minutes to relax and check my BP and blood glucose levels. I'm not a morning person, thus the need for the alarms. Like you I'm committed to managing my HbA1c and am doing what I can to achieve reversal of the condition.
