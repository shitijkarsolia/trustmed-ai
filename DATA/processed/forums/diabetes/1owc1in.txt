===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I (F 28) have been dealing with a problem and would appreciate any kind of advice. Last year my a1c was 5.1 and fasting blood sugar 78. Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed agoraphobia. In October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.

Keep in mind potatoes, rice, and pasta containers high amounts of carbs (sugar) too and limit them as much as possible. Don't cut them out completely since we need carbs to survive. But prioritize protein and fibre rich foods. Check your a1c in 3 months or so and whatever else your doctors recommend

Generally, they tell us that becoming diabetic is a one way street, but we're not doctors, we're sufferers. It is normal for non-diabetics' blood sugar to fluctuate. If you're doctor thinks your excursion into high blood sugars was a fluke, then maybe it was.

A 30-minute walk after a meal can really help blood sugar. If you can do that even a few days a week it can certainly help. Ask for a referral to a nutritionist, they can be helpful as well. Ask about medication. Metformin has been prescribed for decades and can help. GLP-1s also have been shown to be highly beneficial for blood sugar (small doses, even microdoses, work for sone).

Usually with diabetes if you are diagnosed you are diagnosed. It typically doesn’t just go away. Does diabetes run in your family? You may not need medication or anything but it would be something you need to continuously monitor.
