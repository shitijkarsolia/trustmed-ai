===============================================================================

I ate a salad, people. A SALAD!!! For context, I went slightly low after a run, pump wouldn’t let me bolus so I started eating and then forgot until like 20 minutes later. So I had negative IOB plus wolfed down this meal. Still chasing it. Diabetes is so fun. I’m sure it’ll come crashing down any minute now and I’ll be crushing skittles 😂

Negative IOB is always such a dick as well because it just *seems* like you need to increase your hit. You don't of course... but you should. Well, at least you have the excuse to crush a few skittles. Remember when they were a "treat" and not a medical intervention? Why not make them both? haha
