===============================================================================

So I just moved in with my partner, and he lives in a townhome with three levels. I've been having this problem since I moved in where my blood sugars STAY LOW to the point that it's kind of freaking me out. Today, just to keep my blood sugar up I've eaten absolutely ridiculous things I'd never eat. My friend thinks that all the extra movement up and down the stairs is to blame. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm literally trying to talk to my endo about maybe bringing down my dose. I can't keep eating like this everyday just to not tank my BSug too low. Help!

So if you are using insulin or meds to lower BS levels, you are going to need to adjust them with your doctor. I noticed after my hip replacements, that I was moving much more, taking stairs without calculating how to save trips up and down stairs when there was no pain to deal with, and my BS levels stayed in the 80 to 110 range, instead of the 120 to 140s range when I wasn't moving as much because of the hip and back pain.

I can wake up at 5 (90) yet the moment i get in my chair and start moving around it drops (though it will also rocket when I'm outside and pushing going up a hill, and then plumit shortly afterwards having used up the boost to get myself up the slope). So yes being more active then you are use to can lower glucose levels at first unit you get use to it, but it can also be a chronic issue that your body can't adapt to and you need to figure out better options to keep levels stable.

We want my husband to have a lower BG so I tell him to go walk our stairs a couple of times per day, if he cant get outside to walk
