Hi, so to preface, I don’t have diabetes and I'm not super knowledgeable about the correct terminology (please correct me). My boyfriend moved to Australia this year and has diabetes, and he's unsure where to buy this kind of product. I tried researching online, but I wasn’t sure how reputable the websites were. I would really appreciate it if someone could help guide me on what to do or where to find them. Or is this something he should see a doctor about and have them recommend a brand?

Diabetes terminology can sometimes feel like a whole new language, especially for people who are newly diagnosed or for those of us supporting someone who is. I came across a really clear resource that breaks down common medical terms, acronyms, and even some of the community slang that often comes up in conversations. I thought it might be helpful for others too. Here’s the link if you’d like to check it out: [Diabetes Medical Terms](https://notjustapatch.com/diabetes-medical-terminology/)

Many pharmacies there stock CGM supplies too. And if he needs something to help keep sensors on, Not Just a Patch (NJAP) works great.
