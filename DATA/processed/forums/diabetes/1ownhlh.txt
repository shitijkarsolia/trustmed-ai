===============================================================================

My daughter is 4 and she is terrified of the sensors. We’re new to them and I’m trying to find a way to get it on her that doesn’t traumatize her. The last 2 times I had to have my husband hold her so I could get it on and she was too scared of me to even come near me for the rest of the night. Taking it off was just as bad as putting it on. I don’t know how to put a new one on she has full blown panic attacks if I even touch her receiver at this point, but her blood sugar also tanked today at her friends house and I didn’t know because she doesn’t have a monitor on. I know when she’s older she will understand how important it is but right now she doesn’t get that I don’t have an option. I fucking hate this it breaks my heart that she has to deal with this for the rest of her life.

Get some noise cancelling headphones, like they put on children at concerts. Pick out a treat. Maybe she wants to collect bracelets. Get a new stuffy to hold. "I want to make this easier for you, what would help make it easier for you.". IDK, but maybe there are YouTube videos of kids doing it like champs. I'm sorry you are all having to go through this.

And when my daughter had to do her blood draws (she has pku) we would let her do the same. It made it sort of silly, honestly. But they both felt a little in control of the situation.

Maybe ask her what sticker she’d like daily on her sensor or offer her holding her teddy bear or something of comfort that can be in the room with her. Baby talk is best, she’s scared and needs a soft voice. Plus she’s hitting the point where her hormones are going crazy as well as being a diabetic. She’s going through a crazy time, whatever your solution is, good luck ❤️
4. u/Mimolette_ [score=9, created=2025-11-14T00:54:52]: I would try to approach it like it’s no big deal. She’s probably sensing you’re nervous about it, and feeding off that energy. It’s no criticism of you, it’s very understandable to be nervous about it at the start because it’s important to get it on her and it can be tough. But it actually doesn’t hurt much and is quick. I would treat it just like making her put her shoes on or whatever. No dramatic build up, waiting to be ready, etc. Get it all set up and tell her it’s time for the sensor with a big smile on as if you’re doing something fun and just do it quick. Then once it’s on say yay and do a dance or something to distract her from the minor pain. Then she gets to pick a sticker or something else fun, and move on quickly.

She'd zone out on that and I get it done. She eventually got used to it and just watches to make sure we do it correctly.

If you can, apply one to yourself and show her, look, it's okay, Mama or Dada can put the thing on, it is loud and scary, but if mom and dad can handle putting one on, it might help her recognize that it's something good if her closest influences can tolerate it. The application is really more startling than it is painful, even my bf jumped when I was putting on a fresh sensor for the first time around him lol. You might even be able to have them send a replacement if you tell the company it was faulty or didn't connect properly ( I know most companies process claims like that differently so if it's not something you can do that's understandable.) I can't imagine how stressful this must be for everyone, I hope this helps, good luck with everything 💗
7. u/MrMontgomery [score=3, created=2025-11-14T02:57:56]: When I was diagnosed 37 years ago I was shit scared of having to stick a needle into myself and the thing that helped me was the fact that one if the diabetic nurses actually showed me that it wasn't painful by sticking a syringe needle into her stomach, could you maybe try applying a sensor to yourself to show your daughter that it's all ok?
8. u/AmazingAd192 [score=3, created=2025-11-14T04:44:55]: Be calmer than calm in yourself. Don't be tense trying to act calm. And don't drag it out over time by thinking that it's kinder to go slowly. It's kind of a rip the band-aid situation where the worry is worse than the actual event. Try to notice when they're a bit distracted and less tense. If the body part is tense, it's a little more painful.
9. u/Specialist-Can-6176 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T23:41:24]: Take her or meet up with a elder woman who can show her how to be cool about it
10. u/Working-on-it12 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T05:06:27]: Look into adhesive remover. I have a spray that dissolves the adhesive so it doesn’t hurt removing the sensor. It takes longer to change them, but may help. Let her pick out the patches. Mine have VanGogh images on them. Can you let her pick where they go?
11. u/OrugaMaravillosa [score=2, created=2025-11-14T08:22:09]: Seeing that other people wear them might help make it less scary. Someone else mentioned that there are videos of toddlers putting them on? I wonder if some of those toddler videos would help? Especially if there are any where the toddlers are acting happy or silly. Make a playlist of the best ones so you don’t accidentally get a scary one. There are also kids books. I have no idea how good these are or what they talk about but some are: * My Body Beeps!: Growing Up With Diabetes * Perfect The Way I Am: Learning to love what makes you unique (shows a monitor on her arm) Just search for diabetes children’s books and you’ll see more titles. Searching diabetes doll on Amazon pulls up a doll with a glucose monitor. Are there any family acquaintances that wear a monitor?

Maybe show her some videos of other T1D doing sensor changes. I follow quite a few T1D parents on instagram. We do lidocaine for site changes but maybe try it for Dexcom. People also ice or the buzzy bee. Hang in there.
