===============================================================================

Over the past couple weeks my left pinky toe has been feeling numb. I’ve recently started a new job back in July where I’m on my feet majority of the day 10 hour days 4 days a week. But over the last two weeks my pinky toe has been feeling numb. But after walking a little bit at my job the numbness goes away after i “warmed up” walking around doing my morning routine. I’ve been on and off dieting wise i won’t lie but im no where close to weight i was when i was first diagnosed 10 years ago. Still ways to go but better physically. I scheduled my doctor appointment for the beginning of December. But is there anything in the mean time i can do to at least help with this? im worried I’m not going to lie I’m mad at myself for letting it get this far…
