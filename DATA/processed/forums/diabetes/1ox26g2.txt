===============================================================================

After years of awful doctors I went through, who wouldn't listen to my struggle with diabetes. I finally got an endo who diagnosed me with Type 1.5, over type 1. In my early 20s I struggled so hard on keeping my blood sugar leveled, until I was 23 and had my sugars go over 400 night after night, until about new years before I turned 24, where I switched full time to a keto diet. Ive been on a keto diet for almost 5 years now, but my last appointment with my new endo prescribed me metformin again (I was taken off it entirely bc I was told it wouldnt work when I was 20, even tho I kept telling my previous endo I had insulin resistance issues and he wouldn't help me with type 2 meds in the slightest). Anywho, within the past couple years, it's become increasingly difficult to sustain being on keto anymore. I haven't taken my metformin that I was prescribed in september, mostly because 1. too scared to try it yet 2. I wanna build up a supply of metformin before I start 3. In the past couple months I was able to consistently keep my sugars below 200 majority of the time. I wanna transition out of keto so bad. I have to eat a lot of food, especially meat, because Ill get severe hunger pangs if I don't. To the point that I believe it's affecting my blood pressure negatively. I have to eat a lot of salt, so I don't get those low blood pressure symptoms. And I think now I'm starting to have my blood pressure go from high to low, a lot. Here's some points about my current medical situation 1. Im on an insulin pump (endo wants to try out me with my insulin pump on with 0.9 hourly basal) 2. I was prescribed 500mg slow-release metformin pills that Im supposed to take once a day. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if I have to take it really slow.

What has worked for me is to add in a small amount of high fiber carbohydrates: beans, lentils, low carb sola bagel, potatoes etc. just a serving. Old me would have the carbs be the star of the meal. Nowadays it’s like ONE piece of regular bread with an egg cheese and turkey sausage etc and I’m great. I’m not a Dr/ this isn’t medical advice.
