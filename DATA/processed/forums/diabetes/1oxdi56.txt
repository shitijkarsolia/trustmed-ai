===============================================================================

So I was diagnosed as a diabetic last year, so this is my second year of dealing with it, and it was really bad in the beginning 😭 I am 20, diagnosed 19. I need meal ideas from people are are just like me, I do research and everything but I get so overwhelmed sometimes I just default to “ maybe I just won’t eat “ and I know that’s not healthy. I would like just overall support if possible, I want to keep my sugar normal and possibly lose weight hopefully. ( but it’s not my first intention) I just get so stressed, please just tell me a little of what you eat that works. ( I’ll keep doing research too)

I lean on quick meals like eggs, yogurt + fruit, chicken and veggies, or a wrap with some protein. Nothing perfect, just balanced. You’ll get the hang of it, and you’re already doing great by reaching out.
