===============================================================================

Went super low while driving home this morning from work. Dexcom went off and said I was at 55 and then less then 2 minutes later i was at 41. Managed to pull over into a gas station and took 4 glucose tablets and a bunch of snacks. Never gone this low before. It was terrifying. Felt like the whole world was closing in around me.

2. u/MightyDread7 [score=3, created=2025-11-14T18:10:39]: Are you on insulin? Lowest I've ever pricked is 60, and it feels so terribly cold. Feels like I'm naked in snow. Though I always know if I'm mid-70s if I start feeling cold. My body kicks in adrenaline but the metformin blunts my liver too much I think. I have this irrational fear that if I don't treat it ill keep dropping even though logically I don't think I will since I'm not on insulin
