===============================================================================

I have had type 1 since 2006 at 7 years old and have never felt my lows. The lowest I have ever gone was 28, which resulted in me falling and splitting open my lip at 8 years old, which helped me/my family realize I was unable to feel them. Thankfully, the other night, I was able to see myself physically shaking and knew something was up. I was eating a late meal with my partner and could barely hold my fork up with how bad I was shaking. I try very hard to stay within my target zone but have been much more active this week with moving to a new apartment, and it has had my blood sugar all over the place this past week. I am no longer on a pump and use pens to inject/prick my finger to check where I’m at. After this scare, it’s safe to say I finally want to go on a glucose sensor. Has anyone else dropped this low? How did you feel, if so?

Hypo unawareness is no joke, and big changes like moving can definitely throw things off. A CGM would give you so much peace of mind with alerts. You’re definitely not alone , I’ve had lows in the 30s before with barely any symptoms too.
3. u/poopy-md [score=4, created=2025-11-14T20:01:26]: Yes, please get a sensor, I tried since I was first diagnosed to get one asap and it helps life out so much to the point it's detrimental to go without. I've been on MDI for two years and been feeling quite comfortable for the most part. But lows suck, for me my vision will go slowly but I'll also feel how thin my blood is and it'll give me a headache, that and when my body hurts for no reason is how I know I'm high. One time I accidently basal'd into a vein and dropped super fast and would have probably passed out if I didn't notice my tunnel vision and vision change
4. u/AngryGoose [score=4, created=2025-11-14T21:02:03]: I would be incapacitated at that level. Once I hit about 60 I'm sweating and shaking. I'm used to running high though. I don't feel anything at 500+

6. u/caliallye [score=2, created=2025-11-14T22:01:59]: Pretty much the same as you say. I was running around backstage and didn't even know it. I've also gone to around 28, but that was after I thrashed around on the ground a bit. That said, I have my CGM alert me at 85, because I can drop so fast, that if I wait until it's going straight down at 70, it will go below 47 in a minute. I specify 47, because I usually DO have a "tell" Besides the shaking and getting kind of snappy, I will start seeing things like sun blindness, except it grows into two yellow golden or whitish with purple outlines in a yin yang shape, which grows into a tunnel (when I start wondering if this is the famous "golden tunnel" people talk about).... I can't see through it. Then I start shaking and spasming. I said "usually" if I'm really busy, I just have enough adrenaline I guess to not have the vision thing going on. These days I'm told I'm doing really good, but that's because I start treating at 85 if the arrows are pointing downwards, turning of my insulin of it hasn't already down so itself.
7. u/ShaxxsSon [score=2, created=2025-11-14T22:41:27]: I've dealt with hypo unawareness before. I had a similar event make me get a CGM. I had dropped to 49 one night and had no bodily indication anything was wrong. I only checked my level that night out of habit. It's a scary thing, I could've just gone to bed with my sugar that low and have been none the wiser. I think my hypo unawareness was caused by my body being used to it. I was still on insulin at the time (I'm T2) and really didn't know anything about carb ratios. Now that my numbers are a lot more stable I actually feel it when I get the occasional low.
8. u/babbleon5 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T23:09:52]: OMG. I'm in full lizard mode at that point, sweating.and inhaling anything with carbs.
9. u/Mont_Bkk [score=1, created=2025-11-14T19:39:43]: Yes me! It was because i can not manage my glucose that well for many years. My body stop giving signal of hypo. If u can take control it and stable for 3-4 months, your signal of going into hypoglycemia will automatically come back. Pls consult your physician and follow. I am alergic to GCM and insulin pump after 2 years of using, it inflames. Now back to the old school process. Prick my fingers 3-5 times a day and insulin pen baby! Felt way better and my body tells me when i am going hypoglycemia even when sleeping. Its us who needs to manage our body not physician. Best of luck you can do it.
10. u/mr_Astra1 [score=1, created=2025-11-15T01:34:32]: The lowest I got was 30 but I've seen my dad reach 26 ones I think I should buy him the sensor too because he can't feel it anymore idk why it might be because of aging. He falls asleep when he's low sometimes
