===============================================================================

I just recently got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and I’m going to be honest: I 100% know it’s my fault. I’m 241 pounds at nearly 19 years old, and I don’t really do much. I’m not a fan of shit like vegetables, and my entire teenage years has been filled with me just- vegging. As a child, I was really, really active. Ballet, Tap, Piano, Girl Scouts, Swim Team, soccer. Not all at once, but I was in at least 2 things, and my weekdays were mostly spent out of the house until after dark. I ate relatively healthily (well- relatively is a strong word) and I was in the correct weight bracket for my age… until COVID hit. I’d everything but Girl Scouts right before it, just not having motivation anymore. But we still lived in a fairly large house in a safe neighborhood. Then, right around my 13th birthday, we moved. We moved from a large 2 story in a safe, child- filled neighborhood with sidewalks and bikes everywhere, to a 1 story less than a third of the size of our old house, in a neighborhood that despite having a tone of children, has no sidewalks and most everybody parks on the curb, even if there is space in the driveway. It’s not safe to ride bikes or scooters, and hardly safe enough to walk a dog or just take a walk. And again, COVID started up right after we moved, so me and my family were cooped up in this new, small, strange place, all 8 of us (5 people, 3 dogs). Mom stopped going to CrossFit, dad got laid off and went back to his old job as a car salesman. My sister was at a friend’s house all the time, and my brother was moving out to live with his girlfriend. I had no friends to escape to, or hang out with, and my Girl Scout group rarely saw eachother outside of meetings, which happened 2 times a month. I put on a lot of weight VERY quickly, shooting from roughly 100 pounds at 13 to 140 at 14, and it kept increasing. I went from a junior 7 to an adults 12 in less than 4 years, and then from a 12 to a 18 in less than 3. It’s not great, and it’s not healthy. I know I could have done better. Joined a sport, a club, anything to fix my situation, get myself out of the house, and take more than 600 steps a day for a year. School started up, and those numbers barely changed. I was taking 5000 steps a day, but other than art club (where I was sitting on my ass the whole time), I didn’t really go anywhere. And yet, I found myself happiness, so I figured I was doing something right despite my physical weight. Then, my doctor got concerned. My A1C was high for my age, and my weight was 220 at only 17 years old. I hadn’t even graduated highschool yet, and my doctor feared the worst for me. She told me I needed to fix things, and I had a mental breakdown in the parking lot. I tried to change things. My mother and I looked at alternative brands, ingredients. I stopped eating canned chili (used to be my favorite thing) bc the sodium in there was more than a ramen packet. We tried cutting sodas from the house, I tried to go to the gym, or do home exercise videos, and walked more. But nothing stuck. Mom and I both had lives to live outside of that. Journey, and it kept getting pushed to the side. Without my mother to guide me, I was lost and unmotivated, and started to hate my body again. What people don’t tell you is that it’s hard to get yourself out of a “potato” stage. For me, my mental health is HEAVILY reliant on my physical health and confidence, and my health and confidence is reliant on my mental health. If one sucks, the other sucks too, and it’s a self pitying, deprecating, awful cycle that I actively try to break. 6 months ago, I went to the doctor and my A1C rose again, making me feel motivated to fix it. And For a while, we did good again! We went to the actual gym, ate well, tracted calories, did everything the internet told us to do, but slowly it happened again. We went to the gym less. “Another day” or “tomorrow” kept being said. I was left home alone or to my devices for dinner more often, and my lazy ass went for the “easy” stuff. Not what was good for me. And then, a little over a week ago. I got the news, that my A1C was 6.7. I was officially in diabetic territory. And I lost it. Sobbed, screamed at myself, threw things, cursed more than I have before. I’m not proud of my reaction, but most 18 year olds would have the same one. And we went to the doctor. Now, I’m on like- 3 medications to help manage it while I figure out how the fuck I lose my weight, how I reverse what I’d done to myself. I knew I had more risk than others because of my family history, with mom being at risk, and my moms family all having it, but it never really hit me until it well and truly got me, if that makes sense. I don’t know what to do. I try to have a positive mindset, but just looking down at myself ruins my mood. I try to exercise, but it’s hard to when you are surrounded by a mirror at the gym or at home, and I can see how much of a potato I look like. I genuinely have no part of myself I’m proud of. My rolls and stomach are disgusting to me, and I have no way of hiding them, my legs are filled with cellulite, my face is red and splotchy thanks to rosacea BC OF MY DIET ISSUES, my mind is mentally fucked over, and I can’t fix it because my mental health is tied to my physical health and confidence for me. I’m not trying to pity myself, I know what I did wrong. But if someone out there could give me advice on how you manage it, or anything to help, that’d be… great.

But without the genetic component it wouldn't matter. There are people out there living the exact same life without diabetes because their genes don't have diabetic markers. They will probably have other health concerns but not diabetes. Ask your doctor about a diabetes education class. I just did one, it was roughly 10 hours. We covered a lot. But the research is updated every year so continuing education is important. This is your health and you shouldn't be guessing. You need to know the risks and the consequences and your best chance at success. I get that you are mad about this. That is a natural reaction. It's honestly one of the stages of grief. I don't know what will get you to acceptance but you need to do that so you can figure everything out for yourself. Diabetes is different for everyone. There is no perfect plan that everyone can follow. You have to problem solve and figure out what works for you. The start of problem solving is gathering information. Test your blood sugar and figure out your baseline. There are three components to managing diabetes; diet, exercise, and medicine. If you take medicine, it doesn't make you a bad diabetic. It makes you a diabetic using medicine to help control your blood sugar. The general rule is 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. Walking is great. So is dance, bike riding, yoga, swimming, etc... You can do 30 minutes for 5 days a week or 50 minutes 3 days a week. I try to do 20 minutes 7 days a week. But I don't do it all at once. I do 5 + minutes 4 times a day. I was surprised it worked for me. It's easy to fit 5 minutes of walking at work but 10 to 20 minutes would be a distraction from my job. Also, drink 64 ounces of plain water every day. Limit your carbs. Like get your burger without the bun sort of stuff. Eat your veggies (non starchy veggies) first to slow down your digestion and eat carbs last. Most importantly, work with your doctor to figure out what works for you. You have to be deliberately healthy. And the best reason to do it is for yourself.

There are several risk factors, and we don’t have control over many of them. You’ll have diabetes for decades. Beating yourself up is just going to make it more difficult to manage. Try to let that go. Focus on taking care of yourself as best you are able. Take your meds. Keep up with your medical appointments. Try to eat healthier and get regular exercise and good sleep. See a dietician. A therapist might also be a good idea. Diabetes is manageable. You’ve got this.
