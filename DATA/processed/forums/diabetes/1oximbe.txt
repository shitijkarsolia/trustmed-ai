Hello! How do you manage the burnout of taking care of diabetes? I try to be on top of things as much as I can, but there is a slight burnout/exhaustion that comes. I think sometimes the burnout is about individual numbers being slightly higher. I do end up micromanaging. My A1C last checked was 7.6 which is still on the higher side but I'm trying my best to take better control of my diabetes. It is just tiring. Any tips would be helpful? Mentally/physically any suggestions. I do exercise daily and go to a therapist. Try to cut down carb intake. But since I'm on steroids, it gets tough sometimes.
