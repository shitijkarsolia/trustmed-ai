===============================================================================

Iv been doing the rather stupid of thing of...scouring google since I was informed I have stage retinopathy. The **ophthalmologist wasn't very ya know descriptive of what was gonna happen or helpful, really felt more like i was inconvenience in his office. But iv been..crying myself to sleep almost every night scared im gonna go blind, that i wont be able to game, read, watch tv, or talk to my online friends anymore. Every one keeps telling me i should be fine if keep a decent control on my blood sugar and A1c, Am i gonna..be semi ok or am i just...out of luck?**

The bleeds happen when the abnormal blood vessels burst, and they leak a chemical that causes more abnormal blood vessels. There is a treatment for this in the form of injections (scarier sounding than they actually are, but still try not to get to this point) For the blood vessels themselves, you can get laser surgery that will “burn out” the abnormal vessels and prevent more from growing. Either way, yes, try your best to keep your A1C under control. I know that it can often feel like “what’s the point”, but it really does help.

As long as I keep my blood sugars under control and go for regular eye exams, I am not worries about going blind.
