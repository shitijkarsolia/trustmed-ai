===============================================================================

30M 5'10" 180lbs. I drink pretty heavily and have for about 8 years. I am fully aware of my borderline obesity and my bad drinking habit. I do not smoke. I eat pretty clean and healthy. Drink PLENTY of water and take daily vitamins (multivitamin and about 4,000iu of Vitamin D). I've been sick with a sinus infection and sore throat for about 2 weeks now. The other day I noticed when I would blow my nose, I could smell ammonia. When I looked it up, all signs pointed to kidney issues. I stopped drinking and have had no withdrawal. My overall feeling, health wise, is usually decent. Nothing noticeable. I finally broke down and went to the doctor to get some antibiotics for my sinus infection. My blood pressure initially showed 180/140. They waited a few minutes and checked again and it was 161/121. I am aware this is no good... How far have I potentially damaged my body? Can I turn this ship around by changing my exercise, eating, and drinking habits? I really don't usually go for medical intervention, but I am curious if I am a ticking time bomb at this point.

2. u/abstractraj [score=3, created=2023-01-05T15:06:17]: If it’s blood pressure, you can definitely make improvements through diet, lifestyle, exercise, and medication. Hopefully, that’s all, but yes there’s a chance the HBP you’ve had may have started you towards health problems. Better to do what’s under your control and at least lessen the chance of more serious problems

5. u/redditaccount71987 [score=2, created=2023-01-13T07:24:56]: I'm not a drinker and have had arhythmias since youth. Can't hurt to check it out. Ask a PCP and they'll refer you to cardio if you're having issues.
6. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2023-03-09T12:18:03]: You should not be worried because you don't develop heart disease quickly. It's a very gradual process that happens over the course of many, many years in the walls of your arteries.
