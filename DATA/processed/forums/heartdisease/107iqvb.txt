===============================================================================

I've seen the charts and there is no denial. After every hospital visit I had in the past 40 days after my bypass, my hematocrit levels dove 6% on average each time due to several blood draws. Connecting the dots, this seems to cause me a lot of dizziness, not to mention, higher heart rate. My current hematocrit is at 33.5% (no, I don't normally have anemia) What is the best way to help it recover? I noticed it takes quite a while to do so.
