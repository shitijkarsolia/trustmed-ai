I feel like I have a cactus inside my chest when I breathe deeply and pressure in my chest like if I was underwater sometimes, I am somewhat anxious so maybe it's that

2. u/Racklefrack [score=1, created=2023-01-14T00:05:14]: Everyone presents differently if/when having a cardiac event, so there's no set of rules about how one feels. Mine present with a crushing burn in the center of my chest and also a radiating pain from my right shoulder tip to the back of my hand... but that's just me. I've never heard of a cardiac event feeling like a "cactus" but that doesn't mean it can't happen. The pressure you describe is more typical, but I believe acute anxiety can cause this as well. Simple deep breathing exercises might help relieve the pressure, and if it does you know it's probably not cardiac-related. Either way, a call to your doctor is probably warranted. Feel better.
3. u/DrJCPC [score=1, created=2023-01-14T05:50:23]: It depends on how long this has been happening – if just a week or two it could be due to a simple virus infection which will soon settle. If longer you need to have a check-up and maybe a chest X-ray or CT to make sure it's nothing serious. If you have already done this and nothing showed up, I would suggest a course of breathing exercises possibly supervised by a physiotherapist. Anxiety may contribute to the symptoms but is unlikely to be the only cause – the breathing training may well help with that as well. Unless the tightness comes on when walking uphill (and goes away when you stop) it's unlikely to be angina.
