===============================================================================

I have had a few EKGs. I recently read the interpretation of the first one, done in November 2021. It says "cannot rule out anterior infarct-age unknown". Why wouldn't my cardiologist tell me about that? No one has mentioned it to me. A later EKG (September 2022) says "possible pulmonary disease or pericardial effusion". That one was pre op work up for a craniotomy, so I understand that doc being focused on my tumor at that time, but still. I have asked my primary for a referral to a new cardiologist. An angiogram in 2021 mentions "mild CAD on cath". All my cardiologist said after the procedure was that I had some plaque and to eat better. CAD was never mentioned. I'm so frustrated. I have had mild chest pains on left side near center for years. The pain has been stronger for the past week and a half. I have been fatigued for years. I have been lightheaded for months. The past couple of days, my breathing has been deep/labored. Last night, my heart rate was close to 100bpm for hours, when resting. Something needs to be done soon.

2. u/melly_says_hi [score=1, created=2023-08-19T22:17:47]: Hmm 🤔 yeah, I'd start shopping for a new Cardiologist, if he's not taking the time to answer your questions etc. Unfortunately, I've witnessed docs who have poor communication skills with their patients and show lack of interest and I think it's horse shit. Plaque means coronary disease which should have been broken down for you, luckily it was mild according to his findings. But that doesn't mean it goes away and that it can't progress as I'm sure you know, of course. I strongly suggest you find one fairly soon if you do choose to get someone else. The increased chest pain and now the light-headedness is something that should be addressed and looked into to see if it has progressed or not.
