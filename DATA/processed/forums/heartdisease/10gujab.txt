===============================================================================

I would like to ask your opinion about this book. I have just started reading it and he starts off with a lot of self praise and wild claims about how useful this book can be (like self-help books from random gurus). So I would like to know if it's actually as good as it presents itself. Should I read on and take his advices seriously? I have 0 medical knowledge, so I can't really verify it myself.

It appears to have worked for him. I have done the diet for about a year as I have siblings that have had bypass surgery so I’m following it as a preemptive measure. I can say it’s helped. However, I have not been as strict with the diet as Esselstyn requires. That is changing now. I spent 15 hours in the ER with my wife and she’s been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. So, we plan to follow a more stringent approach now…why I joined the group today. I’m hoping to learn more from some shared experiences.

Her cardiologist just basically sent her home to die, she was told she had less than a year left. After implementing Dr Essys diet, she lived to be age 90 and died in 2016. From terminal heart disease to an extra 30 years. It doesn't get better than that.
