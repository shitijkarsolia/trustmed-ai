I did the echo where you get a ultrasound before treadmills and ultrasound after. I also had troponin done every 2hrs at a visit and ekgs done last 7-9 weeks. Everything was fine. I get home and get middle chest pain. Could it just be anxiety and I actually have bad anxiety. Thank you!!!

1. u/Racklefrack [score=2, created=2023-01-20T16:05:30]: Could it be anxiety, or perhaps something else like acid reflux or something similar? Absolutely, but just know that *none* of the tests you mentioned in your post definitively rule out coronary artery disease. In fact, they don't even come close to ruling it out. Age, diet, fitness, etc. all play a part. If you're young, exercise regularly, eat well, no family history of heart disease, sleep well, low stress, yadda yadda yadda, then your odds of it being coronary artery disease are pretty low and you'd do well to explore the options of treating anxiety, reflux, etc. first. However, if not, then pushing the doctors to perform more definitive tests to determine if it's coronary artery disease or not might be more prudent, *especially* if you do in fact have any family history of it at all. Good luck and feel better.

3. u/nithrean [score=1, created=2023-01-20T09:40:59]: Yes. It can easily be anxiety. It might not be, but it won't hurt to tackle anxiety and try to get it under control. Counseling is a good place to start. Also you might want to listen to something like the tell me about your pain podcast.
