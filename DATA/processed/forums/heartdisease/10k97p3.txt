2. u/hardtokill97 [score=2, created=2023-01-24T14:41:06]: Anything higher than 14 they will have a look into it. You're good, nothing to worry about 👍🏾
3. u/FlerisEcLAnItCHLONOw [score=1, created=2025-03-15T15:14:27]: This perspective is coming from someone who A.) spend Sunday through Friday with a sister who got three shiny new stints, 8 years after a quad bypass at 36, and 4 years after an entirely disabling stroke. And B.) personally had a triple bypass at 39, and have had many, many tests in the last six months, now at 43. And C.) was in the ER for chest pressure on Wednesday. On Wednesday my triponin was something like 8 or 9. The ER Drs said that during an active cardiac event that goes into the thousands or tens of thousands. My sister was discharged Friday with levels in the 4,000's after receiving the stints.(High levels are expected because of all the poking around in the heart). 5 or 6 is of zero concern. They also noted that new tests are "high sensitivity" and return values that were previously undetectable.

5. u/Responsible_Salt5663 [score=1, created=2023-02-18T08:47:03]: You know anything about why my troponin so low early then higher later? Two different hospitals
