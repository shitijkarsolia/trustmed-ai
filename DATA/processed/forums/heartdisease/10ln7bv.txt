===============================================================================

I apologise for the long post below . I am confused if I need to go on a lifelong dosage of statins. I am looking for advice from others who are in the same situation or medical professionals. Let me list down my thought process below - I'm an Indian male, 42 years old. Slightly overweight (5'9", 83 kgs). Over the last few years I have tried to lead a physically active lifestyle that includes at least 6-7 hours of exercise weekly, including cardio and weight training. My diet mostly comprises of home cooked Indian meals (rice, chappatis, pulses, legumes, and green veggies, with occasional chicken and eggs. I'm also a social drinker (1-2 drinks per week). I have a family history of heart disease (Both grandfathers, my father, and elder brother (49 years old) have had heart attacks). I get an annual blood work done and my LDL remains stubbornly high at about 100-120 even though I mostly eat healthy and workout. Triglycerides are below the threshold. Blood pressure is normal. I dont have any other risk factor like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, blood sugar and smoking etc. I consulted a physician recently after my brother got a heart attack. And he suggested that I immediately get on a daily regimen of statins (10mg). My biggest hesitancy about statins is that I dont want to take a drug for the rest of my life if there is no major risk for me. I feel any drug has its short term and long term side effects. For example, statins are known to cause Type 2 diabetes in some patients. I would like to stay away from any such unintended side effects. I'm sure there are others like me wrestling with this situation. It would be very helpful to hear your point of view and your experience with statins, if any. Thanks!

If you want to read the research behind that calculator go here: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a In particular, pay attention to section 4 where they talk about the risk/reward takeoffs. If you want an alternative view and an alternative assessment you can use the official risk estimator from the United Kingdom, here: https://qrisk.org/three/ Once you have done so I think you will see that the recommendation your physician gave you is in line with national recommendations and professional norms. **Second**, I suggest you follow someone on Twitter like @drlipid. https://twitter.com/Drlipid He does a excellent job of bringing the science behind this to the masses. https://twitter.com/Drlipid/status/1614669304053522433?cxt=HHwWgoCznavLuugsAAAA That tweet will help you better understand your lipid profile. **third** as regards to diet. A good diet cannot fix a problem that a bad diet didn't create. If the problems are familial/genetic then dietary interventions are going to at best have a limited impact.

Cut out sugar, meat, did a deep dive on my diet, and got my numbers to be good. Doctor changed it to 2mg nightly or 5mg every other day. He said mainly due to it being hereditary. He said no one ever changed that I must have been militant with my diet. If you can, show your doctor you can change, they might alter their initial recommendation.

It didn't work. In retrospect I wish I would have taken the statins. The recovery from the surgery is painful and now I am hyper aware of every chest discomfort, bout of palpitations and PVCs. I am constantly evaluating whether symptoms are real and merit a trip to the ED or more psychosomatic. It's not a good way to live. Also one word on diet. Post surgery I went completely vegan. It lasted about 3 years. Even though I am highly motivated, it is hard to follow a strict diet. I eat better than the overwhelming majority of Americans, but I still rely on 40mg of atorvastatin to keep the pipes clean. Best of luck with your decision. And trust yourself, you know your limitations and capabilities better than anyone else.
4. u/EMarieHasADHD [score=2, created=2023-02-03T03:28:19]: Stains have their use of course but also have negative effects. I would first try supplementing with garlic extract, plant sterols and omega 3s/fish oil or krill oil. These have been shown to lower cholesterol and improve heart health.
5. u/pasotours [score=2, created=2023-06-02T22:21:35]: Get your calcium scan done. It won't be covered by insurance but it is pretty cheap. I paid $200 and it is non-invasive and easy. I have bad history and was treating LCL-C to &lt;100. Had calcium scan though and showed very much prior plaque damage. Angiogram confirmed and i needed bypass. If you get a clean calcium scan you can have some reassurance you are good. But if it is high. You need to be way more aggressive with LDL IMO based on tons of research. I can send more links if you want.

7. u/FlerisEcLAnItCHLONOw [score=1, created=2025-05-27T09:10:59]: 43m I lost the genetic lottery. Significant family history of heart disease, and I had a triple bypass at 39. I've accepted that I'll be on statins for the rest of my life, setting aside some significant advancements in treatment. Along with the not insignificant list of other meds, I'm on 80mg of atorvastatin. I recently added CoQ10 and with that onboard I'm averaging about an hour of exercise 5 or 6 days a week. I've had basically every test you can think of in the past couple of months including stress test and catheterization and have received as clean bill of health as someone with a triple bypass can get.

9. u/abstractraj [score=1, created=2023-01-26T15:11:13]: Hello, Indian-American person here on statins. My cholesterol numbers were never even very high, but I ended up with coronary artery disease anyways. It does run in my family as it does in yours. I have no choice but to take statins if I want to extend my life. It may be the same situation for you. I did find some side effects on my initial statin, but luckily there are a number of statin options now and I feel perfectly fine on my current one. Long term I cannot say what will happen.
10. u/PittsJZ [score=1, created=2023-01-26T17:56:44]: Maybe get checked out by a cardiologist first? You might not need statins right now.
11. u/redditaccount71987 [score=1, created=2023-01-26T20:13:01]: You cant if your dr refuses to prescribe in office.
12. u/iJayZen [score=1, created=2023-08-27T09:10:24]: With your family history the doc probably wants your LDL under 70. Someone with no family history might be ok to not take meds yet.
