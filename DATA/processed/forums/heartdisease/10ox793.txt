===============================================================================

I had heart testing done from imaging to blood work too stress test. Everything is clean. I do have pvcs but this what just happened tonight...I'll starts from 2 days ago. Went to lay in bed. Gotten 1 pvc that made me lose my breath. Happens sometimes. This time it happen few times then out of nowhere 5 in a row maybe more. It was so intense that I gotten up and ran to get my phone. Called 911 and ended up in the ER all day doing blood work and troponin. Everything's fine. Today same thing but watching TV. Sweating a little bit not sure if it's anxiety or not. I called my cardiologist after hours. Some guy called me back and told me as if I will die and need to go to the ER. Issue is. Ice Strom and nothing I can do and the ambulance wouldn't even take me to the heart hospital. They just take you to the nearest one and mine nearest one is so so unprofessional. From 2 days ago to today 3 days. I still can workout with no issue so I'm not sure what's going on. Had stress echogram. X-ray November and troponin on January 21st and 25th. EKG 2 days ago and troponin.
