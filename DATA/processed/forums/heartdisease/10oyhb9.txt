Title: I’m a fit 43yo athlete diagnosed with heart disease. Put on 20mg crestor. Feel like I’ve lost significant tone and strength. Studies on statins involve a much older population. Wondering if anyone closer to my age has experience with power lifting/strength training on statins.

That drop LDL-C to &lt; 100 for me. I took for all this time with no side effects. Unfortunately, I wasn't aggressive enough or start early enough for my family history. I had an angiogram and was diagnosed with a widowmaker and needed bypass. That went well fortunately. I have now upped statin to max 80mg lipitor and LCL-C &lt; 70. Been 2 months post surgery and no side effects. I am in cardiac rehab with weight and cardio training and I am starting to feel better than pre-surgery fitness wise. Up to 100 watts 30 minute bike workout. For me, statins haven't been an issue. My genetics were.

I’m moderately fit- I run between 250 and 300 miles a year, but I don’t do strength training. I’ve never had any issues beyond what I felt east back pain initially that went away in a few months. I golf and ski with no Ill effects, other than I should always do more leg blasters. I think the research suggests you are better off with them than without them. How long have you been taking them?
4. u/Monemvasia [score=3, created=2024-08-24T12:59:39]: Crazy reading this. 57, 300+ calcium score; 40% blockage in left rear artery. Am on day two of statins (40mg) and aspirin. Backstory, Mediterranean diet most of life (super high HDL), run~ 100 miles/month, ride 400 miles (two 50” sessions day for commute) per month, swim, etc. In other words, feel super healthy. Was genuinely surprised that my doc was so concerned about the calcium test results. Needless to say, I am heeding her guidance/recommendation but damn it it sure makes you feel like you have a foot in the grave. Thanks for letting me add zero value to your post - but I am learning by reading these replies.

Look for Dr. Hannah Yoseph's books (google the image of the covers online first) and Dr. Duane Graveline's books. Read what happened to people taking the strongest one (Crestor) in his website spacedoc. Read what it is made of by researching its creator Akira Endo.

7. u/cryfreedmb [score=1, created=2023-03-18T17:40:45]: I'm on 10mg of crestor. No side effects. I'm around your age. Have you had a calcium score performed?
