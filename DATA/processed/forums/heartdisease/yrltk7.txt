===============================================================================

Hello everyone, concerned and anxious daughter here. I came here hoping to find some answers. My mother has been on medication for her heart for almost two years now. Unfortunately, I don't know what type of medication it is, or how exactly it helps her. I also do not know the name of them since she hides all of her medication from me in hopes that it doesn't worry me too much. Yesterday, I overheard a phone call of hers with someone in which she told them that she forgot to ask her doctor for a new prescription to be able to buy a new pack of the medication and that she only has one left for today. I have heard some people talk in the past that if you suddenly stop your heart-related medication, it can cause complications and might even be dangerous. Is that true? Afaik, she didn't buy any new ones today. Is it really that dangerous? Should I be worried? Edit: I apologise if this is a rather stupid question. Since I have no one to ask this question, I felt like this would be a safe space to do so! Thanks a lot to all of you!

Some drugs control the speed and rhythm of the heart rate, some drugs act like blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack, some affect the contractility of the heart muscle. If I were her, I'd get on the phone and get those meds ordered ASAP. She should not mess around with cardiac meds. Also, does she have early signs of dementia? My mother got quite secretive about a lot of things as she developed dementia related to cerebral vascular problems/small strokes.

3. u/Keggerbev [score=2, created=2022-11-10T15:15:07]: It can be of-course, we’re on medication for a reason. Common ones are blood thinners &amp; beta blockers, there are others and obviously depending on the medication would depend on the severity. For example blood thinners probably wouldn’t cause a sever reaction at all and probably wouldn’t notice any changes, but it isn’t good for you. Ask if she’s having any palpitations / dizziness and swollen ankles, all red flags. Ultimately just follow the drs instructions they know best.
4. u/LLCNYC [score=1, created=2022-11-10T15:50:23]: She should definitely call but nonetheless I take a boatload of heart meds and have forgotten here and there for a day over the years. For me, nothing happened.
5. u/iateyourbees [score=1, created=2022-11-10T15:57:39]: all she needs to do is call her doctor's office and tell them she needs a refill.
6. u/nothingleft2burn [score=1, created=2022-11-10T17:59:54]: It's pretty dangerous to stop blood pressure medication cold turkey. A statin - you could skip and be ok. Blood thinners, I imagine it would depend on the blood thinner. I've accidentally skipped a blood thinner once and I've been ok, but it really depends on the specific blood thinner and why you're taking it. One way or another she needs to get on top of this as soon as possible. And if it's a blood pressure medication she really shouldn't wait, like at all. Have her call her doctor now and explain the situation. They should be able to call in the script to her pharmacy and then she can pick it up. It's not a good idea to mess around with this stuff. Best of luck!

9. u/Shasari [score=1, created=2022-11-11T08:45:47]: I take Atenolol (50mg daily), a beta blocker for management of my ascending aortic aneurysm (currently 4.6cm). I have been told not to stop taking it. My research indicates if it were safe to stop taking it (for me, it’s not safe to stop), it would need a process of gradual reduction in the dose. The consequence of a hard stop with this medication is a spike in heart rate, heart muscle contraction force causing a spike in blood pressure, which for me could be fatal. TL/DR: it depends on which medication and what it is treating. Talk to your cardiologist or GP before making any changes to your medications on your own.
