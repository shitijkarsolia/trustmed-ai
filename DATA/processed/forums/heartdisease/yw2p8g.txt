===============================================================================

I've (25M) recently started taking an ADHD medication (Vyvanse) that has increased heart rate as a side effect. I've had moderately high blood pressure for a while now (130-135/80) and I'm losing weight and reducing my dietary sodium to address it. My pulse is around 70-75 BPM when sitting up at my desk and 62-67 BPM when laying down on the couch. I'm told that the increased HR will subside with time on the medication, but would it be positive if I laid on the couch instead of sat at my desk to take advantage of the lowered HR?
