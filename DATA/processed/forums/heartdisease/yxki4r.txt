Congenital heart disease, often known as a defect, refers to one or more structural issues with the heart that are present at birth. Children with a cardiac defect were born with it. Heart problems are frequently referred to as "congenital." A congenital heart defect develops when the heart or blood arteries near the heart do not develop normally before birth. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/snm8is600h0a1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b5421c0c9a3a40e74f6d1770dbd91262901c69

1. u/iateyourbees [score=2, created=2022-11-17T18:07:16]: IIRC, Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common congenital heart defect.
2. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2022-11-29T09:37:10]: I don't know if those are supposed to be the main ''umbrella categories'', but I think theres is a lot more of them. I was born with a coarctation of the aorta, which resulted in chronic hypertension. I had my first surgery at 18 months old, they removed the problematic part and reconnected the aorta... but it happened again (only about a 10% risk) and I had a balloon dilation at 24 months
