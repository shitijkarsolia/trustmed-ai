Hey everyone, don’t really have anyone to talk to so here I am. I’m 37 with a 60 percent blocked LAD this was found out about a year ago. I have a home blood pressure monitor that has been picking up PAD every so often. Laying also causes my face to feel numb or vibrate. Basically I feel as though it’s gotten allot worse. How would you follow up and see if there has been more progression? I’m on meds now beta blocker/cholesterol pill. Could they see the profession with a non invasive test? 70 percent is stent territory. I feel as though I’m there now.

Clinics are overrun in most parts of the world right now getting through the backlog of care neglected over covid and getting in could take time. Better to get yourself on the wait list now, than to wait for something bad to happen and then still have to wait to get help.

Progression could be seen in a stress test or by your symptoms getting worse.
