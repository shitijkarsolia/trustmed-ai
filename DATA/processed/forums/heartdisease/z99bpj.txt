===============================================================================

I have been recently diagnosed with unexplained hypertension and high heart rate. Cardiologist advised taking (bisonext 2.5tablet) once a day as far as my diastolic is above 90 or systolic is above 140. Do I need to have it daily ? I have been taking it only when measurement is above those values it is on and off and I read we should be regular and can’t skip a dose. The reason am not having daily is I live in USA 🇺🇸 and here doctor did not prescribe it and I have this diagnosed while in trio to India and I brought limited tablets with me and idea is to get an appointment with doctor in US before I run out of tablets. But also if I don’t need to use them as per US doctor he still need to prescribe me if i get started on them on regular basis. Am I doing the right thing ? Any advise ?

However I’m not a doctor so don’t take my word for it but isn’t a normal BP systolic supposed to be 100-120 and diastolic around 60?
