===============================================================================

I am falling apart at the moment emotionally and I would really appreciate some words of encouragement. I am 37M. I first started having health problems with sleep about 15 years ago which eventually resulted in a sleep apnea diagnosis. About 3 years ago, I had a bout with diverticulitis. Along with other strange symptoms I feel like have the body of a 60 year old and that I am rapidly aging beyond repair. I have dealt with what I thought was intermittent or largely anxiety induced high blood pressure for much of my adult life. I am going through a battery of cardiac tests due to some irregularities with some of my EKGs over the last few years. The results of my echo came in and my GP (haven't seen cardiologist yet) said I have a mild aortic root dilation. Obviously, I am extremely worried about this and I haven't even gotten the results from my holter monitor yet. I have an ambulatory bp monitor coming up in January and a stress test in February. I have told my wife and I am unsure how/if to tell my two young children. They keep asking me what's wrong because I am having a hard time keeping my emotions from bubbling up. I just can't stop thinking about the fact that I'm a ticking time bomb on multiple fronts and that I have to savour every moment now. I will likely need open heart surgery at some point for this and the chances of me seeing them grow up seem pretty slim. All of this is just a lot to bear. I am on meds for my blood pressure and I try to exercise daily but I now feel anxious to push myself at all. Anybody else have to deal with this at a similar age/life situation? Obviously with young children, you always wonder if they will be ok without you/how would they react to losing you, etc.

You owe that to your family. Work with your medical staff to identify these issues and solve them. Lastly, get your head straight. Use friends, family, professionals, exercise, healthy eating habits to establish a powerful foundation for whatever comes your way. You got this! 💪💪💪💪💪

In my case I had prexisting arythmias and cardiac obvious evidence of fluid in the cardiac lining leading to toenail hemorrhage expressed to a roomate while going delirious but she was more concerned about asking me how to evade the police and like how to improve urban areas by like planting flowers. In terms of loss there is nothing you can really do aside from talk to people. Right now I'm dealing with people trying to undiagnose disease rather than treat having started by screwing up and attempting to blame for asthma attack death, then rolled and stirred up people who were heroin addicts on the job in public, and then flew into denial about commiting act of torture and then repeatedly tried to tamper with medical devices, images, etc while screaming fake nonsense for the police. In terms of my family they will probably blame me for their sick baby and not tipping soon enough as a hostage and already tried to retract heritable medical from their own records having been contacted but not told that hashimotos is not bipolar. They also said no to needing psych at the beggining before being recontacted repeatedly.

NEVER TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. If your doctors don't have a solution that you're satisfied with, then don't stop there. Keep looking for an answer, keep trying new things, do not stop. I'm not sure what avenues you have tried to help manage your health, but a plant-based diet may be worth looking into.

When I was diagnosed I was at my peak in fitness, beating out all other ladies in my class at the beep test. Doctors told me they wouldn't put me on meds because I was too young and they lectured me to exercise and eat healthy, which was already a major part of my lifestyle. In my 30's my blood pressure shot up to over 250/112. The machine at the doctor's office could not read higher than 250, so I don't know how high it actually was. I was put on a cocktail of medication that I take 4 times a day. I feel like a shell of myself now. My medication causes confusion, memory loss, my reflexes are slower making it harder to drive. I have dark skin under my eyes, regardless of how much I sleep. I get cold in my extremities, sometimes it hurts. And most recently, the past week I have had non-stop indigestion in my upper stomach/esophagus area. Indigestion is a symptom of heart attack in some women, so it has me worried. I have similar feelings as you and in my mind I assume I will die in my 50's of heart failure, like so many of my family members before me. I'm doing my best to try to live what decent life I can for myself. It may seem morbid to some but it's what helps me cope with my eventual death. I have no idea what major thing I want to do with my life before I die, but I just don't want to suffer while I live.
