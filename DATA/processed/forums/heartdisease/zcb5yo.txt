It is a good indicator of your cardiovascular health and it's also a healthy sign if it's within the normal range. Resting heart rate between 80-90 bpm is normal. If your heart rate is over 90 bpm, you need to cool it down by taking some exercises. For example, going to the gym and jogging on a treadmill or purchasing a rowing machine and rowing every day for 20 minutes on medium intensity. If you exercise in a gym, make sure you also do weight training or do some other work-out that increases your heart rate. If you don't exercise much, start off with mild exercises. When your resting heart rate goes down to 90 bpm, you can increase the intensity. More details: [https://gktiyer.com/](https://gktiyer.com/)

Lower is often better: While 80-90 bpm is "normal," a lower resting heart rate often indicates better cardiovascular fitness and more efficient heart function.. What's normal can vary from person to person due to factors like age, gender, fitness level, stress, anxiety, medications, caffeine intake, smoking, and certain medical conditions. It's often more informative to track your own resting heart rate over time rather than comparing it to others.
