So you have a few things: 1: Lifestyle changes to ensure no new plaques form. 2: Talk to your doctor about getting an angiogram done. That will show the extent of plaques and what you need to do.
3. u/StalkedUp_4_Life [score=3, created=2022-12-06T13:00:14]: There is not any drug available that can reverse it, however there is a good deal of research that is pointing to the stabilization and even reversal of CAD by switching to a plant based whole food diet. It is quite compelling, look up Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. Ornish, or even PBWFD for CAD reversal and you will find tons of information. It works by eliminating inflammation in the body so hypertension and many other conditions will improve as well.
4. u/courthouseman [score=2, created=2022-12-06T03:10:34]: Some of the cardio drugs that they can give you help a lot in slowing down your heart (a tiny bit) and extending the length of each heartbeat (by a tiny bit as well). I'm 53 and was diagnosed with early stage congestive heart failure when I was 49. All the long-term medications I started taking when this occurred have halted progression of it; my heart is running a little less than optimal as far as ejection fracture but has remained steady for the last 3 years. I'm on several medications. A few of them actually serve to slow down your resting heart rate (a small bit) and also to extend (by literally milliseconds) the length of each heartbeat, which on the surface wouldn't seem to be significant but it really is, in the long term.

Only getting your LDL below 50 has shown to stop and slowly reverse atherosclerosis. High intensity statin. Research! Cleveland Clinic docs.
