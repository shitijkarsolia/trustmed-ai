Hello everyone, We are doing a study at Baylor University and it aims to determine the relationship of comorbid cardiometabolic diseases and the absence of a father while growing up. We are asking you to participate in this study because you may fit the recruitment inclusion criteria for the study. If you choose to be in the study, you will be asked to fill out an online-based survey regarding exercise, nutrition, and fatherlessness. \- This is a one-time survey. \- The survey consists of 58 questions. It will take approximately 7 minutes to complete. \- All your information will remain confidential, and your identification of information will be de-identified. &amp;#x200B; **Risks and Benefits:** To the best of our knowledge, there are no physical risks to you for taking part in this study. You may be uncomfortable with some of the questions and topics we will ask you. There are no direct benefits to you from taking part in this research. However, others may benefit in the future from the information that is learned in this study. Possible future benefits include increased knowledge gained from the research results may help decipher potential correlations between fatherlessness and the development of comorbid cardiometabolic diseases. &amp;#x200B; **Confidentiality:** The risk of taking part in this study is the possibility of a loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality includes having your personal information shared with someone who is not on the study team and was not supposed to see or know about your information. The researcher plans to protect your confidentiality. Confidentiality will be maintained to the degree permitted by the technology used. Your participation in this online survey involves risks similar to a person's everyday use of the Internet, including illegal interception of the data by another party. If you are concerned about your data security, you should not participate in this research. We will keep the records of this study confidential by keeping completed surveys on a password protected Qualtrics server. The data will then be transferred to a password-protected computer in the principal investigator's locked office. We will make every effort to keep your records confidential. However, there are times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of your records. The authorized staff of Baylor University may review the study records for purposes such as quality control or safety. &amp;#x200B; The link for the survey can be found here: [https://baylor.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_7THmzSpDChWEPNY](https://baylor.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7THmzSpDChWEPNY)
