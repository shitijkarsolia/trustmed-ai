===============================================================================

My lifestyle is pretty shitty, I drink at least 4 beers every night I scream at my video games, I don't do any exercise or even leave my room to be honest. This past week my heart has been acting really weird, everytime I try and go to sleep my heart won't slow down and just last night I got really dizzy and sweaty and thought I was gonna pass out. Also anytime I'm on the verge of sleep my body will shoot me awake and I've been getting very weird dreams. Anyone know what it might be? Thanks.

Now, if you have any history of heart diseases in your family, that makes you extra vulnerable to those elements.
