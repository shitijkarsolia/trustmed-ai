===============================================================================

Has anyone here experienced a sharp chest pain that feels like it goes down to the stomach? If I were to describe it, it would feel like a straight line at the edge of my left pec near the center of my chest, starting in the middle of the pec and feels like a sharp stinging pain that goes straight down in almost into my belly. I only feel it in this one area, and it comes and goes. Would rate the pain level maybe 2-3 out of 10

Can you check your heart rate, blood pressure, and/or O2 count during these moments of pain? Keep a small log/journal in case your doctor needs this info
