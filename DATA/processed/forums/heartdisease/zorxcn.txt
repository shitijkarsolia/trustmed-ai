===============================================================================

Let me preface this by explaining what I’ve been going through for the past ~2 months or so Back in early October I was visiting my boyfriend in Michigan and since it’s a state where weed is legal we decided to give some a try. I hadn’t done it since college so it had been a few years, and I’m assuming I just did too much too fast because it triggered a panic attack. Ambulance was called and they told me I just needed to go back inside and relax so that’s what I did. The panic attack eventually subsided and everything was all good. However, that panic attack absolutely scared the FUCK out of me and during it I legitimately thought I was going to die because I had never experienced anything like that before. Ever since then I’ve had extreme health anxiety relating to my heart and I’m overly aware of almost every beat, constantly freaking about whether or not I’m having a heart attack or some other episode. This has led me to get multiple EKGs, all of which turned up completely normal. This wasn’t enough to convince me however, so my PCP set up an appointment with a cardiologist to have an echo done. Fast forward to this past Friday, I visit the cardiologist and they start me off by putting a 24 hour Holter on me before the echo. So I put the Holter on, wait a day, and come back for the echo. After the echo I am told my heart is structurally perfect (which is GREAT news for my anxious mind) however they tell me my heart rate spiked multiple times that night with the Holter on, all while I was asleep. The cardiologist suspects this is SVT and prescribed beta blockers which I started taking tonight. The reason why I’m skeptical is because of it was SVT wouldn’t I also be having episodes while I’m awake? I have never had any episodes of a spiked heart rate since the panic attack so this comes as such a shock to me. Is it possible that I am just so stressed about my health that I am just having anxiety attacks in my sleep instead of it being SVT? Or is there a possibility of it being something else?

2. u/glamapanda69 [score=1, created=2022-12-18T10:08:45]: How high the the HR during the arrhythmia? I recently had an ablation to cure my SVT so know the condition like the back of my hand.
3. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2022-12-18T17:18:08]: I had SVT which triggered after taking up road bike cycling. Happened during high intensity excercises, heart rate went upto 232 bpm while my normal max was about 194 bpm. Each episode ranging from 30 seconds and upto 5 minutes. The way it felt was one powerful beat followed by the rising heart rate and strangeness in the chest. My doctor told me if it would happen I should stop, close my eyes and try to calm down while rubbing two fingers on the left side on my neck (calmimg procedure?) However I rememberrd episodes of strange feeling in my chest as far as 10 years before diagnosis. (few occurrences). I had to go for 3 heart ablations over two year period as there were multiple nerves causing electrical irregularities in my heart. Listen to your doctors and if you stop taking beta blockers then at least get a chest heartrate strap which records data, it was really useful for me to get a proof of what was happenkng for the doctors. You can wear the chest strap comfortably during sleep (unless you sleep on your stomach). I used one from company called 4iiii: https://shop.4iiii.com/collections/heart-rate-monitors
