===============================================================================

Anyone else experience a spasm on upper left side of chest. Feels like a pause or like it sinks in. Now i felt it on my whole chest. At first i thought it was an esophagal spasm, but now its an every day thing constantly. It has been happening for a week and a half now. I dont have an appointment till Feb 13 w cardiologist. Any remedies u all recommend or diet

I think the best advice is probably to call into the Dr office and talk to someone about it. Sometimes in those situations you move to a higher priority and can get in earlier.
