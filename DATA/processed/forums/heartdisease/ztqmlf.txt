===============================================================================

Am suffering from hypertension and i recently started beta blockers as prescribed by doctor. Despite of medication the BP hasn’t come down yet and he prescribed Aldosterone Renin Ratio test which came up 19.2. In his notes he mentioned it is abnormal and referred to an endocrinologist. But as per my lab website ARR is normal up to 23. How to understand my condition and test result. Doctor advised to increase dosage of atenolol from 25mg per day to 50 mg per day
