===============================================================================

Hello everyone, I’m a man, 29 years old. 170 cm, 55 kg. I have a chronic kidney disease (glomerulonephritis, stage 3). I control my blood pressure with Perindopril. Have never been overweight, but I’m not fit at all either. In March 2021 I had a terrible headache, chest pain, higher blood pressure than usual and difficulty focusing my eyesight (I couldn’t read). This episode lasted for a couple days, and ever since it went away, I had these symptoms: * Constant chest tightness and chest discomfort, primarily on the left side. It feels like something is squeezing my chest. * Constant shortness of breath and inability to take a satisfying breath. Feeling that something in the chest doesn’t open up and air doesn’t reach where it is supposed to go. Breathing feels shallow. I cannot even breathe in enough air to talk and get out of breath all the time when speaking. * Very frequent, almost constant, chest pain. The pain is usually right under my left breast, where I can feel the heartbeat. It feels like intense squeezing or pressure. I wake up with this pain in the morning quite often and have it for days. I can’t seem to pinpoint what triggers it. * Palpitations, not very frequent * Strong heartbeat, feeling of pulsation in the body * Dizziness, brain fog, tiredness I experience chest tightness and difficulty breathing literally **all the time**, they never subside. I tried daily jogging during the summer and the autumn, and the pain doesn’t necessarily come during or right after training (although that can happen too). I don’t know if there is a direct connection between the pain and physical exertion. At this point I have done these tests, some of them multiple times: * Blood and urine test: don’t show anything except for my kidney disease * Spirometry: shows reduction in lungs volume. Asthma medicines give no improvements. * Chest X-rays: everything is ok * Electrocardiography: everything is ok * Echocardiogram: everything is ok * Heart CT scan: showed a slight incipient atherosclerosis in left anterior descending artery, but my doctor says it shouldn’t give symptoms like these. * Gastroscopy: esophagus is fine. * Threadmill: according to the doctor, the test shows that everything is ok, but I get tired and out of breath during running very quickly. I have used three different asthma inhalers for half a year without any effect. I get heartburn quite often, and medicines against that help, but they don’t improve shortness of breath or chest pain at all. After CT scan detected slight atherosclerosis, I started taking Atorvastatin. I don’t hyperventilate. I breathe at a normal rate, but the feeling of air hunger is always there. Sometimes I intentionally take a deeper breath. It can be successful and air hunger subsides for a moment, or it feels like my chest doesn’t increase in volume after specific point and I don’t get a satisfying breath. Oximeter shows normal oxygen saturation of the blood (even during jogging). Some doctors I’ve encountered suggest that this is psychological issue, but I don’t think so because a) I’ve never experienced any panic attacks or similar before, b) it doesn’t explain the starting episode and c) it doesn’t feel connected to my psychological state. I am vaccinated against corona. All in all, doctors claim my heart is ok, but I am not sure about it. Asthma inhalers don’t help. Majority of the symptoms are there 24/7, without changing much for better or worse during more than a year. I have been to ER a bunch of times, and my doctors have no idea what this could be. Is anyone here been in a similar situation? What can I do? This feels like this is a heart issue, but I don’t know. Shouldn’t CT rule it out? Can it happen that CT doesn’t pick up any conditions, bur MRI does it? Should I insist on getting MRI? Are there other tests I should do?

I had a nasty viral infection probably from March through July of 2019. Not COVID-19, as this was 1 year before COVID-19 hit the U.S. I went to the doctor several times and one time they did some sort of viral assay and said "well, not the flu, but its viral" type of answer. It was a respiratory infection with horrible coughing, and just about everything else you can imagine that goes with a respiratory infection. In July 2019 it cleared up. And then about mid-August 2019 I started getting symptoms of "puffiness" and my chest started, very slowly, getting a bit tighter and tighter. No pain though. After about 3-4 weeks of this, I went to a hospital and stayed overnight. The viral illness that I had was causing some type of quickly progressing congestive heart failure and I was experiencing a high level of water retention in my body (leg was starting to poof up a bit). A diuretic cleared that up right away. I was released the next day although they couldn't figure out why my standing heart rate was about 120 bpm. They did a cath procedure within a few days and they couldn't see or visualize anything that was blocked. They did lots of other tests as well. My ejection fraction from my left ventricle was low, like 20%, so they knew I had some type of congestive heart failure. They put me on several meds that were switched around a few times over the next couple of months. I don't want to say I'm "cured" but the meds saved my life - stabilized me, and improved my heart function somewhat. I haven't need a pacemaker (there's a certain type of pacemaker that is usually recommended for people that have a low ejection fracture). The meds I'm on now have mostly stayed the same since the beginning of 2020. Right now, my ejection fracture has stabilized at 35-40%. Not the best, but I get tested about every 6-12 months and its been good for 3 years at this level. I don't have tightness, or having a feeling of being winded. I haven't gotten back to my usual exercise regimen, but I can go on fast walks and easy/moderate hikes and feel fine.

At worst you will be in the same spot but it might help a lot. Most of these questions are things for your doctors though.
