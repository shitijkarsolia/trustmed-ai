===============================================================================

I've been having this issue for so many years and it's slowly gets worse. Whenever I drink small amounts coffee I have discomfort around my chest. When I eat just a bit of chocolates I get chest discomfort. Getting into a small argument or if I get really upset I get chest discomfort. Eating small portions of fried foods makes my heart feel uncomfortable. When I was playing basketball and going back-and-forth on the court my heart was pounding and I was running out of breath. I'm physically in-shape, I exercise 3 - 5 times a day, I eat a lot of fruits (not a lot of veggies tho). I take omega-3s, vitamin complex, drink lots of water, and etc... No, I don't drink coffee everyday and the same goes for sweets. Do I have high cholesterol? Are my arteries clogged? Is my heart weak and damaged from prolonged stress and depression? There are moments where I feel out of breath, I can't enjoy food, or sleep because of my heart/chest pain. I'm 27 y/o and average around 165 lbs. What do I do? Can somebody please help me?

That's why it is important to see a specialist; you need to make sure you're getting accurate information to move forward. You got this, but the next step is seeing a cardiologist.
