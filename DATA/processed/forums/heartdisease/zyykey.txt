[**Primary Angioplasty**](https://www.sriramakrishnahospital.com/majordepartment/cardiology/) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat heart attacks. It involves opening the blocked artery and restoring blood flow to the heart. The procedure is performed by threading a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin and up to the heart. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/gslm21gzv09a1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5a4079620594301ab800f435895edda255c702f

1. u/tomtomfreedom [score=1, created=2022-12-30T07:21:47]: Hi can anyone tell me what is my next step? I have off and on chest discomfort and pain. It is NOT muscular or anxiety.. recently had cardiac ultrasound that was normal (wasn't having symptoms at the time other then low BP.) What test should I ask for next? I'm slender, male 145 Lbs, non smoker. Strong family history of heart disease but doctors don't seem to believe my symptoms. I need to request the tests. Thank you

I thought it was mainly looking for blood flow....and check this out: my uncle passed all his tests with no problems as his blood flow was good enough from what inunderstand. Then he was having serious chest pains and went to the emergency room amd he was 98% blocked. Why didn't the tests pick this up before hand? Was it becaseu his blood flow was adequate enough when he got tested? This concerns me.
