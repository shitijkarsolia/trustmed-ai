===============================================================================

After my bypass surgery I discovered a dozen things that will stop me from sleeping, layered one under the other like an onion skin. I thought it would help me get some relief if I finally get that surgical tape removed in a month, and I waited patiently for that moment, only to realize that once that tape was removed, it revealed a strip of blisters underneath, that I'm dying to scratch but I can't. It got worse than better. I can't even wear an undershirt (or any shirt) anymore, I can't put anything on it without feeling like I have to crawl out of my skin. How long will this new torture last? I've only been sleep deprived for a month.

Most of these reactions start improving within 1–2 weeks after the tape and any adhesive residue are fully removed, though mild redness or sensitivity may linger for several more weeks. In the worst cases, where blisters form like yours, full skin recovery often takes 10 days to 2 weeks, especially if you ease it with gentle care . Some users report tingling or discoloration (hyperpigmentation) lasting a few months before fading .

I used to be fine with all adhesives until a doc put a tape near my groin area and now all adhesives on my skin cause redness and irritation. I can see where a bandaid was weeks after I take it off if don’t put cortisone on it. Lol
