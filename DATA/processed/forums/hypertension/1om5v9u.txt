===============================================================================

My BP was 150/90s and then I lost 50 something lbs and still losing. I don’t do ANY caffeine. I eat extremely clean, never packaged foods because of allergies. I lowered my salt, take potassium, magnesium, l theanine, vitamin Bs. Blood pressure when down to 130/70-80s. My thyroid medication never went down and I was at a high dose. Got palpitations and no was super high 160/90s. Endo lowered my dose, 5 days ago. My BP reading a bit ago was 150/90. Back to what it was awhile back. No more palpitations so far but, my other doc wanted me to go on Valsartan. I want to wait and try to see if it will go down again. Should I wait and see or go on it and then taper off later on?

Measure your BP at the morning, when you wake up before you take any medication, eat anything and empty your bladder. Measure it as follows: Sit down, be comfortable, like relax your shoulders, your stomach, everything. Not "feeling like dead" relaxed, just relax. 5 minutes later measure, if it's high, try again after 2 mins and if it's more than 10 points in difference (up or down) try for the third time. Also maybe try betroot juice, coconut water but in controled doses (2 deciliters per day, more is too much!). I am on 133/71 average with 60 resting HR. I am doing DASH diet for 2 weeks now. I was in the 140/80 last week. So that helps :)
