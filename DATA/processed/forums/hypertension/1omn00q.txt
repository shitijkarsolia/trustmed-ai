===============================================================================

I've had hbp for years, treated with amlodipine, in may I had a heart attack, relatively small one thankfully, they put me on ramipril and bisoprolol as well as a statin, when I measured my BP in August,( I didn't record the later ones,) it was 111/75, when I measured it today it started at 130/88, but went down to 125/85, should I mention this to the doctor,or is it still okay. I do need to lose weight I'm 98 kg, 5'10 but exercise is a problem as I have angina.

Have you relaxed long enough to calm your body? Did you have your feet on the floor flat? Etc. I don’t let the one elevated reading bother me to much but with your heart attack it’s wouldn’t hurt to let your doctor know especially if the elevated readings continue.

I stopped monitoring bp during the spring and summer, but started again after it was high last doctors visit. I am averaging 129/85
