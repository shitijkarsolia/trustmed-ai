===============================================================================

So I took the opportunity at my annual review to say I wasn't completely happy with readings on Ramipril 5mg as getting 140/90. Not disastrous but I've done everything possible to lower manually and these levels were same as before medication. I had all clear ECG, excellent bloods bar one reading. So nurse put me on 36 hour BP watch to rule out white coat and average was slightly higher. So he upped me to 7.5 for 2 weeks. Post 2 weeks of 50% and no difference on readings, in fact pulse dropped to 42 from usual 45-48 average. (I am quite fit but not sure I'm that fit!!) So referred back to Docs and he put me on double to 10mg Ramipril for a month and booked bloods in 2 weeks to ensure ok, and echo on heart (that's later today). Been on these 7 days now and my BP is now 150/105 so what on Earth is going on. Feel like reverse is happening! Will update post echo later. EDIT: Echo went ok. Obviously they couldn't commit as they need to officially measure and write a report but he mentioned off the record nothing to worry about. Thanks for all the replies, think I will suggest a change of medicine to see if that is an option.

2. u/DaleAlanC [score=1, created=2025-11-03T06:17:25]: Takes a month for them to work at peak efficiency but not all bp meds are compatible with everyone. If still no decrease it could be worth switching to an ARB like Telmisartan instead of an ACE like Ramipril to see what works best for you. Unfortunately BP medication isn’t an exact science and can involve a bit of trial and error to find out what’s best for the individual. Fingers crossed for you.

Removed it and BP dropped back and side effects vanished in days. No idea why. Shouldn’t be possible. Apparently.
4. u/phild1979 [score=1, created=2025-11-03T08:38:08]: From my experience with ramipril it wasn't great but also took near the full 6 weeks to have any impact. Amlodipine worked better with different side effects, indapamide was the best one but it's a nightmare to come off!
