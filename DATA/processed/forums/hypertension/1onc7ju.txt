In the meantime, they invented blood pressure medication. Lifestyle changes aren’t enough for everyone—my dad had high blood pressure when he was a skinny draftee. “Natural” can kill you. If meds are right for you, take them!

2. u/lbyrne74 [score=4, created=2025-11-03T12:11:00]: Totally agree. Genetic predisposition plays a big part in medical conditions. I mean that doesn't give us licence to play with fire and be deliberately unhealthy, but we can all name examples of people who did all the "right" things being afflicted with poor health, and at the other end of scale, people who you'd think wouldn't live long because of how they neglect themselves, living till an old age.
3. u/RadarSmith [score=2, created=2025-11-03T10:37:43]: Agreed. Even when taken care of, the human body is far from perfect and often benefits from some help from medication. That said, the medications work a lot better *alongside* lifestyle changes.
4. u/Level-Program-5489 [score=2, created=2025-11-03T12:24:39]: what are the side effects of meds? My blood pressure is routinely 140/80. but if i stop taking my ADHD meds it goes down to like 130/70.
