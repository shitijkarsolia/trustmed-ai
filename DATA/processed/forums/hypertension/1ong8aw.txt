===============================================================================

Backstory: My husband had a stroke in 2021. His blood pressure during the stroke was extremely high, obviously. He was put on Amlodapine and baby aspirin. Well,about a year ago, his (new) doctor took him off the Amlodapine. For a while, his BP was stable. However, last week, his BP spiked while at work. They sent him home. I was late for work that day and, as soon as I heard what his BP was, I rushed him to the ER. He maxed out at 210/133 and docs couldn't get it down. Turns out, he has resistant hypertension. MRI showed two additional minor strokes that could have been much worse. He's now on 5 BP meds and a low sodium diet. The Question: The problem is, he eats like a picky toddler. I can list the vegetables he will eat and he LIVED for processed foods (think frozen meals and food, boxed side dishes, etc.) and fast food. Trust me, I know it's immature, but if he even THINKS that I put a vegetable in his food -- or if a vegetable touched his food during the cooking process -- he will claim he can taste it and he won't eat it. He loves Italian food and meat/potatoes. So, I need some recipes that I can make that ARE NOT BLAND, but also don't include a lot of stuff that he just won't eat. Below is a list of what he WILL eat: Vegetables: Iceberg lettuce Cucumber Mushrooms Potatoes Green Beans Corn Meat: Chicken Ground Beef Steak Tuna Fish (RARELY EATS) Hot Dogs (can't eat now) Kielbasa (can't eat now) Sausage (can't eat now) Ham (can't eat now) Dairy: Milk Cheddar, Mozzarella, Parmesan cheese Cottage Cheese (RARELY EATS) Ricotta Cheese Carbs: Pasta (and NOT whole wheat, veggie, or protein pasta) White Bread Potato Bread Rolls (hamburger, hot dog, Kaiser rolls) Crescent rolls If you have to get a little sneaky with vegetables in your recipes, that's okay! I just want him to get healthy! BONUS: Thanksgiving recipes would be great too? Our normal spread consists of candied ham (he won't eat turkey), Parmesan garlic mashed potatoes, Italian style green beans (fresh green beans marinated in Italian dressing), homemade macaroni and cheese, stuffing (he won't eat), and crescent rolls. Any HEALTHY substitution recipes would be AMAZING!!!!

Meat - Turkey, Chicken, Tuna or any other fish. Beef should be limited. Carbs: Whole wheat pasta, brown rice (no sweets or anything with white flour). Maybe look into DASH diet. Try it for a month (it usually takes at least 2-3 weeks to work) and build on that. I also crave food like your husband but I had a stroke level blood pressure which I lowered with exercise, medication and now DASH diet. I have cheat meals from time to time but otherwise am at least 75% in line of it.

3. u/bobsatraveler [score=1, created=2025-11-07T15:11:10]: I think the hard reality is that when you go low sodium you have to tolerate a period of adjustment. If you get through that, things actually taste better. When we did it I got a lot of spice mixes from Pensey's online. They are good about identifying their low and no-sodium products. Also I recommend Trader Joe's coffee rub if you have a store nearby. It's low sodium and does a good job with meats on the grill. Just my personal thoughts - you have more chance of success if you approach this gradually. Going cold turkey might be more likely to lead to failure. For example, I don't worry about the occasional dinner out or holiday. I still try to make good choices, but too much denial can backfire. Good luck. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!
