UPDATE -Thanks for helping me to not panic. I guess I was just shocked by the swollen ankles which I never had before! I noticed my ankles were swollen a bit ...Never happened before. Have been on 5mg amlodipine for years. (Years ago my bp was mildly elevated..140 over ? so doc put me on amlodipine. I read about swollen ankles and remembered I had been taking the same tiny 5mg pills in the morning and evening for weeks. (Put them in the wrong slots in pillbox!) So I stopped the salt, drank more water, elevated my legs, and didn't take any amlodopine yesterday. BP was 102/60 and 98/55. This morning I went back to my 5mg pill, drank water and elevated legs again. Ankles less swollen. Today's bp was 114/70 730 am 109/66 at 336 pm. Called doc for appointment, but in the meantime wondering if these figures warrant an Urgent Care visit. (I have no other medical problems) Input appreciated.

If so once you resume your normal 5mg the issue will solve itself. Your post is a bit all over the place can you clarify the actual issue?
2. u/edumedibw [score=5, created=2025-11-03T15:48:43]: If you’re asymptomatic don’t worry. 10 is a normal dose
3. u/Clairefun [score=7, created=2025-11-03T14:44:08]: Bp consistently under 90/60 is officially classed as low, but it's not a big issue unless its long term or you're getting faint or dizzy from it. Just go back to your correct dose of amlodipine and it'll come back up some. Nothing to worry about.
4. u/Joanrtr [score=3, created=2025-11-03T15:52:29]: Amlodipine’s washout time period is rather long at 11 days. So it also takes a while to build up. I’d give it the same 11 days. So it’s a bit hard to judge the effect of a change in medication for amlodipine. I understand walking helps reduce swollen ankles, but I have no experience with that. I’m on amlodipine 2.5 once a day and don’t have swollen ankles. I just lowered my dose from 5 to 2.5. You might be able to lower yours some, because your readings are low to normal.

6. u/VitoVino [score=1, created=2025-11-03T16:33:56]: I took double dose of amlodipine a few times and yeah my BP was down, no swelling, but I felt like crap and had a bad headache.
7. u/Silent-Sprinkles-448 [score=0, created=2025-11-03T18:14:22]: Nope. Go back to your 5 mg. and take L citruline which is an amino acid supplement. I’m not a doctor, just sharing my routine.
