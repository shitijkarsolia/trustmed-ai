===============================================================================

BP and weight keeps moving in the right direction. **Sleep:** 7 h 14 m **Steps:** 9,617 **Healthy Foods:** - Eggs, avocado, chickpeas - Cauliflower - Green pepper, onion, tomato, ginger, garlic - Moringa tea, kefir - Blueberries, raspberries, pomegranate Started the day with avocado toast and an omelette. Cravings were strong, but I skipped dinner for the first time. My last meal was at 3 PM. I’m thinking of keeping that routine going every day and turning it into a habit.

Could help one issue while creating another such as diabetes. The dietitian helped me a lot with how I was eating. 2 months and down 30 lbs by simple changes to how I was eating and walking for about 30-40 minutes a day. Highly recommend one for anyone trying to lose weight for hypertension or lose weight in general.
