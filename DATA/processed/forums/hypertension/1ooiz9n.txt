===============================================================================

33 y/o Male, 6’1-190 LBs So last year during my deployment my doc alarmed to me that my blood pressure was super high (140-145 sys). I had already known this since about 2020 but never took it seriously honestly (i wrote it off as stress in the Army and me drinking a lot etc). He then put me on medication.. Fast foward.. I have been on FOUR different meds. At first I was on Hydro (something, it caused cramping and would deplete me of electrolytes), Then I was on Lysinopril, (caused stomach issues and something else I don’t even wanna mention on a public platform (males watch out for this one), then I was on Losarton, no side effects but didn’t lower my blood pressure enough, Now my doc has prescribed me Telmisarton/amlopine). And I woke up this morning to pee dizzy as all hell. Mind you guys, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I have a resting heart rate of 50. I’m active duty military so I run like 6-7 miles a week, I also hit the weights and train MMA. I’m also fairly lean. My blood pressure still averages 140/145(+\-) everyday and its mentally draining. I eat meal prepped whole foods mostly during the week. (Yes I eat out on the weekends but thats it and may have a small salty snack during the week but that’s it). Is anybody else in this boat where they have had to try multiple meds and still not working?? Has anyone had success with natural remedies??

A significant percentage of the population has such numbers for years, though they come with in increased long term risk. You won't stroke out at these numbers. Did you get checked for sleep apnea? It can definitly lead to resistant higher BP.

Even at my fittest and leanest, living off huel and home prepped low salt / fat foods and training 6 days a week i never cracked it. No booze, no nicotine, no caffeine. Latterly a scan found a duplex kidney so maybe now getting closer to answers… its not always lifestyle I’ve sat at 135-140 / 92-99 for several years now on max meds i can tolerate. Looking into kidney ablation
3. u/neanderbeast [score=3, created=2025-11-05T11:33:59]: Have you seen an endocrinologist? I have uncontrollable blood pressure and they think I have something called conn's syndrome, a problem with the adrenal glands.

5. u/Alarmed-Original9597 [score=2, created=2025-11-04T15:37:07]: Could be anxiety/stress. BP meds should bring it down. I agree with losartan being rubbish. Its such a short acting drug i dont know why they prescribe it. Im on 2mg of candersartan which is brilliant with no side effects. It reduced my BP from 180/110 to 120/80
6. u/Direct_Lemon_867 [score=2, created=2025-11-04T16:34:31]: When you say electrolyte issues, did the hydrochlorathiazide tank your potassium levels? I wouldn’t categorize your numbers as super high, but if that med caused significant potassium loss and since losartan wasn’t effective, both are hints that you could have primary aldosteronism, a secondary cause of hypertension. If your doctor hasn’t already, it would be worth screening for it.
7. u/Affectionate_Bug9291 [score=2, created=2025-11-04T22:07:36]: Check for secondary HTN. This is when high blood pressure is caused by some other body system like your kidneys, thyroid etc. I’d say ask your dr to do more tests to rule out other reasons your blood pressure is high. This also sounds like resistant HTN which is when 3 or more meds just aren’t helping and you need to get to the bottom of why.
8. u/Joanrtr [score=2, created=2025-11-04T23:29:39]: First, it’s probably Telmisartan causing dizziness. I had tried several drugs singly and in combination with another. It took 3 drugs to control my BP, but it didn’t take a large dose of any of them. I am on lisinopril 10, amlodipine 5, and HCTZ 6.5. At these levels, I don’t have any side effects. Systolic of 140 is not very high, but it’s probably worth treating.
9. u/OrangeJews_Simpson [score=2, created=2025-11-05T10:32:50]: I'm Navy and I feel your pain. Unfortunately, I'm a flyer and I am not able to do my job unless I can prove my BP is managed to appropriate levels. At home, I'm fine (maybe slightly elevated) at the doc, it's like 150/100. I'm in lisinopril and doubling the medication does nothing. I'm not even sure it works at all tbh. I might go off of it for a few weeks and test myself at home to see if it changes my relaxed readings. I fear I have white cost hypertension, mixed with pre-hypertension at my natural state. Maybe I should try other meds, but I'm afraid to. But I know I won't get to the bottom of it or have them look into my kidneys unless we exhaust those options. I'll just have to accept that I will be in a down status (non-flying) for a while until we figure it out.
10. u/Adventurous-Effort96 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T02:44:51]: I had the same experience. 3 were crippling, Losinipril caused an inguinal hernia, and Losartan was the worst. And they did nothing to my BP. I take clonidine. I keeps my BP lowered. Side effects cotton mouth, constipation, spacey. I can live with that and they have improved with time. Check vitamin D and Iodine Intake status. Potassium to salt should be greater than 2:1 (DV is 4700 grams potassium. Vitamin D above 70 ng/dl; iodine intake around 600 mcg a day. Choose vegetables low in omega 6. Target is omega 6:3 ratio of less than 3:1.
