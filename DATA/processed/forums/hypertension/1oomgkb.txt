This might not be related but I feel kinda tingly/pins and needles in my legs and feet then I look at my watch that measures BP and it says like 106/70 and 110/70 (I don’t think my watch ever goes much lower probably not designed that way) and I know it’s not that low but I still think I feel tingly weird when it goes low ? Anyone else have this? It could be something unrelated too. I am on ramipril 5mg.

But my body is so used to my pressure being high that when it goes low passed a certain point, I feel ten times worse. But yeah tingling, dizzy, shaking, etc. If your BP is truly low, your feet will tingle because they’re getting less blood flow.
