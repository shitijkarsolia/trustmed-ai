===============================================================================

Basically, I'm basically prehypertension/hypertension 1 most of the time. im a 25yo male - I was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago I think. I also like to drink so not a great combo (drinking doesn't impede my work or lifestyle, mostly on the weekends but still not a great combo). My blood pressure has been really high lately due to alcohol consumption and stimulant medication. My normal blood pressure for a while has been 140-150/80-90... makes me feel like i have the chest of a hummingbird its terrible. so for now im going to take a break from drinking and ADHD medication. I've been walking to work (about 30 mins a day for a month now), but also supplementing. I bought some hawthorn berry supplements and hibiscus tea (i am not encouraging anyone to do this) after reading about it in a homeopathic book. my blood pressure when i woke up a few days ago was 140s/80s. i took the tea and supplements last night and my night blood pressure was 133/81 and my morning bp today was 119/68. I know that blood pressure is usually lower in the morning anyways but as i said my bp was pretty high when i woke up within the same week. also from other times i took a break from adhd meds it took two months not 6 days to effectively drop 20 points in both numbers. Im gonna keep supplementing and and taking measurements. then at some point i will introduce adhd medication again and see how it affects my bp while supplementing. i eat a relatively low salt diet and whole foods, the past two days i have steamed fish over past and spinach with vinegar. I also drink like 10-16 cups of water a day, so im sure the active variables are alcohol and adhd meds. the meds are mainly the culprit i can tell. it makes my body feel tensed up for so long but i feel focused etc... I'll probs update with any interesting findings but dont roast me if i forget lol. p.s. I also take magnesium, fish oil, and eat raw ginger and garlic, this seems to be the most dramatic shift but we'll see how it stacks up when i reintroduce the medication into my daily routine as well.
