===============================================================================

Here is the last couple of weeks of blood pressure taken. About me 35 male currently taking 5mg amlodipine twice a day and supposed to be taking 10mg nebivolol but backed myself down to 5mg because I hated the feeling of my heart rate being so low.

They ARE a bit elevated (if you want to hear it as the standards (*pharmaceutical*) are defined but actually they are great! I developed a habit out of knowledge gained over time and also over hospital stays and even my cardiologist's checkups that the most important reading is in the morning. There's a lot of stress, working and everything happening over the day that it's not representative. For example: I've done some wood cutting after work (3 hours of moderate to hard muscle workout) and in the evening my BP was 170/85. High? Definetly. Was my body doing regeneration? Yes. So it's normal? Yes. I would not take any more medication if I was you, it's great the way it is.
2. u/Aspen_GMoney [score=2, created=2025-11-06T00:43:30]: You are so close! How is your diet &amp; exercise? If there is room for improvement, then I feel like optimizing those would prevent you from starting another med. Also, the half-life of amlodipine is long enough, and you don't need to take 5mg twice a day unless directed by your physician. Now that I am writing this, you are on the max dose of amlodipine. Probably makes sense to either look into another hypertension agent or start changing your life around with diet/exercise. Whichever comes quicker and more consistent.

Well, truthfully, Nebivolol is actually a great medicine and has a lot of pro-effects that other medicines don't, like nitrous oxidation and perhaps some sexual positive or neutral effects compared to other beta blockers. But if you really feel bad on it, then obviously it makes sense to not take it. Having a lower heart rate is good at some point. What's your age, weight, and height?
