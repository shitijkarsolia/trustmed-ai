===============================================================================

So like most of you I've been on medication a few years and I was determined to not be. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was the final push so I lost the weight (around 25kg or 55lbs) it was enough to bring my BP right down at the time I was on 10mg amlodipine and 2.5mg indapamide. I tapered off the amlodipine with the guidance of my gp at the time and it's been about a year. I carried on the indapamide as my BP was in a really good place and side effects were minimal. In the past few months my BP was getting too low again so random dizziness and the odd headache. I started tapering off the indapamide to try and prevent rebound as I tried once before but went cold turkey and my BP bounced to 160/90 in a few days. This time Ive been up and down a bit but used information from studies about diuretic withdrawal and got AI to make me a plan. I've followed it and my last dose was on the 28th of October. As of yesterday I'm finally in a normal range with a little bit of instability which should settle after a few more days. While indapamide was a great drug for controlling my BP I started getting a lot of rashes (I used to have eczema) so that was my deciding factor indapamide has also become hard to get hold of in the UK so I didn't want to get to the point of just running out. Attached is my graph of the past week or so and as you can it's been a bit up and down. So I wanted to give a bit of hope to others who don't have genetically enforced hypertension that you can resolve and get off medication... Obviously not the same for everyone but don't get comfy on medication if you don't need to be!

When we notice that the condition is more advanced or that the patient lacks the initial discipline, we start medication, because we need to prevent further damage to the body. But the greatest gift is when a patient manages to change their lifestyle and decides they don’t want to depend on medication. That’s truly powerful. However, as others have said, the transition must be appropriate, controlled, and continuously evaluated — since medication helps regulate various body responses that lower blood pressure, and sometimes it takes a while for its effects to wear off. I always suggest this to people — I already have 13 Reddit users registered on my blood pressure tracking platform, which I created specifically for my hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients (including those in remission or those with a family history who want to stay alert). I’d like to invite you to join the platform as well, because beyond tracking your numbers, it helps guide your habits and gives you a much more accurate understanding of what you’re doing right — and what you’re not. You can even select whether you’re hypertensive or not, and the goals will automatically adjust. The link is in my bio — I’d love for you to check it out later. My suggestion for you: maintain the habits you’ve built — the mindset of change is powerful. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, and if possible, always monitor your sleep quality and stress levels. Do physical activities in zone 2 or zone 3, then assess your VO₂ max, always aiming to increase and make it more efficient. This is extremely helpful for achieving a better and more effective reduction in blood pressure. But congratulations already on the progress you’ve made!

3. u/edumedibw [score=1, created=2025-11-06T01:46:05]: Better to do a weekly average every couple of months.
4. u/GlenRH [score=1, created=2025-11-11T14:05:28]: If you don't mind me asking, what BP tracking app is that you use?
5. u/phild1979 [score=0, created=2025-11-07T12:07:32]: Bumping this again as I'd be curious to talk to someone who has been through what I'm currently going through, coming off a diuretic post hypertension.
