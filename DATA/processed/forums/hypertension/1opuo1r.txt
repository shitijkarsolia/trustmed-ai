===============================================================================

Short backstory: I have high blood pressure and I don't really understand why, I am newly 36, F, and 130 pounds at 5' 6". I don't smoke. I do drink wine, but not every day. I have been seeing a cardiologist for my heart rate (not BP) issues, but over the past year my blood pressure has truly shot through the roof and caused a more pertinent issue for me. If I sit for a good 5 minutes and relax, it tends to be about 155/117 or so, but often throughout the day it is over 160/120. My cardiologist's NP prescribed me amlodipine at 2.5mg a day, and told me it probably would not start lowering my BP for at least a week. My BP did not lower at all that week, as expected. Exactly one week after starting the med I woke up at 5:30 in the morning to my bones, muscles, joints, and skin aching. It felt like I had a bad flu, except I didn't feel sick or rundown at all, just in pain. Called the dr, they said it's not an emergency, but I can stop taking the med if I want to. Um, yeah. I wouldn't keep taking it if they told me I had to. Anyway, I usually took it at like 1pm, but I skipped that day's dose, and the next day (today) I feel much, MUCH better. I just wanted to post this out to the internet because I know that it's a supposedly rare side effect, and some of my googling showed me people developing mild joint pain after over a year on the medication. I don't know if I would have even put the two and two together if I had been taking to so long. So here is my story, up for anyone who googles something similar. I do not mean this as a warning not to take it, definitely try it, but if you experience these side effects, it's not a coincidence and you aren't the first! Another thing that I might have as a side effect of amlodipine is mouth ulcers (canker sores). I occasionally have one, but over the past week I have had two plus one developing. In the stuff I have read, mouth ulcers are actually a more common side effect of this drug than muscle/joint pain, and especially skin pain. Anyway, that's what I've been dealing with, and I would love to hear about other experiences on this medication, good or bad.

2. u/Clairefun [score=10, created=2025-11-06T03:24:10]: Bear in mind that sometimes what we think are side effects of the meds may actually be the body starting to adjust to / get ready to lower our blood pressures and will pass within a short while as our blood pressure lowers, especially when it's been high for a long time. Side effects of meds usually pass in a few days, also, but there's plenty of different ones you can try. Oh and so you're aware - accurate bp readings if taken at home are only the seated, rested, readings - and an average of three readings. Studies showing that many people get most accurate readings when seated 25 minutes first, but obviously we don't often get time for that. Have a read of the wiki here, it's got lots of info about accurate readings and so on. Good luck!
