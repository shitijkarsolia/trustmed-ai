Knowing it’s highly variable. Has anyone come across guidance as to how much a significant increase in pulse rate is correlated with an increase in one’s BP? My pulse goes from low 50’s while resting to 80-90 when checking BP. Doc seems to shrug it off, I’m not satisfied with that. Thanks in advance.

An increase in pulse from 50s to 80–90 when sitting up or checking BP can be normal due to activity, stress, or anxiety. But if you’re noticing consistent or dramatic changes, it might be worth asking for a more detailed evaluation (like orthostatic vitals or ambulatory BP monitoring) to rule out underlying issues.

I tend to sit down and take it almost right away because the anticipation of waiting 5 minutes causes anxiety. I know that first result is going to be high so I always throw it out. Once I see it’s what’s expected though (usually 150s/90 with a pulse in 90s), I do it a second time and use visual calming images. It’s usually petting my dog haha. Then I do it one more time and average the 2nd and 3rd. By then, my pulse is usually in the 70s, resting is 60s. My BP usually comes back down into acceptable ranges. My doc wants the second two readings below 130ish/85 knowing anxiety plays a part for me.

If I get a reading higher than whatever criteria my brain uses, it starts to rise dramatically. Like I’ve gone from 140/93 to 165/112 in like 90 seconds.
4. u/Fuchsia_Sky [score=3, created=2025-11-06T12:26:10]: My heart rate and bp is always up for the first readings because I'm anxious. I just sit and chill and do more readings as I calm down. Once I see my heart rate is normal I start believing the bp readings.
5. u/chmendez [score=2, created=2025-11-06T14:39:03]: That is the reason I can't trust the numbers I am getting My normal HR, being seated and calm is in high 60s/low 70s. When checking BP it rises above 100 very rapidly! I obviously get anxious/stressed
6. u/Ajay_Hellohealth [score=2, created=2025-11-07T00:11:15]: eah that happens a lot. the moment you think “i’m checking bp” heart kinda speeds up on its own. anxiety can push pulse up and make the bp look higher than it really is. try sit 5 mins, breathe slow, don’t talk, feet on floor, arm at heart level. do 2-3 readings with a minute gap, usually the later ones are more real. it’s not the machine issue most of the time, just the brain noticing itself.
7. u/Mosept11 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T02:19:34]: my HR goes up with my first BP reading. i think its anxiety that goes with the action
8. u/jxkingxRRS [score=1, created=2025-11-06T15:24:07]: My BP is around 120/80 but my pulse is always above 100 usually around 104 😒 very rarely am I ever below 90s and my best target is the 90s. Last reading for BP was 114/78 with a pulse of 102
