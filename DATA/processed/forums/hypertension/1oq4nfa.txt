New medication and worried about potassium intake. I take magnesium oxide at night and ARB morning. I drink 2 liter of water per day plus other drinks. The water is reverse osmosis. Not drinking tap water because it's softened with salt. I worry the reverse osomosis water because it has no electrolytes in and read that could be an issue while taking ARB. What should I do to keep electrolytes in check while keeping a low potassium intake? I'm probably overthinking this

1. u/see_blue [score=2, created=2025-11-06T10:43:50]: I’ve been on an ARB (losartan) for ~20 years. I’m essentially on a whole foods plant based, unavoidably high potassium diet rich in fruits, veggies, nuts/seeds, soy, berries, and whole grains. I see a GP and cardiologist yearly. The DASH diet for BP lowering recommends a high potassium diet, and MANY folks are on an ARB. The BP lowering benefits of a high potassium foods diet, far outweigh the risk of hyperkalemia. If you have kidney disease, ask your doctor. But on an ARB I would not supplement potassium or use potassium salt substitutes w/o a doctor recommendation.

Just look up a kidney friendly diet. Even with very little kidney function you can manage it with just changes to your diet, you really dont have to worry about water or anything like that
