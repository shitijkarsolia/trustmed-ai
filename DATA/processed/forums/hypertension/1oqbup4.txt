===============================================================================

I am about 5 months postpartum. A month and a half ago I went to go see the doctor, and had a high blood pressure reading 147/100. Then a month ago I went again and had another high blood pressure reading 150/102. I Then started regularly checking at home, which was trending down till this week when it started trending up again. I have a long history of anxiety but im not sure if this is anxiety related or something else. Ive lost nearly 50 lbs since my pregnancy putting my weight at around 148 for a 5'3 woman, still hoping to lose more and I am lightly active with 30 minutes of cardio via cycling the one exception was last week which my period completely derailed.
