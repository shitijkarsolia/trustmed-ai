238/134 bp. Has this happened to anyone in here? What was the outcome? He got really dizzy and had trouble walking. Doc says he had evidence of multiple mini strokes. I’m having a hard time tonight because I’m worried half to death about him and the doctor isn’t saying much I guess because he doesn’t know all the details yet. He is conscience and texting me but I’m just worrying myself to death because he’s treating this like it’s no big deal

I told him to go to the ER immediately because they needed to reduce that. God only knows how long he had been walking around like that. They kept him overnight and gave him a prescription for metoprolol and amlodipine. As far as i know, everything is okay now. His numbers are now in the 150s/80s, so not ideal, but definitely much better than before. I think your fiancé will be fine, but he will definitely need a workup from a cardiologist to make sure there are no other issues. Just make sure he takes his meds and try not to worry in the meantime.

The good news is that the issue has been identified and he is in the exact right place to get it under check. To be fair, it is best that your partner not panic and stay calm. Once it is under control (well, once the hypertensive crisis is over,) I am sure a plan of attack will be made with medication and lifestyle alteration recommendations. Wishing him all the best.

It's just way too easy in America to eat twice the daily sodium intake and not even notice. Do the DASH diet, exercise, and exercise more.

I had a hypertensive crisis 2 years ago where my BP shot up to 220/110 I immediately knew it was BP related cause it’s hereditary from my moms side of the family and I went on for 28 years ignoring it cause I was young and stupid but it came back to bite me.

I ended up with a pinched nerve in my from it - but also got 2 BP medications that sorted me out. As someone wise here said - your in the best place to be right now, and it is nice you have each other 💕 Wishing you both speedy help and a path to the best health. 💖
7. u/JustLoSd [score=3, created=2025-11-06T23:07:07]: I was in the ICU for a week with similar numbers. It took them a while to figure out what medications worked for me. He’s in good hands. Better than walking around with BP that high.
8. u/ProppaT [score=3, created=2025-11-07T11:35:11]: This was me two months ago. I spent two nights in the hospital stabilizing, they found evidence of mini strokes, etc. everyone’s situation is different but I wouldn’t make the situation worse by being visibly super worried, just help him through all the doctors appointments and follow ups after. It’s going to be a lot for him to handle finding out the root of the problem and he’ll need your support. I know I’m on three meds, barely stabilized, and still trying to figure out the cause because everything is normal except for some thickening of the heart. 46, 200lbs/6’3”, normal cholesterol…sometimes it’s just genetics and stress.
