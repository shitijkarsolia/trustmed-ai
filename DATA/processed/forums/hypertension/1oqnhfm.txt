===============================================================================

A good friend of mine was admitted to hospital last week after suffering a mini-stroke. He’s doing fine but when I had a chat with him his symptoms are very similar to how I’m currently feeling. I’m regularly feeling a little tight chested, across to my arms, occasionally pains into my neck. 46M - I’ve had high BP for over 10 years and I’m on 4 meds a day (9 tablets). Life is pretty stressful and I’m always on the go with work/family. My mum is currently in and out of hospital with consistent AF issues and potential heart failure and tbh I can’t stop thinking about trying to prevent me following in her footsteps. I requested a meds review with my doc last week and of course in the UK have to wait ages for a phone call which is scheduled for today. I’ve changed my diet considerably this year and lost 3 stone which I expected would significantly help my BP but it hasn’t. I’m hoping I can get a full MOT on my BP and heart to check what’s currently going on. Worried that something is around the corner and I’ll do what I can to prevent it. Any tips from this thread is most welcome. Tx

Ideally, it should be checked twice daily once in the morning, about 30 minutes after waking up (after using the washroom but before eating or having tea/coffee), and once at night, about one hour after dinner and before going to bed. This routine should be followed for two weeks, after which you can calculate the average of all readings to determine your true average blood pressure.

Worry /Stress can be a factor 😏 fortunately many helpful options are available. I also track water and track activity, or at home yoga stretches. It all helps.

Walk, walk, walk, and stress is not your friend. Get and keep good sleep hygiene, eat clean and walk walk walk. Those are things that are within your control. Hope talking things over with your doctor gives you some comfort.
