===============================================================================

After three months of worsening headaches I saw a GP on Wednesday this week. I thought it was a problem with my sinuses but my blood pressure was very high. 172/113. I've just taken my third dose of Ramipril 2.5mg and my blood pressure this morning was 125/85. My last three readings prior were 150/101, 148/100 &amp; 137/95. I know everyone is different but for those of you who have had hypertensive headaches, how long did it take for them to ease off? I'm still suffering with the tight band of pain round the back of my head or pain and pressure in my face. I'm trying to sleep and relax which this is stopping me from doing. I'm being reviewed again next Wednesday and have already put serious lifestyle changes in place, my dad died in his sleep due to a massive heart attack. I'm female and in my early 40's with a rubbish diet and a very stressful job so this is the wake up call I needed

When I got diagnosed with hypertension the pressure was squishing my optic nerves causing swelling which lead to head aches and vision issues. My pressure was 208/108 and I had to stay a week in the hospital while they ran tests and calibrated my meds. I think it took 3-4 days before I saw noticeable improvement in my headache and maybe 10 days before I was completely free of it
