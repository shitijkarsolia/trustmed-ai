They come in many levels of features, but the $50 dollar one is all you really need. All you need are two numbers : systolic and diastolic. Boom. Google the numbers and see how good or bad those numbers are. Done.

No need to mess with with the cuff. I'm never sure whether the cuff is too tight, loose, crooked etc. I'm curious to hear if anyone has tried this out?
