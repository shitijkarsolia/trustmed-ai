I’m around 412 lbs currently with hbp and on metoprolol tartate. Are there any supplements that you all use to improve ED and sexual performance while on blood pressure meds? I take a half of metoprolol tartate at day and night.

Seriously though going for a walk or something before hand will help alot. Also cut back on salty food it can make a big difference

You could end up with low blood pressure (Hypotension) or Dizziness while standing from a sleeping position (Orthostatic Hypotension) - if the dose strength is too high
