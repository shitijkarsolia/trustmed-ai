===============================================================================

Am I the most medicated person on this sub? 25mg of coreg twice a day. 5 mg of amlodipine twice a day. 100mg of spironolactone once a day. 2mg of doxazosin one a day. And now....80mg of Valsartan once a day as well, which I'll take tonight for the first time. Six months since I quit smoking, drinking, and caffeine. Have gone from 230 pounds to 205 pounds. Have seen an endocrinologist, it is *not* an aldosterone issue. I've had multiple ekgs, chest CT, an echo, an a renal artery ultrasound. All relatively normal. Had an exercise stress test, but couldn't get conclusive results, I had to stop early. So now I'm schedule for a CT angiogram. Blood pressure still averages 160/110. Still have shortness of breath and chest pain with minor exertion. I'm actually HOPING the angiogram shows blockage, because it's been almost 7 months with no answers. At least then I'll know what's going on and can fix it.

About CT scan and CT angiogram: https://www.docsopinion.com/coronary-calcium-score/ https://www.docsopinion.com/ct-calcium-score-vs-ct-coronary-angiography-understanding-the-difference/ Cholesterol results? Stopping a stress test early doesn’t sound great.
