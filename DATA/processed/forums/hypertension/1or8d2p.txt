But I also started an anxiety med about a month prior, and my doctor seems to think it's that (Buspirone) and *not* the Losartan since the former is known to cause dry mouth. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't keep me up at night because it makes it harder to swallow and triggers my anxiety. I've tried so many things with only very temporary relief. My doc said to try sour candy or lemon water. I am also trying to up my water each day to see if that helps because I definitely don't drink enough.
