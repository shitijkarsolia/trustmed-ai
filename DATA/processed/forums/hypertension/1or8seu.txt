===============================================================================

So after years of white coat hypertension and hoping my actual BP was ok my doctor set me up on a 24 hour monitor and says I’m in Stage 1 hypertension, should consider meds, and she wants to schedule an EKG. Pretty depressed about it especially since I just got on a statin — the first time on meds — a few months ago. And I don’t think my numbers were crazy high. I don’t have all the numbers yet but this is what I jotted down during the day (the big numbers at the start and end are when I was at the doctors getting and then dropping off the monitor). Averaged out it’s 126/72 though that may not be very scientific. I’m 62 (male) and I’m in pretty good shape (173 pounds, exercise five times a week). But I don’t think I can wish this away.

2. u/Biuku [score=7, created=2025-11-07T21:09:44]: You seem to be fine… but a bit worried. I take mine twice every few days… not 10 times in a few hours. I’d say, if you can worry less about this, that has to be healthy. The data says you can.
3. u/Equivalent-Cap8606 [score=6, created=2025-11-07T22:00:07]: Why are you taking it so many times in a day?
4. u/edumedibw [score=5, created=2025-11-08T03:32:11]: That’s perfectly normal and below average for your age
5. u/notsoeasypeasy [score=4, created=2025-11-08T06:25:01]: I wish I had your readings, I do!
6. u/Letthesparksfly69 [score=3, created=2025-11-08T00:47:41]: Your BP is fine!
7. u/creepy_gymnast [score=3, created=2025-11-08T04:38:09]: Looks good to me.
8. u/BarefootBagLady [score=3, created=2025-11-08T13:28:05]: Those numbers look pretty good, I'd not worry too much about them. Obviously listen to your doc but I'd ask for an explanation on what is bringing them to that conclusion. Less is definitely more sometimes 😊
9. u/Pure-Lunch80 [score=3, created=2025-11-08T13:52:35]: My physician would not Medicate numbers that low
10. u/Wildflowers4me [score=3, created=2025-11-09T06:28:30]: I question who decides what’s high and what’s normal for your age. I think they keep lowering the normal every year.
11. u/holisticbelle [score=2, created=2025-11-08T11:00:54]: Those numbers are mostly very normal :)
12. u/Weird_Fun1493 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T12:56:32]: Even if you do end up on meds for your BP you don't have to be on them forever. I used to be on 3, then 2 and now i am on 1 pill for BP. My late dad used to be on BP meds but for the last 3 years of his life he wasn't on any because he had falls due to low BP! Its not failure some are on pills 3 days old and I think you have done well to get to your age without pills.
