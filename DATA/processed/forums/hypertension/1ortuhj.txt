===============================================================================

feel like crying all day. i exercise everyday and have been on hypertension meds for 10 years and i am 29 now. Was on amlodipine and telmisartan first and then i lost weight and doc just put me on telmisartan 40 cause my bp was falling to 100/60. in 2023 i developed a panic disorder and before that all my in office readings were 120-30/80. suddenly during the panic attack the bp spiked to 200 and that started happening everyday. i moved in with my parents and started checking my bp everyday for 2 years. no relief from OCD of bp checking all day despite paroxetine. Now im not on any meds. Today my bp was high since the morning and it was 146/86 and then 123/80 as well. Average was 131/79 from 70 readings. Severe chest pain as well. Started panicking in the evening and bp reached 190/100 and then rushed to thje ER where they confirmed the reading. Severe headache and chest pain. ECG was normal. Gave me clonzapam 0.25 and checked after 1 hour and it was 144/92 and then discharged me. Got home and ate food and it was 125/82 and now it is 116/65. However ive been checking my bp everyday and i have severe anxiety as well. yesterday i checked my bp during a severe headache and it was not going below 140/80. My doc is not adding any meds as my tests are normal 3 echos, 300 ECGs, HSCRP is 0.1, LFT, KFT, Ultrasounds, renal dopplers, urinary metanephrenes, CT calcium scan with a score of 0, TMT with METS of 12.7, thyroid, iron, all vitamins and magnesium, all electrolytes are normal, HB1AC is 5, fasting sugar is 85, evening and morning cortisol in normal limits, uric acid All tests done under the sun, Idk what to do and im really paranoid about the 130/80 new threshold and sometimes im hitting even 150s without panic. im 69 kgs and 5 feet 11 - super athletic, gym everyday and crossfit 3 times a week. Ive been to over 10 cardiologists and when they see 170/100 in office reading theyimmediately prescribe amlodipine as well but my PCP asked me not to take any more meds in addition to telmisartan 40. Out of the 10 cardiologists 7 asked me not to take any meds. What do i do? Today at 190 it felt like i was having a stroke. Severe headache, thudding heart. I cant take beta blockers as my RHR is 45 idk why this is happening to me. Cant drink coffee. Sober for 2 years. No drink or smoke at all. I have travelled the globe, partied, enjoyed myself without BP ever being a problem!!!!! Now its ruined my life. My PCP asked me to stop measuring it but when i start feeling unconfortable i check it and it viola it is 150 and then 160 and keeps increasing. What is going on????? rn after the hospital visit with klonopin 0.25 im at 105/65 after dinner!!!!! when i got back from the hospital it dropped to 120/75!

You haven’t died or had a stroke, despite this going on for years. Instead, anxiety and mood disorders are ruining your living life; not your elevated BP. You don’t mention therapy, but that’s where I’d focus my energy on.

You have been to 10 cardiologists and all was fine. What else do you want? You can go to 20, 100, 1000 and the result will be the very same... Sorry for the harsh words. As someone who used to have panic attacks years ago in a similar way. What helped me was a doctor at the ER who literally told me: "You don't belong here and you're distracting our work with patients that really need us. I don't want to see you here again." This was a pivotal moment for me, I got my things soon sorted out. That it goes up to 200 in a panic attack is not something unexpected. If you run up a steep hill with full effort it will be also in that range or even higher. What matters is how it is first thing in the morning and in the evening before you go to sleep. That being said I have much higher readings than you have when your readings are regular. I don't like what I see, but for that I have a GP to work with. Please stop measuring that often. Get help with your anxiety/panic attacks and you likely will be fine. You're still young and enjoy the sportive activities you do. My fingers are crossed for you. 🙏

6. u/Leotiaret [score=2, created=2025-11-08T10:39:54]: I have anxiety and when I’m feeling anxious my BP is much higher 150/100 or more from 120/80 or less. Usually it will go down if I rest, deep breath. My doctor knows I have BP issues with anxiety so when it’s high at the clinic they’ll chat with me and when they take it again it’s lower. Anxiety meds help also. I personally don’t worry about elevated blood pressure as long it doesn’t go over 140/90 since it’s usually temporary as blood pressure changes throughout the day. My clinic also looks at my numbers at home. They are always consistently in good range so if I have a higher reading at the clinic they don’t worry about it. O

Listen to music. Soak in a hot bath and free your mind. Sometimes just taking your BP can add to the stress. Stop obsessing over your numbers. Once I stopped taking my BP and learned to quiet my brain, my high BP symptoms went away. I’m learning to quiet my brain myself. I’m an over thinker and my break up has my brain on major overload. It sucks. I can’t get moments rest. I have to give myself pep talks and reassure myself to get my negative thoughts out of my head. Life is stressful and we all need to learn to slow down, relax and enjoy life. Your numbers are fine. Mine never gets below 150/100 or higher. But all my tests come back fine. I’m told I have a healthy heart 🤷‍♀️ my hr goes 60-137 every day. I try not to stress on it but be aware!
