High gang. I went to my cardiologist about 6 months ago. Wake up call bp 170/100 then down to 150/90 after relaxing a bit. The doc put me on amlodipine 5mg. In addition have been eating much cleaner and walking everyday. My avg bp is now 100/110 over 65/75 My question is should I ask to lower the amlodipine at this point? Or continue the course?

What I don’t know is whether they did a week of home readings or ambulatory bp monitoring prior to starting to confirm bp elevation. If not i no suspect the starting bp wasn’t as high as people thought. Eg situational raised white coat etc
