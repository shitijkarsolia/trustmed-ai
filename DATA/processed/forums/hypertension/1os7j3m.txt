I wanted to share with this group since I’ve gained so much value from this forum. Sometimes I think people don’t share their positive results enough, and it can really skew people’s ideas of what medicating hypertension will be like. I put off getting medicated for 15 years. My story was basically diagnosed with hypertension at age 20 and didn’t start taking medication until age 35. In between I tried a variety of things such as drinking large amounts of beat and celery juice, eating so little sodium a day that I was getting headache, and trying to run 5K daily to make my hypertension go away. 140 systolic to start creeping up to 150 and higher. I was so hesitant to try medicine because I had heard like the side effects were terrible and it doesn’t actually you know fix the problem—which I don’t deny. Sitting in the doctors office one day after yet another high reading, I shared with the doctor the list of supplements I was taking, and he was like: “What you are trying to achieve can be gotten with medicine. And these medicines have gone through clinical trials. Your supplements from the vitamin store have not.” Further more I had left ventricle hypertension from the years of not treating it. This was about a year ago. 50mg of Losartan a year later I have it under control. I even took that reading at a Wal Mart blood pressure machine which typically would give me high readings. I was lucky to find success on the first medicine prescribed. The pill along with some increased exercise and giving up bacon—I used to eat daily—led me here. I encourage those on fence to get medicated to please think about it. Wish all the best.

Then it clicked, I realized if I can't naturally lower bp, then the meds are the only choice to continue living.
5. u/dchobo [score=3, created=2025-11-08T20:32:20]: Thanks for sharing! Did you start with 50mg? Or something lower? How long did it take for the medication to get the results? Also did you keep up with diet and exercise? Thanks

8. u/CatWoman984 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:34:00]: I am on this same mg of Losartan but with 12mg of HCTZ, I'm wondering if it'll work better without the HCTZ? I think I've hears that somewhere
