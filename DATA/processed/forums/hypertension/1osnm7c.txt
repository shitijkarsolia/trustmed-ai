===============================================================================

For context, I’m 29 now. I was first put on BP medication (amlodipine + telmisartan) when I was 20. At that time, I was 95 kg, obese, living on junk food, drinking heavily, smoking daily around 15 cigs and my clinic BP readings were around 150/100. Even at rest it used to be 140/90 on both those meds. During COVID, I lost 40 kgs with exercise and a clean diet and dropped to 59 kgs. My BP at the doctor’s office became 100/60, I felt light-headed all the time, so my doctor stopped amlodipine and eventually stopped all BP meds. This was after around 6 years of using them. Soon after, my BP started going up again (around 140/90), so telmisartan 40 mg was added back. For the next \~3 years, even though I drank and smoked on weekends (12 beers + 1 pack of cigarettes sometimes), my in clinic BP stayed stable — usually 110/80 to 120/80. I felt completely fine. Never checked at home as i didnt have any obsessions about health. Even during severe headaches it barely went above 130. I had always been anxious but i was drinking a strong starbucks coffee as soon as i used to wake up which was causing severe palpatations and sweating all over. I thought why not check my bp in the morning but it was always great so i stopped and threw the machine away. i was frustrated. I was told that headaches are caused by high bp and i was sitting with perfectly normal bp even after a night of heavy drinking lol. I also continued exercising everyday. In October 2023 everything changed. After a night of heavy drinking, I had my first panic attack — HR racing, BP at the hospital was \~200, they gave me 0.25 mg clonazepam and within 30 mins it dropped to 120. That event triggered severe health anxiety. At that time, I was also under major stress (job issues + relationship breakup). At the cardiologist’s clinic my BP was 146/92, echo and ECG were normal, but she still advised increasing telmisartan to 80 mg. I refused because I knew it was anxiety — just a few days before, while travelling in Bangkok, my BP was 120/70. Then I made the mistake of buying a BP machine. I checked repeatedly — first reading was 130, then 140, then 160, and by the fourth check it was 180. Panic → ER → normal tests → sent home. And this cycle repeated almost daily. I moved back to my parents’ house because of fear. Since then I’ve had: * 3 normal echocardiograms * 300+ normal ECGs * Normal kidney/liver function, thyroid, cortisol, electrolytes * Normal renal doppler, CT calcium score = 0 * Normal TMT (12.7 METs), HbA1c 5.0, fasting sugar 85 * Normal urinary metanephrines (so no pheochromocytoma) * hsCRP 0.1, no inflammation Every ER visit was the same: BP 170–190/110, mild anti-anxiety med → BP drops to \~140 → ECG is normal → discharge. Last year I started paroxetine. Within a month, my BP averaged 115/60, lowest was 110/49. But I stopped it because my obsession with checking BP didn’t stop. Then panic returned. Now what’s scaring me is: even when I’m calm, my BP has been around 132–135 systolic for the last few days. My doctor told me to stop checking it, but my whole body feels tense and I can’t tell whether it’s anxiety or actual high BP returning. In the morning however it was 115/65. Sober 2 years, no coffee, last cig 3 years ago

Your BP is fine and will improve if, and only if, you get treatment for your anxiety, as we told you on your post yesterday. You need to listen to your doctor.
2. u/amosthagreat [score=2, created=2025-11-09T09:45:01]: Just think about all those tests you have done and they are all good that should give you relief . I’m the same anxiety towards checking BP. If my heart is racing and I feel anxious I know that number is not correct. Take a break from checking it for a while and keep reminding yourself you have had lots of test and all good and you have checked your BP a lot and sure there were some high but most were low and that’s good. You are young and healthy. Continue to make healthy choices and don’t feed anxiety and check your BP all the time. Hope you feel better.
3. u/antoniateresa [score=2, created=2025-11-09T09:52:36]: I think that you should speak to your doctor to prescribe you some Benzodiazapine (eg. CLONAZEPAM) which will also help in lower your BP besides reducing stress. And, don't mind me saying that you should throw away your BP reading machine for a while or at least use it sparingly. If the above doesn't help fully - discuss with your doctor about adding a mild diuretic (like Hydrocholorothiazide (HCT) - along with your other BP medications
4. u/Rude_Kaleidoscope641 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T09:53:20]: I also deal with health anxiety that is centered around my blood pressure. It started after a botched medical procedure that turned into 3 major surgeries and a permanent issue with my right renal artery. I’m trying to manage the fear of taking my BP by proactively eating clean, getting good sleep, exercising, and lots of breathing exercises. It is what I can control in a situation that was foisted on me by a bad Dr. I can only wish you well— try to focus on what is in your control and then try to leave the rest in the hands of whatever higher power you may have faith in. All your tests are normal, and that is a huge blessing! Sending you good energy and hope that you will find a pathway to good mental health again. You aren’t alone with what you are dealing with.

Same here, you can open thousands of threads. But the thing is you're actually the only one that can help yourself. 🤗 PS: Stop drinking, it won't make it better.
6. u/Vrzistran_racun [score=2, created=2025-11-09T10:48:55]: It's kinda like reading my story, except I'm 30. Drank, had fun, had a lot of stress, am a dad that sees his son over the weekends or every 2 weekends now that he's a big boy (13 y/o). I never did check my BP because on my hardest days in life 5 years ago, when the doctors didn't know what's wrong with me and how to save my life, my BP was 125/70. On 8 mg of candesartan! And I survived and am fine! So fast forward on new year's of this year, after a night of heavy drinking (I was a moderate drinker before) and smoking I had a tingling feeling inside me and shaking hands like never before. I thought damn, I should check my BP and drove home from my gf's house. I barely made it home and my BP was...220/130. 230/150 when I came to the ER. I was feeling.. fine? On a weird way. They gave me a pill and in 30 minutes it dropped. Came home and the panic attacks continued. Every 3 days I called my cousin (who is a nurse), shaking like a fish out of water and asking for help. I thought I was gonna die. I was checking my BP and first reading was 160/80 which made thing worse. My doctor at the time was a young doctor who had no experience with LIFE. She had experience with pills, medications and statistics. And new guidelines and borderlines for BP. So she gave me a strong dose of a combination pill called Amcandin (Amlodipine 10 mg and Candesartan (that I used before) 16 mg (double dose)) without asking what I do for myself, for my work or anything life related. Eager to find a solution I started to use my watch daily and check my heart rate. Not a good idea. It worsened everything. I thought everything over 75 was going to kill me. The medication also took life from me. Like literally, I wasn't the same, constantly tired, on the verge of passing out. But my BP average was 150/85. So after a month of suffering and occasional drinking/smoking I decided to lower my alcohol intake/smoking, start eating healthier. Bought an exercise bike. Beetroot juice. Fish 3 times a week. No fast food, low fats, almost 0 salt. For anxiety I took some natural based pills that you can buy in the pharmacy but are natural, non-addictive and cannot do anything else except relax you and your mind. I felt stoned and barely productive so after 3 weeks of using, I stopped. It kind of helped me sleep though. But I used that (still do) a lavender spray for pillows and sheets. Works wonders. BP remained high so I decided to take my health to a new, unknown level and went to a psychotherapist. Even though I spent much more money that I thought (4 sessions, 300€) I got some guidelines, that's it. I stopped therapy after 4 sessions because I had a feeling they wanted to maximize money take from me without providing too much help. Which confirmed after trying with 2 other psychotherapists. I wanted to work with something and all I got from them are questions, not guidelines or help, not even recommended books! Went to my cardiologist (somehow I got to him 3 months after last visit, even though I have a regular, 2 year check up) and he said "you're a slave to your BP. Measure 1 or 2 times a week (more if it's high as hell, like over 160/90) but only in the morning and make sure you rest 10 minutes before, no eating 30 mins befre, etc. etc. you know the drill. You're clearly overdosed, we're gonna halve this amlodipine and go from there"
7. u/LillyBitz [score=2, created=2025-11-09T20:41:50]: Your health is fine. It sounds like anxiety. You should only check your blood pressure at most twice a day. Also 135 is not that high for systolic!
8. u/see_blue [score=1, created=2025-11-09T10:16:49]: Next stop, atrial fibrillation (a-fib), although it sounds as if you’ve already had an event. Binge drinking is a MAJOR risk factor as well as smoking, stress, poor diet, sleep and other lifestyle factors. See: r/AFIB We can’t help you. You need to feel worthy enough to stop the self-harm. That’s for a therapist.
9. u/Wrinklysocks22 [score=0, created=2025-11-09T11:35:09]: I was told I run "hot". Type A
10. u/StrawberryPlains [score=0, created=2025-11-09T22:37:43]: If you feel you must check your blood pressure, have someone else do it for you and not report the result to you unless it's crazy high. Anxiety and stress is not your friend. Read your other post as well, seriously, you need to talk to someone qualified to help you. Best wishes to you.
