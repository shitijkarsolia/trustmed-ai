===============================================================================

Basically I've likely had hypertension 2 for years now (in my early 30's) and I can swear I've had recent brain fog, and other symptoms like shortness of breath, and fatigue (it kind of 'feels' like my heart is overworked), but reading things here, I'm starting to wonder if all of that is placebo and there are actual no symptoms from hypertension. I did just start medication btw

2. u/edumedibw [score=3, created=2025-11-09T14:51:21]: Yep unless a secondary cause or malignant hypertension
3. u/PeterPaul0808 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T15:01:18]: My heart is good but even though I take medications sometimes it can jump high like 150-60/90 and I don't feel anything. It happens usually when the weather changes and after it goes back to normal 120/70. I am suffering from hypertension since I'm 17 and now I'm 36 (M). So I think it is a placebo but worth to check your heart.

5. u/Character_Acadia_576 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T16:19:07]: Have you been taking your BP at home? These symptoms sound like my symptoms when my BP goes low. Maybe your meds are making you go low?
6. u/Clairefun [score=1, created=2025-11-09T16:24:41]: For most people it has no symptoms, hence being called the silent killer. I didn't have any at 245/160, but I did have migraines 'on the way there' - about a month before I had the eye stroke that finally got my bp discovered. Lots of people think their anxiety / panic attack symptoms are caused by high bp, because obviously their bp is high when they're having those symptoms, but they don't realise its anxiety causing the symptoms *and* the bp, understandably. In rare cases with longer term higher numbers, some will get headaches, blurred vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds. So no - not all are placebo, but some are anxiety, and some will be other health issues which could also be causing the high bp - or even 'just' side effects from the lifestyle that could be causing the bp, too. It's complicated, and everyone is different!
7. u/Ajay_Hellohealth [score=1, created=2025-11-10T05:19:06]: nah it’s not placebo, some people really feel things like fog, tiredness, or that heavy heart feeling. but the tricky part is high bp itself often doesn’t cause clear symptoms, so it’s easy to mix what’s real and what’s anxiety or stress from knowing you have it. once your meds settle and pressure stays normal, you’ll see what’s actually your body and what was worry.
8. u/Front_Society1353 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T05:37:41]: Depends how high, I can assure you over 220/120 you can feel it.
9. u/ExquisiteGerbil [score=1, created=2025-11-10T15:40:43]: As someone who was going blind because the high pressure was squishing my optic nerve and restricting blood flow to the eyes: No, not all hypertension symptoms are psychosomatic. I got treated in time but have some permanent damage in my right eye
