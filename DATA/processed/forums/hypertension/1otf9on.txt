===============================================================================

Hi there, I (M32) am having an appointment with my GP soon as my blood pressure got pretty high in the last weeks (150/95). The thing is I also suffer from depression and I am afraid that, for example, Beta-Blockers might exacerbate my depressive symptoms. Has anyone been in a similar situation and could share his/her experience about it or might know which medication could be suitable (Of course I am going to discuss it with my Doc extensively)

I've gotten to a point where I'd badly like to wrestle free from my other blood pressure meds via weight loss, but even then I will cling to the low-dose beta blockers as they've been a miracle for my anxiety. I suppose that's a little different than straight depression.

ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (especially depending on your ethnicity) are usually first line. Beta blockers had a tendency to affect libido, so they rarely start you on them.

I only got despressed on one very specific med (Nefidipine) but all other meds I have and have had were fine when it comes to depression. So if one isnt right for you, just try another. Finding one that works should very well be doable.
