===============================================================================

Hey all. 45 Male. Have been on Nebivolol for about 3 years now. Was on Metoprolol for about 4 months, but horrible side effects for me, so they switched me over to Nebivolol then. I'm taking it because of high blood pressure. I wasn't very kind to my body growing up, and had a couple AFib episodes about 4-5 years ago. The thing is, they only happened after I drank heavily or went on a bender, which I mentioned repeatedly to my cardiologist at the time. One episode, they had to put me under and do a cardioversion. My blood pressure was averaging 140 over something before the medication. Now, I've had hardly any side effects from it, except for two. And that is a complete lack of sex drive. To the point of being almost non-existent. And it's starting to severely affect my relationship. She feels like it's something to do with her, and she has every right to feel that way. I would were the roles reversed. And I've assured her that is not the case. But has anyone else had this problem on Nebivolol? To this extent? The other problem is quality of sleep. I always wake up every two hours or so for no reason. Not debilitating, but has definitely affected sleep amounts and quality over the years. I also take baby aspirin and Atorvastatin. Now, about 6 months ago, I decided to change my lifestyle completely. 100 percent sober, exercise 4 times a week, and eat clean and healthy. My BP now averages 115-120 over something, but I'm also still on the Nebivolol. I'm seriously thinking about quitting it. For anyone that is no longer on it, did your sex drive improve? Back to what it was before you started taking it? Did your BP remain stable with diet and exercise alone? Did your sleep quality improve any? Thank you in advance and much appreciated.

Have an honest conversation about your sexual side effects. It's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed to talk about and it's a VERY common side effect of beta blockers, even Nebivolol, so they've heard it all. I also found that my sleep quality was pretty bad on Nebivolol. I've found extended release melatonin or delta 8 helped me a lot, but that's up to you to decide what to take. Additionally, if Nebivolol is working well for you, ask if Sildenafil or Tadalafil is an option for you. They can be taken with beta blockers without serious side effects if they are monitored with your doctor.

I feel my libido is coming back but it’s taking awhile..

The booze has to go; for good. Any alcohol but worse, binge drinking is bad for a-fib. A-fib can be progressive once it starts, and lifestyle factors become more important. Also high BP and a-fib often go hand in hand. You want to treat your BP. Your ED could be due simply to your lifestyle and aging and signs of developing ASCVD; you’re on a statin. I’m decades older than you, but going plant-based improved my minor ED, and eliminated all pains, aches (no more back or sciatica pain, at all), and improved exercise recovery. Viagra or similar for ED works, and can be an aid in managing the sex part. You don’t have to let on about it at first…
