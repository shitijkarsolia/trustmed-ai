===============================================================================

The low reading I took when laying down and then took the other *higher reading immediately after while sitting . I took it twice and it was unchanged. Can drinking one energy drink (70 mg caffeine) an hour or 2 before bp raise it that much ? i have an anxiety disorder as well and take Ativan and I also take clonide but I only take a quarter of a 0.1 mg pill a day. I've been very anxious about my blood pressure lately and vision etc

What matters is when you take it the proper way. And for the record, blood pressure fluctuates almost constantly throughout the course of the day.
