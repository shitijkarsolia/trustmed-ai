===============================================================================

He was prescribed amlodipine 5mg and lisinopril 30mg. The pharmacy said it can make him dizzy, but it should go away in a couple weeks. He is a truck driver. If y'alls experience, when they say dizzy, is this common? Does it last all day, for a few minutes? We're going to have him start on the weekend to be safe, but if it's a problem I'm worried he won't be able to take these meds. Just looking to see what others experienced!

2. u/MariaBelk [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:39:03]: I haven't taken those exact drugs, but my experience when starting a new blood pressure medication is that it causes dizziness only on the first day, and just for a couple hours (or less).

Have him be cautious when he gets up from sitting, lying down,or bending over. Do it slowly and he should be ok. I’m on 100mg of Losartan and 2.5mg of Amlodipine, and I’ve only experienced momentary dizziness occasionally if I get up too fast. My diastolic numbers were high like your husband’s, and my medication has brought mine down to normal. Tell your husband to take walks when he can, and avoid processed foods (which is probably very difficult as a truck driver) Best of health to him!

6. u/CoyoteLitius [score=1, created=2025-11-12T10:26:26]: I had no dizziness (with just lisinopril). Did the doctor ask him to keep a BP log? There's a travel BP cuff for the wrist is which is fairly accurate. I have had several changes of BP meds and each time was warned of dizziness, so paid attention to it every time I got up from a reclined or seated position. I never had any dizziness on low doses of BP medication. However, I did faint one time. It happened rapidly after standing up and walking about 6 feet. And it was due to a recent increase of dose of lisinopril. I learned to take my BP twice a day while beginning any change in BP medication (my BP was \~80/38 when I fainted - I sort of wilted, I didn't fall - and once down, it was only a couple of seconds until I was aware again and wondering what I was doing on the kitchen floor).
