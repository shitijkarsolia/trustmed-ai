I notice my blood pressure is high when I'm up cooking. Just now I was prepping chicken salad and I sat down to take my bp and it was 151/92 after sitting for about 3 mins it came down to 130/88. Is this normal to be this high when up doing something?

There are instructions on the internet, in the wiki of this subreddit, at doctors offices, and supplied with most blood pressure monitors. It will be higher than rested readings should be, when you're active. 5 minutes seated quietly and calmly is the minimum, though studies show the majority of people get the most accurate readings after 25 minutes of resting quietly before taking an average of three. (It's pretty rare anyone has time for that, though!).
