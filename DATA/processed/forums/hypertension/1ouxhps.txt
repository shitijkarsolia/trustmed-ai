===============================================================================

34 years old and just got put on my second medication for blood pressure. Got put on 25mg of losartan at 30yo. Went up to 50mg last year. Now I just got started on 5mg of amlodipine. I feel very discouraged and it's giving me a lot of anxiety. Over the last few years I've really improved my diet. A I lost 20-25lbs. My BMI is right at 24-25. I eat red meat maybe once a week. Eat out like once every other week. Everything else is home cooked meals. I don't add salt to anything. I buy unsalted stuff when I can. Cut my saturated fats down to like nothing. I eat the most vegetables in my house. Cut my sugar back significantly. I've been doing a ton of extra walking the last year to hear and a half. Dont have sleep apnea. Never smoked. Never really drank besides a few parties when I was younger. Ive reduce the stress in my life pretty significantly the last couple years. All my labs look perfect besides a thyroid one that was off just 0.4. I don't know what else to do. I've spent the last few weeks just spiraling out of control just making it worse im sure. Dreading dying young or ending up an open heart patient in my 40s. Any words of advice? Anyone else been in a similar situation and eventually had some luck?

My comes and goes, up to 200/100 but most times hovers around 175/90s… I can’t take meds long terms due to other health Issues. When it’s over 170, I take Clonidine AND a large (120z) cup of pure beet root, not from concentrate ones. Reduce within few hours. Been doing this for the last 6yrs. Also resting is crucial for me, when it spikes, I find a place to rest and close my eyes. It helps me.

3. u/MirandaPoth [score=2, created=2025-11-13T03:28:37]: My BP stayed stubbornly high though lots of different medications/combinations of meds. I was similarly fed up and worried. I kept talking to my GP and eventually saw a cardiologist and we finally found the combination of medications/timings of doses that works for me. It was such a relief. So don’t give up. You’re doing everything right, some people are just prone to hypertension. Try not to get too anxious or obsessed with taking your readings - that in itself can make it much worse. Find a good cardiologist (or other HCP - I think it can be hormone-related too) and keep trying.

I began doing wall sits 3 times a week. At first I could only do 4 sets of 45 seconds. But now I am at 4 sets of 2 minutes each which is the recommended protocol for BP benefits. After just one month of doing these and not changing anything else in my life, my BP readings are always under 125/80

6. u/CorvusGraves [score=1, created=2025-11-15T00:11:02]: Losartan absolutely gave me anxiety, which has now progressed into panic disorder. Before I found out I had high BP and started drugs to lower it, I was pretty ok. Then, after a couple months on Losartan I started having crippling cardiac anxiety. I get these crazy feelings in my chest, just for like a moment, and it feels like I am having a heart attack. I've had multiple ECG, blood tests, holter monitor, been to the ER dozens of times all to be told it's anxiety. Even when I got off Losartan for a while, the panics and anxiety stayed. ...And now I'm back on Losartan+Ativan. Yay!
