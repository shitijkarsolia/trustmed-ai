(they keep repeating to make sure and there's nothing left), what can i possibly do? my AASI on ABPM peaked at 0.82 in 2024; it was 0.64 last time a few months ago and 0.34 in 2023; in general they ruled out an \*inherent heart problem\* not caused by my hypertension, so i'm just stumped. i've been posting about it all this time on my twitter account; and i'm hoping to make some friends here and perhaps learn more; because i'm stumped. https://preview.redd.it/nwq6so7b6s0g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055421b2b125d17d09545b7b41601b6e25e5b62f funnily enough; if you see a few readings i took on my home monitor (i had it checked)... https://preview.redd.it/hjftsj6e6s0g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43dadf92e95a86b37a951031735eead4263aff40 https://preview.redd.it/szr1h36f6s0g1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2824f1d186b49f399d7e01b21cdecfe2e2530a5a https://preview.redd.it/oknian4g6s0g1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c4df1eda1f390339d80d5032dcc84225590d49 ...you may note that i contributed the photo for hypertensive crisis on wikipedia. https://preview.redd.it/zqu7ev8l6s0g1.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae09fc32d2e66eb5aa2c3c35d410e356963b8d85 also, this reading's quite a bit more dubious as it was in an emergency setting and they obviously did not fit an arterial line, but around february 2025 it seemed my blood pressure rose above 300 systolic; given that no manual or automatic blood pressure cuff from numerous paramedic crews could read my BP; inflating to the max and then returning an error for the automatic ones, and inflating to the max on the manual ones and having the lead paramedic just go "i hear the sounds; i don't know what it is but it's extremely high"; i had rang for chest pain. i'm hoping also to make some friends in this community; thank you. my main question is what could possibly be at play here? i less just want to yap about my experience and more find some answers and discuss perhaps anyone with a similar age to me (18) who may have similar experiences; so i know i'm not alone. thank you very much. i'm also willing to answer any questions. \~ erika

Or is that just while at hospital? I'm just wondering why you're not on a beta blocker yet and couldn't see on your post. I used to average 245/160 long term, also malignant, had an eye stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomegaly, lowered ejection fraction (51), thickened chamber walls, tachycardia, a murmer, and chronic kidney disease from hypertensive nephropathy. For me, tests found it was caused by a kidney failing after severe and chronic hydronephrosis, itself caused by damage from a surgery 4 years before, had been misdiagnosed as a kidney infection so went untreated. I'm also autistic, incidentally! I'm on 10mg amlodipine, 2.5mg bisoprolol and 50mg losartan and it's worked well, eventually, to bring my bp down and my heart rate reasonably normal. Due to the meds, my heart returned to normal size and function, though still have a murmur, and after 2 years I was discharged from the retinal clinic with only a small but permanent blind spot in one eye. The kidney disease is stable. So hopefully they'll get you on meds that work for you and lower your bp slowly. I started at a higher average than yours so your mileage may vary, and because of the heart stuff they wanted to lower it very slow, so for me it took about 8 months of my rested averages dropping like 3-5 points every week! Frustrating, especially those weeks where it didn't drop or I'd go back up again, but it got there eventually. I was told that it was likely I'd been averaging around 245/160 for 'months or years' so it needs to lower slowly to avoid more strokes, and more damage, so it might be quicker or slower for you. I hope they get you sorted soon!
