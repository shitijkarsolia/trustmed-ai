Has anyone tried both Irbesartan and Valsartan, how did you feel with each in terms of sleep quality, fatigue, blood pressure control, mood changes (anxiety, depression). Thank you for your input.

2. u/see_blue [score=1, created=2025-11-12T16:43:24]: I’ve been on both. I can’t recall why I switched. But side effects attributed to either med at the time was not the sole issue for changing. I was on Avapro (irbesartan) for several years w good use. I wouldn’t object today using that med. My BP is borderline and doctors often would try another drug to see if it worked better, or I was complaining of a weird side effect. I sorta went through most all the ARB’s and settled on losartan (~last 20 years). And yes it has minor or annoying side effects too. Often related to ambient temperature.
