===============================================================================

I started on lisinopril 20mg a few days ago. I am 38yo male, blood pressure readings were typically high 130/80’s to mid 140/90’s (and family history of heart issues). Is there an adjustment period for this medication? I hadn’t had any dizziness or blurred vision, but just feel kinda off/weird, sometimes with a mild headache. Also been more fatigued than normal. At home bp readings seem to indicate the meds are working though. I am also very active ( CrossFit 5x/week for the last 10 years) and have felt even more “off” during most workouts.
