===============================================================================

I’m wondering if anyone has experienced chronically dry lips from Lisinopril. I know that dry cough is common, and I do experience bursts of mild dry cough from time to time, but my lips and mouth seem to suffer the worst. Nothing cures it, and only Aquaphor provides /some/ relief. I started on 10mg in 2021 and have been on 5mg for the last year. I began experiencing chronic dry lips in 2021, so that’s why I’m considering Lisinopril to be the culprit. Edit: 30F, 5’5 145lbs
