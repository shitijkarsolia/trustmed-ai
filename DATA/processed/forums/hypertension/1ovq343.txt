===============================================================================

Sorry for not posting the daily update for the last few days. I am on day 5 of a water-only fast. I am in ketosis and have lost weight. Most of the loss is likely water retention from my previous bad diet. There is no change in my blood pressure yet. I feel disappointed and demotivated. I have done prolonged water only fast one time before and I started seeing BP drop significantly around day 7 and 8 when my weight had dropped to around 160 lbs. I now get very anxious before checking my blood pressure. That might be contributing to make it higher. I feel like I should avoid checking it every day until I lose more weight and get my weight under 160 lbs. **Sleep:** ~5hr (avg of last 5 days) **Steps:** 6593 (avg of last 5 days) **Healthy Foods:** - Electrolytes powder - spring water - herbal teas with no caffeine
