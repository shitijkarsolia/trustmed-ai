===============================================================================

I went to take my amlodipine and I usually just toss it into some food im having (it upsets my stomach if I dont) and it was very chalky and dissolving. Is this okay? My pharmacy isnt open at this time to ask. Most of what I can see says it'll be fine but I did accidentally double dose yesterday and im not sure if that can affect it at all.
