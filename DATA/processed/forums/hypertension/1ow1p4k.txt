===============================================================================

I'm 68. I had a triple bypass 2 years ago, and hadn't seen another cardiologist for almost the same amount of time. I've been taking all 3 blood pressure pills for the last 6 years. Prior it was Atenolol and Lisinopril. I didn't take Losartan, it was added 1 year ago, and Lisinopril was removed. . . I've had a constant dull headache, been dizzy, stuffy nose, itchy everywhere the whole time. Now my hair has thinned so much I can see my scalp. Lisinopril caused me to have a dry cough, but now I have a phlegmy cough and I believe it is the Amlodipine. Also a low back pain and stiff joints. My PCP doctor doesn't listen to anything I say. He just sits in front of his laptop, and occasionally looks up at me. His nurse checks my blood pressure, weight, and temperature when I arrive. That's it. This town is small and has a shortage of doctors. I'm starting to worry about dying because I'm not being heard.

2. u/see_blue [score=0, created=2025-11-13T08:46:51]: I’d be crushing this with a plant-based, low saturated fat, nutrient-rich diet, and including a lot of aerobic and some weight-bearing exercise. Walk EVERY day, a lot… Assuming you’re on statins? I’d also, get my weight on the low side of normal. While you’re describing some possible side-effects, you’re also describing what I’d call malaise induced aging fr a sedentary lifestyle and or lousy diet, and poor metabolic health. But, I’m no doctor, just a guy on the internet w bits of info. I’d see a new cardio doc and maybe a nutritionist. Or find other aging folks or a buddy who are really tuned into improving their health-span through diet and exercise.
