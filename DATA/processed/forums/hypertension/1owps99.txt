===============================================================================

Recently I had some very high readings in my doctors office, and she sent me for a 24hr BP monitor test since she suspected medical anxiety was a factor. Results came back: Day time average 136/84 std 11/6 Night time average 119/71 std 8/5 Doctor said I could try lowering it with medication now, or if I prefer to wait a few months and try to lower it with lifestyle that's OK too. For context: I'm male 42, 6ft, 165 lbs, eat pretty healthy already, and i've always been pretty active. High BP does run in my Dads side of the family and he's been on meds for 25 years, as was his mother. My main symptom is that I often get lightheaded while walking (but not while swimming or cycling or resting). What would you do?

2. u/Individual-Charge-23 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T03:05:42]: I wouldn't get to worried, definitely not need to take meds, but try adding flexseed meal to your diet 20gr per day, also isometric excersize a few times per day if you want to try lowering it without drugs.

If it's high, work on lowering it! How's your caffeine intake, do you drink enough water, do you drink alcohol, and How's your sleep? You don't need to lower it by much at all, so little changes should help, if you have any improvements you can make. In the UK and much of the world, doctors would be fine with your average, and wouldn't consider putting you on meds for them, but you don't want it to get much higher as you get older, so worth seeing if you can make a difference at this point!
