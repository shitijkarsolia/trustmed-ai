===============================================================================

I was previously on 25mg Losartan for about 2 years, then I went off because my BP was very steady and I had lost a lot of weight and was exercising. Then, I got put on antidepressants last year and gain 50lbs back this year. I was feeling kinda funky the other day so I used my home BP monitor and got a 3 average of 117/83. I was like wow! That's awesome! Yesterday was my son's birthday party, and I went stupid with the pizza and ate like 6 friggen slices from Dominos. I had a very stressful, unrestful night, and woke up feeling lightheaded and dissociative. My heart rate was lower than usual, pulse ox said my o2 was fine, then did another BP: First number was like 160/100, then after a few did it again and it lowered, but still averaging 150/95+ I've been back on Losartan for a couple days now, but I missed yesterday. So I guess the questions are - Can a really bad meal cause these numbers today? Did the crummy sleep contribute to it? Is it rebound hypertension from a missed day? How did I get perfect numbers 2 days ago and now it's so much higher?

3. u/RED-coat23 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T21:14:42]: I assume it is mainly rebound from missing the losartan. I used to get a spike if I missed my Telmisartan pill by 5 minutes! Telmisartan must have a short half-life.
