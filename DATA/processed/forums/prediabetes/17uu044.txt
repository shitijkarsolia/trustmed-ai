As requested, here is our official FAQ. Please help contribute to it by adding your own questions (and answers if you have them) below, or suggesting corrections to my initial contribution. The following FAQ was inspired by content found in this subreddit. I cannot guarantee that it is perfectly medically or grammatically accurate (I tried to diligently research and proofread), so please let me know if you find errors by responding below... don't worry, I am not an egotistical mod, so I am not afraid of being corrected in "public." LOL This took me about 3 hours to build... I'm done for the night! Good health to you all! * **Q. What is pre-diabetes and how does it differ from diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Pre-diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. It differs from diabetes in that it can often be managed and even reversed with lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication, especially when it's not related to weight and lifestyle factors. Without proper management, pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes. Unlike diabetes, pre-diabetes doesn't typically doesn't result in severe health problems often associated with diabetes if managed early and effectively. But if you do become diabetic does it mean that you will suffer from severe health complications? No, NO, NO! Many people with diabetes (type 1 and 2) live full and healthy lives if they manage their illness with proper diligence! Do not listen to the negativity sometimes found in this subreddit, in fact, please flag those messages because they are unhelpful and unwelcome.* * **Q. What does A1C mean and what is the range for pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *A1C is a blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. For pre-diabetes, the A1C range is typically between 5.7% and 6.4%. An A1C level below 5.7% is considered normal, while an A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests \*may\* indicate diabetes. Whenever you have a reading of over 5.x (your physician is best to determine the value of concern), it is important to make changes and get at least 2 A1C readings per year to watch for a trend (staying the same or going up/down).* * **Q. What are the medical indicators that determine if I'm pre-diabetic?*****Answer:*** \*Pre-diabetes is typically diagnosed based on blood sugar levels. Key indicators include an A1C level between 5.7% and 6.4%, 8h fasting blood sugar levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (*5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)*, or an oral glucose tolerance test showing blood sugar levels between 140 and 199 mg/dL (\*7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) *two hours after drinking a sugary drink.* * **Q. Can I be diagnosed with pre-diabetes even if I am not overweight?*****Answer:*** *Yes, while being overweight is a risk factor for pre-diabetes, individuals of any weight can develop it. Other factors like genetics, age, and lifestyle also play a significant role.* * **Q. Does a family history of diabetes increase my risk of pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, having a family history of diabetes can increase your risk of developing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. It's important to share your family medical history with your healthcare provider for an accurate risk assessment.* * **Q. Can children develop pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, children can develop pre-diabetes, although it's less common than in adults. Risk factors for children include being overweight, having a family history of type 2 diabetes, and leading a sedentary lifestyle. It's important for children at risk to undergo regular screenings.* * **Q. Is pre-diabetes reversible, and how can I manage it?*****Answer:*** *Pre-diabetes can often be managed and sometimes reversed with lifestyle changes. This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, medication may also be prescribed.* It's important to add a caveat here... "reversible" simply means that you can certainly get back to a normal A1C, however, you will always need to remain diligent about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. * **Q. Are there any specific diets recommended for managing pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *There's no one-size-fits-all diet for managing pre-diabetes, but a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is generally recommended. If you're overweight, a medically supervised calorie-reduced diet (by way of carefully monitoring your food consumption or going on a \*Optifast program) is almost always the most significant means of mitigating a pre-diabetic condition.Reducing intake of processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats is (almost) always beneficial, regardless of your health.*\* A qualified medical practitioner must authorize Optifast, and it must be purchased directly from Nestlehealthscience; Never purchase it from dishonest Amazon vendors! * **Q. Can physical activity help in managing pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, regular physical activity is a key component in managing pre-diabetes. It can help control blood sugar levels, lose weight, and increase insulin sensitivity. Note: as always, every person is different, and in some cases, physical activity may not be a significant component in managing your blood sugar... please seek proper medical advice.* * **Q. How often should I get tested for diabetes if I have pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Typically, it's recommended to get your blood sugar levels tested at least once a year (my physician checks me every six months) if you have pre-diabetes. However, your doctor may suggest more frequent testing based on your individual health status.* * **Q. Does pre-diabetes always lead to type 2 diabetes*****Answer:*** *No, pre-diabetes does not always progress to type 2 diabetes. With lifestyle changes such as improved diet, increased physical activity, weight loss (if necessary), and/or drug intervention, it's possible to bring blood sugar levels back to a normal range and significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.* * **Q. Are there any specific symptoms that indicate my pre-diabetes is turning into diabetes?*****Answer:*** *While pre-diabetes often has no symptoms, signs that it may be progressing to type 2 diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. As always, any of the above symptoms could be attributable to many different conditions, that is why if you notice any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider.* * **Q. What are the long-term risks of not managing pre-diabetes effectively?*****Answer:*** *If not managed effectively, pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes, which comes with increased (not guaranteed) risks of heart disease, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve damage. The greater the A1C reading, the greater the health risks.* &amp;#x200B; * **Q. Can stress affect my pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, stress can affect blood sugar levels and make managing pre-diabetes more challenging. It's important to find effective stress-management techniques.* &amp;#x200B; * **Q. I just tested my blood sugar level and I am concerned, it was \[x\] reading... am I in trouble / diabetic / pre-diabetic?*****Answer:*** *This might be one of the most frequent type of questions that I see in this subreddit.A single blood sugar reading is generally not enough to determine if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic. To diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes, healthcare professionals rely on a series of tests, including fasting blood sugar levels, A1C tests, and oral glucose tolerance tests, which give a more comprehensive view of your blood sugar regulation over time.*Now, let's talk about that reading... C*onsumer blood glucose meters, the kind you might use at home, have a variable accuracy range, often around 20%. This means two readings taken close together can show different results within this accuracy range. Additionally, blood sugar levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day based on diet, physical activity, stress, and other factors, so one reading is just a snapshot of your blood sugar level at a specific moment and only within a 20% range of its true value. While home glucose meters are valuable tools for monitoring individuals already diagnosed with diabetes, particularly to avoid dangerous blood sugar extremes, they are not very useful as standalone diagnostic tools for those who haven't been diagnosed with diabetes type 1 or 2. If you are concerned about your blood sugar reading, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider for proper testing and guidance.* Reference: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505415/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505415/) &amp;#x200B; * **Q. Can I give or ask for medical advice in this subreddit?*****Answer:*** *It is not advisable to give or seek medical advice in this subreddit. While sharing experiences and information is encouraged, medical advice should always come from a qualified healthcare professional who understands your specific condition. Discussions here can provide support and share general knowledge, but they are not a substitute for professional medical consultation. If your medical-like advice is compelling and relevant to the thread, I kindly request you add a disclaimer that one should always consult their own healthcare advisor...For any medical-like advice, my answer is... please proceed with caution and always consult a healthcare provider for personal medical concerns.* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

2. u/usafmd [score=15, created=2023-11-14T12:38:07]: Quite a bit here, I have enough time for the 1st paragraph: \*\*Q. What is pre-diabetes and how does it differ from diabetes?\*\*Answer: Pre-diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. The American ADA has a significantly lower cutoff for the diagnosis compared to the WHO, which has declined to adopt the lowered threshold suggested by the ADA over a decade ago. Prediabetes, with difficulty, can be distinguished from hyperglycemia, Metabolic Syndrome and other states with elevated glucose. For example, hyperglycemia may occur due to physiologic states that raise glucose but not predispose one to diabetes. Most, but not all prediabetes is due to persistent Insulin Resistance (IR) when found with Metabolic Syndrome. In this case, the risk of Prediabetes is not simply the subsequent risk of diabetes, but hyperlipidemia. Sometimes prediabetes is caused by a poorly secreting pancreas or incretins of the intestine. Prediabetes arising from IR is on a disease continuum with diabetes, in spite of a sharp numeric cutoff. The theoretical inflection point of diabetes occurs when even extremely high insulin levels are unable to suppress post meal fluctuations of glucose. Both can be managed and even reversed with lifestyle changes but with increasing difficulty with the passage of time. Body composition, the ratio of visceral fat to lean body mass (muscle) has been found to be pivotal for most cases of prediabetes. Prediabetes/diabetes cutoff was historically created with a small number of study patients noted to have an increased number of visibly damaged blood vessels in the back of the eye. Even though hyperglycemia is the most commonly measured index for prediabetes and diabetes, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation contribute to the disease course.
3. u/usafmd [score=10, created=2023-11-16T19:21:01]: \*\*Q. Does a family history of diabetes increase my risk of pre-diabetes?\*\*Answer: Yes, but it's important to remember that Type 2 diabetes was a rare disease in the early 1900's. Lifestyle, norms surrounding exercise and eating habits are learned from your family and contribute more that genetics. The World Health Organization reports that the number of persons with diabetes nearly quadrupled from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. This change far exceeds what can be attributed to genetics, as DNA changes on a much slower time scale. Sharing your family history of diabetes tells your doctor more about your family's lifestyle than genetics.
4. u/usafmd [score=7, created=2023-11-16T09:37:15]: \*\*Q. Can I be diagnosed with pre-diabetes even if I am not overweight?\*\*Answer: Yes, while being overweight is a risk factor for pre-diabetes, many other factors place one at risk for future diabetes. The road to diabetes is complex and involves multiple defects: damage to cell structures by sugars, chronic inflammation, β-cell failure (decreased insulin secretion); insulin resistance in muscle, brain, and liver; increased glucagon secretion in pancreatic α-cells; increased lipolysis in adipose tissue; incretin deficiency and resistance in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; and increased glucose reabsorption in the kidney. \[DeFronzo RA: Banting lecture: From the triumvirate to the ominous octet: a new paradigm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes 58:773–795, 2009\] The body's composition, i.e. fat-to-muscle ratio and how that fat is distributed (adjacent-to internal organs and inside individual cells), as well as frequency of cycling to fat depletion/repletion (before oxidization can take place) are stronger determinants of prediabetes, and in a wider scope, Metabolic Syndrome (the mishandling of fats and carbohydrates in the body) that place one at risk of future disease complications. Lean or Thin Prediabetics often have fat around kidneys and inside their liver cells (Fatty Liver). A subset of thin prediabetics, but large number come from countries where their mothers experienced a protein-poor diet during pregnancy followed by a highly processed, high-calorie, high carbohydrate, low-fiber diet prior to adulthood. \[Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2022 Jul;18(7):413-432. doi: 10.1038/s41574-022-00669-4. Epub 2022 May 4.\] Finally, there is a group who can be thought of as "diabetes"-lite, who are genetically in the bin of monogenic diabetes. These people can look like prediabetes for a short or long period of time spanning decades who have problems producing insulin. They may or may not have antibodies.

6. u/usafmd [score=5, created=2023-11-15T20:59:18]: What are the medical indicators that determine if I'm pre-diabetic?\*\*Answer: \*Pre-diabetes is typically diagnosed based directly using blood sugar levels or indirectly, with the Hemoglobin A1c. Key indicators include an A1C level between 5.7% and 6.4%, overnight fasting blood sugar (FBS) results from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L), or an oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) showing 2-hour blood sugar levels between 140 and 199 mg/dL (\*7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) after drinking a sugary drink. The FBS is considered a measure of the liver's ability to regulate blood glucose during a fasting state. When combined with measurement of insulin levels, a measure of the liver's IR can be calculated with the HOMA-IR calculator. Only in the US, and those adopting the ADA standard, 100 mg/dL is the lower cutoff. The World Health Organization has steadfastly held 110 mg/dL to be the prediabetic cutoff. Therefore it is possible to be prediabetic in one part of the world, but not elsewhere. The FBS test demonstrates marked physiologic, daily variation. Not uncommonly, poor sleep, activity prior to blood draw, vigorous exercise and illness can elevate the result. The 2-hr GTT is considered the most predictive of future diabetes risk. The inability of insulin to tamp down glucose levels by 120 minutes reflects poor insulin secreting ability, or pancreatic exhaustion. The 2-hour test involves prolonged testing with multiple blood draws. For this reason, the A1c has gained favor as the most convenient screening test. When the GTT is coupled with simultaneous insulin measurements, the Matsuda Index can be calculated, a measurement of whole body insulin resistance. The GTT is a more reliable and reproducible test. However very low carbohydrate and keto diets will adversely affect the outcome of the results. The sugar content in the drink and timing differs between screening tests used during pregnancy and the standard GTT. Approximately one-third of prediabetics will be positive by one of these tests. With worsening metabolism, the other tests will become positive over time. Many who make diet and lifestyle changes experience no worsening or even improvement in later years.
7. u/No_Relative444 [score=4, created=2024-02-21T21:37:46]: Can you add an FAQ for the names and tests to ask your doctor for?
8. u/usafmd [score=3, created=2023-11-14T18:49:59]: Edit for: **What does A1C mean and what is the range for pre-diabetes?**\*\*Answer: Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that corresponds to average blood sugar levels over the preceding three months. According to the ADA, for prediabetes, the A1C range falls between 5.7% and 6.4%. An A1c level below 5.7% is considered normal, while an A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests \*may\* indicate diabetes. While two general A1c tests are approved by the FDA, only one type is certified for rendering a diabetic diagnosis. Since the percentage reflects the percentage of Hemoglobin A which has sugar attachment, (glycation), the test is: 1) a stand-in proxy for average glucose values; 2) is subject to variability which prolong or decrease red cell survival; and 3) dependent upon normal, stable hemoglobin and glycation rates. Average CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) values do not exactly correspond to A1c equivalents for a variety of technical reasons. Hemoglobin A1c has replaced the Fasting blood sugar (FBS), and 2-hour glucose tolerance test for ease of testing. Oftentimes it is possible to be positive early-on for prediabetes by one but not the other two tests. These tests measure different aspects of the body's ability to handle glucose. The Gold Standard remains the 2-hour Glucose Tolerance Test, especially the 2-hour value after a 75 gram dextrose challenge. Whenever you have a reading of over 5.x (your physician is best to determine the value of concern), it is important to make lifestyle changes and get successive A1c tests spaced six months apart to establish trending (staying the same or going up/down).
