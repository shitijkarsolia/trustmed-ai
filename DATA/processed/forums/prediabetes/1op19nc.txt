===============================================================================

So I went through a weight loss journey last year and also picked up intermittent fasting as compared to the stringent calorie tracking that helped me lose all the weight last year. The reason I picked up intermittent fasting was because I felt eating throughout the day would just leave me hungrier than if I just fasted throughout. I also felt that I could compromise and eat whatever I wanted since I felt there was no way to eat in one meal what most others would throughout the day. I am just at a loss because I exercise daily through Muay Thai training and pickleball, and fasting all day through dinner. Now I am unsure as to what else I could possibly do since I feel I’ve done everything right.

Focus on nutrient dense foods with healthy fats, lean proteins, lots and lots of veggies, and some fruit (especially berries). and I highly recommend eating three meals at reasonable times during the day. You can still fast for 12 or 14 hours or so between dinner and breakfast; but clearly what you are doing is not working well for you - and is not realistically sustainable for the long term. What may have helped you lose weight - and congrats on that btw, that’s a huge accomplishment! - is not necessarily going to be the same approach as what is conducive to good health and maintaining a healthy weight going forward.

3. u/emi_lgr [score=9, created=2025-11-05T09:01:17]: Unfortunately weight loss isn’t always the answer, and intermittent fasting doesn’t work for everyone, especially if you do anything longer than 16+8. The “eating whatever you want” in one large meal is probably what’s working against you. Whatever you’re eating during that one meal is probably putting a lot of strain on your blood sugar management system and so is not having food for the rest of the day. I have a BMI of 19.8 and still have insulin resistance. I can’t really cut more carbs without risking more weight loss, but I’ve swapped most refined carbs for complex ones and eat most of them during the day. I don’t eat after dinner but I also don’t fast longer than 16 hours. If I want a treat, I eat it before exercise to minimize blood sugar impact. My A1c dropped from 5.8 to 5.3 in four months, but it’s clear I still have insulin resistance and work to do. This isn’t a diet for me, it’s a lifestyle.
4. u/Parking-Track-7151 [score=6, created=2025-11-05T08:11:56]: I don’t think intermittent fasting is good for A1c.
5. u/BlissCrafter [score=4, created=2025-11-05T09:53:50]: Get your iron checked. The kind of dieting you describe often leads to some nutritional deficiencies. Low iron will cause your hba1c to read high even if your blood sugar is fine.
6. u/kind_ness [score=4, created=2025-11-05T22:11:40]: Here is the thing. A1C is very unreliable metric. It can have false positives and false negatives due to other issues not related to glucose, for example iron deficiency etc. Modern endocrinology slowly moving towards A1C calculated based on CGM data, which can give more than just one number but also immediately show your glucose spikes in relation to different kinds of food and lifestyle modifications. Very actionable. So I’d say get a CGM and see what A1C it calculates after two weeks of usage.
7. u/philouthea [score=3, created=2025-11-05T11:52:14]: I think it would be helpful to get a blood glucose monitor (they're pretty cheap) and prick yourself 1 h after your meals to see where you stand. If your blood sugar is not excessively elevated (which I can imagine) maybe the answer is in your folate deficiency like others have mentioned. Try to monitor for a week. If your post meal blood sugar is indeed high then there's your answer. The monitor is a helpful tool for making small adjustments in the diet without going extreme (like cutting out all rice, lol I could never)

9. u/baugofbones [score=2, created=2025-11-05T19:57:45]: You have to keep in mind that when your on a weigh loss momentum or phase, what your doing is manipulating your metabolism your essentially lowering or slowing down your metabolism through calorie restriction. 50lbs is a huge accomplishment and you forsure set yourself up for the long rum by doing that and also by way of cardio like muay thai n pickleball, the strategy now from the 50lbs weight loss is to bring back up the metabolism but strategically because now (or then) you have a slow metabolism meaning you have a smaller amount of food you can eat before you stuff the metabolic mechanism that turns food/fuel into energy, when you stuff that mechanism you leave food/fuel sitting around waiting its turn because the machine is slow right now which looks like high blood sugar/trigs.
10. u/cocoapuff19 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T04:10:24]: Surprisingly intermittent fasting isn’t recommended by diabetes nutritionists. I was surprised too! They actually recommend you eat a few carbs but not like white rice and such but low GI carbs such as sweet potato, lentils etc. the weight you lost was amazing and you’re doing awesome. Just need a few tweaks :)
11. u/Nitr0x78 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T06:38:02]: You’re doing a lot of cardio, you need to lift. You also need a CGM to monitor how often you overshoot 140, as your diet will f you over easily no matter how strict you think you are since we are all built differently.
12. u/Sweaty-Mortgage892 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T10:01:41]: Strength training! Add muscle to burn glucose. Also, you commented that you eat mostly rice and beans and dessert. You probably need to ditch that and replace with more meat protein and low carb vegetables. What you're eating, even though once a day, is overwhelming to your body. I would say if that creates a positive change you might be able to add a small amount of what you like every once in awhile. Maybe. Some people just have to work harder and sacrifice more than others. You might be that person. Good luck to you.
13. u/TX2BK [score=2, created=2025-11-05T05:22:07]: You can eat 100% carbs and still lose weight as long as calories in is less than calories out, but that can cause your A1C to go up. What’s your diet like?
14. u/hashpot666 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T09:21:33]: Weight loss isn't the only thing that helps. What you eat is also important, along with good sleep, etc. We're all here because we all have some sort of insulin resistance, etc. and many factors are involved. Honestly, talking to other people including my doctor, I think we're still nowhere near knowing everything that goes into this. Just keep working on it. You've already done a significant amount of hard work, just take the next steps.
15. u/baugofbones [score=1, created=2025-11-05T20:00:32]: Do you drink alcohol? Also keep in mind being fatigued can be conducive to insulin resistance so i know training muaythai is can make it a challenge to manage fatigue especially when your on a weight loss mission
16. u/AlternativeHealth461 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T09:02:40]: Are you female? Research shows women need to break their fasts or cortisol will spike and signal fat storage. I had to give up longer fasting on time restricted eating—I was just losing muscle. My FB is higher now until I rebuild my muscles.
17. u/Affenzoo [score=1, created=2025-11-08T11:07:59]: Although many people think so, A1C is not the holy grale. Use your fingerprick for some weeks during the day and draw a graph or buy a CGM (does the graph for you). If your readings are ok then, you're good. Don't rely only on A1C.
