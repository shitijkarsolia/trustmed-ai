===============================================================================

Hi guys, I just found out from my doctor yesterday that I'm pre-diabetic and of course have been going through the spiral of "oh god, what do I do??" Luckily I have a supportive partner and have found some resources, including this subreddit. I'm looking for some guidance around the upcoming holidays, as this seems like a difficult time to be trying to reduce/eliminate my sugar intake. There's a lot of things saying a treat once in a while is ok, but I'm kind of clueless as to what "once in a while" really means, how much sugar constitutes a treat, and how much these things will damage/prevent progress. A couple specific questions: 1. My sister bought me 2 advent calendars as gifts. Is 2 candies/chocolates a day for the month of December going to be problematic if I'm otherwise focusing on healthy eating? 2. I usually have a single cup of tea, with milk and sugar, every morning. Do I need to start drinking it black or is this minor enough to be ok? 3. The holidays are going to be non-stop with parties and family gatherings, filled with cookies and such. Do I need to abstain entirely (especially given the advent calendars I mentioned)? If not, how much can I reasonably treat myself and how often, without doing further damage? I totally understand we're not doctors here and I do plan on reaching out to my doctor with questions as well. I'm just looking for people's experiences with these kinds of things and some general knowledge. Thank you kindly!

The biggest foe you’ll have is high fructose corn syrup. Much worse than actual sugar. If you must indulge in sugar, get more activity. Especially exercise that involves the legs like walking and squats. So if you have an advent chocolate back it up with a brisk walk. It’s best to avoid as much sugar as possible obviously
2. u/T22L60A87 [score=6, created=2025-11-05T11:33:35]: 1. If you are otherwise making all excellent dietary choices and getting plenty of exercise, a small bit of DARK chocolate is ok; other chocolate or candy, not really. It’s a bit of a trade off too; if you ditch the rice and bread and potatoes and are eating lots of veggies and lean proteins and healthy fats, a very small chocolate treat after a meal is not going to do harm; but if your diet is less than optimal, it will only compound the issue. 2. Ditch the sugar, try subbing stevia instead. And while it is expensive, subbing pistachio milk for dairy milk has been a real game changer for me recently. 3. The holidays can be tough. You will need to set firm limits for yourself, and de line most sweets/baked goods etc. you can help offset a spike by consuming a spoon of EVOO before allowing yourself an indulgence, but you still need to be selective and make smart choices. And when in doubt, just say no thanks. And save the few treats for the really good stuff. Don’t mindlessly eat a sugar cookie just because it’s there; save the indulgences for something special and more delectable - and then only a small amount. Sure, maybe have a sliver of pumpkin pie after a healthy low-carb meal - or maybe learn to make some keto-friendly desserts (because they won’t have added sugar), etc. And go for a walk after having a treat if possible; don’t just sit around idly. It makes a difference!
3. u/SergeiAndropov [score=5, created=2025-11-05T12:23:24]: I was diagnosed last year after the holidays because I noticed I was having blood sugar swings after eating the numerous delicious desserts that my sister-in-law made. I would focus on eating defensively until you've gotten your A1C under control, lost weight, and gained muscle mass.
4. u/iced_coffee_242 [score=8, created=2025-11-05T11:27:03]: You can eat just about anything if you’re strategic about it. If you’re going to have a cup of tea with milk and sugar, have a high protein high fiber breakfast first. If you’re going to a holiday party and plan to eat sweets, load up on protein and fiber before the party so you eat less once you get there and so you can curb the glucose spike a bit. Plan to walk 15-20 minutes after high carb/sugary meals. Also other habits like weight lifting, staying hydrated, and sleeping well will increase your insulin sensitivity. This isn’t about depriving yourself entirely, it’s about all of these smaller building blocks that add up to bigger change.

6. u/baller_unicorn [score=2, created=2025-11-05T11:51:09]: I think a good first step would be to drop the sugar from your tea and avoiding and sugary drinks. Drinking your sugar is generally one of the worst things and cutting that out can make a big difference. As far as occasional treats, I'm not sure how often is okay but a better way to think of it might be to not allow yourself to consume sweets or carbs alone and to exercise portion control. Try to have a well rounded meal before you have a sweet. That will accomplish two things. One you won't be as hungry and it will be easier to limit your portion of sweets, and two if you consume fats, protein, and fiber with your meal, that will slow down digestion of the carbs and reduce blood sugar spikes. You can also plan to go for a walk after consuming sweets. Don't eat sweets then sit. I think that putting a lot of focus into what you will eat could be helpful. Like making sure you have good high protein snacks around. Watch for hidden sugars in your food.

8. u/nails4u [score=2, created=2025-11-05T15:00:51]: I would highly recommend you wear a CGM, even for a couple of weeks, you’ll see how your food and activity affect your blood sugar. You’ll see patterns and trends which are super helpful and can guide you going forward. If you’re going to have any sweet treats, eat them at the end of a meal, not by themselves. Although I’d suggest you cut out all added sugar.
9. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T03:09:42]: You don’t have to go full-on “no sugar ever” mode, especially early on. It’s more about learning how your body responds and making intentional choices. A few quick tips: * Advent calendars: 2 small chocolates a day isn't the end of the world if your meals are balanced and you're active. Pairing sweets with protein or fat helps blunt the glucose spike. * Tea with sugar: Try cutting the sugar in half first or switching to stevia/monk fruit. Milk is usually fine in small amounts. Best way to pair with roasted nuts. * Holiday parties: You don’t need to abstain, but prioritize protein and fiber at meals, and treat sweets like a side dish, not the main event. Space them out and avoid snacking on them solo. Plan some activities after having food Best way to learn this is using food coach app like glucospike ai app can show different meals affects our body.
10. u/Bryllant [score=1, created=2025-11-05T11:36:43]: It’s the hidden sugars that get you, like milk in coffee. I would donate the candy to a kid and enjoy some frozen grapes, one of my favorite treats. I have learned to enjoy black coffee, I use Starbucks beans, but make it much weaker than I get at a coffee store. I also add three doses of beneFiber in the coffee, which dissolves easily and has no taste. It helps control blood sugar and cholesterol. You will get out of it what you put into it. I F70 A1C 5.6 started exercising, starting slow and now actually have muscles. Muscles will help you burn off glucose. I’m burning glucose while I sleep If I know I have to eat something sweet, start your meal with Salad or veggies and while you are digesting the veggies it will slow the sugar uptake. Your taste buds may change, mine have. I can taste the chemicals in processed food. There is an APP called YUKA that will allow you to check food with bar codes to see how good for you it is, based on a score of 0 to 100. Those Lance Peanut-butter crackers are the worst.
11. u/UtexBirder [score=1, created=2025-11-05T13:42:13]: Smaller portions of things like sweet potatoes helped me. You get used to what 3 ounces looks like instead of the 6 ounces I was eating. For some reason sweet potatoes spike my blood sugar worse than anything.
12. u/SuzMichell [score=1, created=2025-11-05T13:49:36]: There is no information anywhere online that I have found to say how often you can get away with having a treat. Post prandial (after-meal) glucose responses are highly variable between individuals, even when they eat the same foods, according to scientific studies. This is the case for non diabetics as well as diabetics. This variability is influenced by a various factors, including genetics, gut microbiome, lifestyle, and metabolic health. Because of this, personalised diet plans are crucial for managing and preventing blood sugar spikes. The only way to work out a personalised plan is to use a Continuous Glucose Monitor. A new study by Weizmann Institute scientists has found that individual blood sugar levels in response to eating the exact same food vary dramatically. Some people can eat a small bit of dark chocolate after protein &amp; healthy fats, others can’t. Everyone has completely different responses to different foods. Walking/Exercise after eating sugar will not necessarily mean your blood sugar won’t spike badly. It doesn’t with me. Eating EVOO before eating something that spikes blood sugar makes no difference at all to some people, see this short video https://youtube.com/shorts/0uzhEf9ynAM?si=4hLkK4vHRBPN7T_P And a cup of tea with milk and sugar would spike a lot of peoples blood sugar badly even after a high protein breakfast. So would eating sweets or a dessert after protein, fat and fibre. I can’t do it. A lot of the Glucose Goddess hacks don’t work for me. I would advise you follow the advice that’s been given to only have a treat very occasionally. Spiking your blood sugar on a frequent basis as a pre-diabetic can worsen insulin resistance and significantly increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and long-term complications. These complications can include serious damage to the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.

14. u/UtexBirder [score=0, created=2025-11-05T13:39:13]: Dark chocolate in small amounts and learn to drink your tea (and everything) without sugar. I have sugar in my pantry for hummingbirds only. lol
15. u/EggieRowe [score=0, created=2025-11-05T13:59:23]: I'd highly recommend downloading a food tracking app, changing nothing for a week or two, and just faithfully recording what you eat normally now. I'm of the mindset that you need to know where you are right now to figure out where you need to go. Maybe it becomes real obvious that you're eating too much added sugar in a day. Or maybe you're super low on fiber or protein - both keep you full and less likely to snack.
