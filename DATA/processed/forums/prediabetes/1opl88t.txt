Hi all, Brand new here. Yesterday I received a 5.5 a1c, which was the same back in 2023. My curiosity lies in the fact that I do not eat refined/processed sugar, and the only carbs for my intake is rice, due to being in a gluten-free household. Admittedly, white rice is an absolute staple for me, and I've eaten it almost daily for years. I'm also a professional beekeeper, so honey is a frequent visitor of my gut. Aside from that, I literally don't regularly eat any other forms of carbs, sugars, etc... Are these two factors, along with presumed hereditary connection (my father said he thinks his father was pre-diabetic) enough to keep me stuck at 5.5? White rice is REALLY that bad?!

I’ve been her patient for years and have maintained a 5.5 or below ever since wandering higher some years back. If you want to force it lower, you’ll need very low fat % in your body, higher than average muscle mass, watch carbs constantly, exercise daily, and make sure your iron is always normal. Or you could accept 5.5 as perfectly normal and healthy and just maintain a normal body weight, eat healthy foods and exercise as often as you can.

Then it doesn’t spike your glucose as much. Also start your meals with fibre, then protein and fat, then carbs and sugar.

6. u/philouthea [score=1, created=2025-11-07T06:31:24]: If you like your A1C to be lower, I'd say get a simple blood glucose monitor (don't bother with a CGM, not yet) and measure four times a day (fasting, after breakfast/lunch/dinner). Do it for a week and see what the results are. Make adjustments to your diet accordingly. Your average blood sugar (according to your A1C) is around 111 mg/dL and should be reflected in your measurements. Aim for lower spikes post meals :-) don't get a CGM unless you have a lot of money to spend and are OK with false values associated with small blood sugar fluctuations.
