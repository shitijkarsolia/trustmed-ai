===============================================================================

So I've been prediabetic since 2024. I've lowered my A1C from 6.2 to 5.8 as of April 2025. I worry about my nutrition and consumption of food (carbs and sugar) every day, and I know I drive my parents up the wall with it. My anxiety has been very annoying, but I've tried to stop. I was asking what my dad wanted to eat for dinner. I mentioned I was craving a calzone, and my dad stated that "I crave pizza-like things a lot." My dad said he didn't care what I ate, but when I tried to talk to him, he told me I had to make a choice. I could worry about my prediabetes when I buy pasta and eat cookies and chocolate all the time (which is not true), and it's my decision. I saw that he was frustrated. I was also told that I was xx years old, but I had to make choices. He also implied that he didn't want to hear me talk about prediabetes as long as I make decisions (that I suppose don't make sense). It was not an enjoyable conversation. I started to cry, and the conversation did not provide any conversation, or addresing my anxiety and mental health struggles. I have been asked why would I need a dietitian or measure my blood sugar. My doctors are not concerned about my eating habits, and because I live at home, there are rules that I have to follow: I cannot cook until 10:30 am because my stepmom is sleeping, and so I try to not eat ceral or sweets, but it is very hard to eat quiet foods, especially since I work. I could buy my own food, but I don't make enough money for that. So after my dad said those words to me out of frustration, I felt such shame and almost had a panic attack. I feel out of control and don't know what to do. I have heard comments by my dad and adults in my life that "I eat cookies all the time," and "I wouldn't be able to survive without fat and sugar." I know I eat more sweets and carbs than I should, but how do I deal with this sense of pain and shame that I feel? I'm crying as I write this, and I don't know what step I should take next. I am trying to not blame myself. I'm asking for advice and asking if I overreacted.

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious when you're getting mixed messages and struggling with food choices under difficult living circumstances, while also dealing with comments that make you feel judged. Your feelings of shame and being out of control are very real given everything you're experiencing. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these struggles, and it's important to remember that acknowledging these emotions is a significant first step. You're trying your best to take care of yourself, and it's okay to seek support when things feel difficult. Sometimes, finding resources that can help you understand and manage anxiety, including those intense moments where you feel on the verge of a panic attack, can make a big difference in regaining a sense of agency and calm. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, potential causes, coping strategies, and techniques for managing panic attacks, which some people find helpful for gaining perspective and practical tools. It might offer some insights as you figure out your next steps and work towards feeling more in control. God bless.

Take that haters!! You are working. Saving money. Living a healthier lifestyle and making hard changes. Sometimes you need a cookie! As a father, I’m sorry to hear your Dad has made you feel less than. Looks like you’re overcoming a lot. Making the right changes! Much love and respect 🧡🧡🧡🧡

He sees you’re trying but then when he sees you eating foods not ideal for pre diabetics, he worries. Worry sometimes comes across as anger…but it’s worry, in disguise. As far as trying to eat for your pre diabetes, go get the diabetes code by Dr Jason Fung. That will be a good starting point. Walk 10-15 minutes after every meal. Try not to snack. Focus on keeping your insulin levels low. And remember it’s better to go slow and steady, than full on! As far as anxiety goes…try to learn meditation and maybe tai chi. You just need to find the right tools to help the anxiety pass. Good luck!

I think no matter what you just need to find some structure and exercise is probably the biggest needle mover for both your A1c and your anxiety. I’ve tried to build structure through the perfect diet and did low carb high fat for about 2 years really exercising hard after every meal the first few months. Saw initial improvements in A1c but it rebounded and now cholesterol is high. I almost checked myself into a psych ward today actually and I have had multiple breakdowns trying to improve my health markers and it’s taking a huge tole on my mental health. I thrive in routine but I don’t know if this routine is working based on my last labs. I might try high carb low fat diet to try to reverse diabetes to build my tolerance to carbs so I can handle carbs better and lower cholesterol along the way but very scared and don’t know if it will work or make things worse. Nevertheless exercise will help the most especially after eating even if it’s just 15 minutes for medium to high intensity. Sorry for rambling too. But like I said I think if you can find some sort of routine especially around exercising after every meal no matter what kind of meal it is it will help you. Diet is a lever for sure and I sympathize with you and your family and doctor dynamic and am speaking from my experience. Sorry if I’m not helping calm you down I am struggling as well just want you to know you are not alone. Basically if you can’t control your diet you can control your exercise so make some exercise goals. You got this. Love you

If it works for you, you can ease up on worrying about the carbs in starches like pasta and bread, and just stay focused on the sugars and added sugars in sweets and bakery items and all the other places they hide them. You will have to read labels as much as as possible because that stuff is everywhere.
6. u/Rough-Improvement-24 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T09:21:52]: Stress can be as bad as eating carbs for prediabetes. So eat in moderation, increase fruit and vegetables, go for a walk (it doesn't cost money at least) and aim to live as stress free as possible.
7. u/AlternativeHealth461 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T14:00:46]: I’m moved to tears by all these wonderful respondents. Give yourself the same compassion I KNOW you would give a friend. My contribution is to let you know hunger/cravings are very complex, evolutionary biological drives. Its really hard to begin with, and then we add a psychological layer and no wonder we’re a society with metabolic disease and blood sugar problems. We’ve never had this many crappy options and our brains aren’t wired to understand the changes in modern food. For example, a tsp of refined white sugar comes from 2 sugar canes which are over 6 feet tall. Imagine if you had to eat an entire cane of sugar. The stringy fiber would fill your stomach long before you ate the equivalent of a tsp of sugar. Every processed food we eat has had “the brakes” removed. Food order can resolve some of that. Having a salad first, with salty feta and olives, or crunchy nuts and tahini dressing slows down stomach emptying and makes you feel fuller. Salads can be cooked vegetables, lettuces, low sugar fruits. Other brakes can be as simple as some cut up veggies ready-to-go in the frig, or taking a walk, or doing a zen tangle in your room. Just a break from impulsive behavior. Remove judgement. Begin observation. Ask yourself why you feel a certain way before you eat something—(notice I didn’t say, “something bad.”). For some reason, you have connected this food impulse with some emotional feeling—relief, happiness, comfort. it offers something initially. Then you feel badly….Also, It sounds like you don’t live with your biological mom. Is there something there? And hey, you’ve improved your A1c! Under some difficult constraints. Give yourself some grace and recognize shame just creates a cycle of guilt. Your stumbling block is as big as you make it. Don’t give it more power than it deserves. I’ve been there.
