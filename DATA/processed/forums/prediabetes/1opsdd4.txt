Hello Reddit, Just recently, my endocrinologist let me know I am “probably” prediabetic based on the pattern of impaired postprandial glucose (ie, insulin resistance) seen in my mixed meal study. The thing is, on the one hand... during the study in question, which was a controlled mixed meal with a reasonable glycaemic index, my BG peaked at 251 mg/dL. With less balanced meals, I’ve recorded spikes as high as 333. In all cases, the BG remains &gt;200 at 2 hours, even with the high glycaemic index meals, which technically is one of the ways we diagnose full-blown diabetes. On the other hand… my most recent A1C is 4.9% and has ranged from 4.6-5.3% in the 5 or so years I’ve had it tested, which is part of why it has been so difficult to get this issue taken seriously. The other part is that I weigh between 41-42 kg for 159 cms (\~92 pounds for 5’3”) and although I have slightly high body fat % by DXA, the distribution is such that there is only 13% fat mass through the torso (to include metabolically relevant visceral fat) which is extremely low for a female. Based on this, part of me wants to be in denial and/or downplay my condition; however… I don’t think a body can achieve those BG numbers without a certain level of underlying pathology. I suspect the A1C is mostly explained by metformin, which keeps the sugars (and attendant reactive hypoglycaemia) under control no matter what I seem to eat, and the diet I follow most of the time is lower in carb anyway due to malabsorption issues. But, the minute I stop the metformin and have a sandwich like a normal people… high 200’s if not 300+. :( Altogether it makes me wonder just how far along the disease pathway am I really, with this level of insulin resistance ? More importantly, for any of you who have reached this stage of blood sugar dysregulation and subsequently improved, did you ever get to a point where you could eat a sandwich, unmedicated, and maintain something approaching normoglycaemia ? What did that take if so ? Sorry for the long post. I am just feeling a bit stuck in having to face the reality of dealing with this but am scared it will continue to progress over time (I‘m &lt;40) and “lose weight to make it better” isn’t an option either.

2. u/SuzMichell [score=3, created=2025-11-06T08:38:53]: See this American Diabetes Association Publication below which states the following: A1C is a poor indicator of what occurs in the postprandial (post-meal) state. A1C captures only chronic hyperglycemia (persistently high blood glucose levels over a long period), but it will miss acute hyperglycemia (sudden, severe rises in blood sugar levels after eating) Diabetes diagnosis based on A1C misses a large proportion of asymptomatic early cases of diabetes that can only be identified by the OGTT. According to a recent Chinese study, A1C sensitivity is inferior compared with fasting blood glucose at the population level (19). Also, people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), in whom the efficacy of diabetes prevention has been unequivocally proven (20), cannot be detected by A1C. Because high glucose is toxic and causes many types of tissue damage, any indicator of hyperglycemia is predictive of diabetes complications. https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/Supplement_2/S184/28282/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Diagnosing-Diabetes-With-A1C

The hba1c numbers don’t seem believable if you’re hitting 300 glucose. That’s just kinda wild. It’s good you have an involved endocrinologist because you definitely don’t fit the mold. I’m assuming you don’t have an ED? That’s the one thing I could think of but still.
4. u/Earesth99 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T07:52:09]: You take a diabetes medication. That means the test trails don’t imply you are not diabetic, regardless of tge results. Taking medication doesn’t make the fysease go away. The goal is to simply control the fluctuations in blood glucose to reduce the damage.
5. u/ARandomMutant [score=1, created=2025-11-06T12:55:26]: Thank you for comments. They are a helpful reality check that I really do need to be proactive in doing something about this. Nobody (i.e., my physicians, even most of my family) seems to take it seriously and it’s made me wonder if I’m just being paranoid. Thanks.
6. u/CapriKitzinger [score=1, created=2025-11-06T17:43:48]: Hey sista!! You and I sound related. I was kinda hoping to win the highest post meal glucose award but you have me beat. Lol!! I am the exact same build as you. 5ft 3in and 98lbs. I’m 43. My A1C is about 5.7-5.4. Couple of things: have you been tested for LADA? Have you been tested for Type 3c??????? Nobody knows about this!! Are you of German heritage by chance? Have you been checked out for dumping syndrome? Don’t let them tell you that if you don’t have diarrhea then you’re fine. You can have rapid gastric emptying from the stomach and first parts of digestion. Lastly, how’s your testosterone levels? How much bulky muscle do you have? Try this: get a personal trainer and bulk up 10lbs of muscle. I’ll join you. It’s the last thing for me to try. I’ve been taking 15mg Actos and 250mg of Metformin 3x a day. I feel freaking amazing. No more aches and pains. No more inflammation. I’m gonna bulk up with muscle and then I’ll try going off the meds. My Dexa scan said I had an “athletic” build sooooooo, I’m not too hopeful. I have 22% total fat which I think is normal for a woman?
7. u/CapriKitzinger [score=1, created=2025-11-07T12:06:22]: Definitely a mystery sometimes. I asked about German heritage it’s because I’m ancestrally from Germanic heritage. I saw that genetically they can be predisposed to T3c with no prior surgery or cancers of the pancreas. I haven’t gone down the rabbit hole of getting my post meal insulin patterns checked. I have to follow up with my doc.
8. u/aeseline [score=1, created=2025-11-07T18:09:07]: Curious because I am similar - have you tried increasing muscle mass? I started metformin recently. Similar age, no considerable risk factors but bg hitting nearly 300 with a good challenge. I recently started weight lifting too and wondering how much I can hope for by increasing muscle. What is your metformin dose? I am titrating up. 112 lbs, 5’7”. Thanks!
