===============================================================================

I wore a CGM last year. Often had a biphasic response after meals where there’d be a spike, then dip below or to my fasting levels then spike again. During the dip and spike usually having a headache and tiredness. Highest in a day would typically be 12 (216 mg/dl), this is if I have carb heavy meal or sweet treat. on one occasion was 14-16. Hba1c 5%. I’m Fiji Indian, so there is lots of famine in my blood lol. At night time I’d wake up with alerts that my BGL is between 3-4 (54 - 72)

Normal is up to 7.8mmol 2 hours after eating. Above that but below 11 is prediabetes. A Multicentre study showed that healthy peoples blood sugar is between 70mg/dL &amp; 120mg/dL (3.9 &amp; 6.7 mmol) 90% of the time. The median time between 70 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L) was 96% . Between 124mg/dL to 140mg/dL (6.9 to 7.8 mmol) was only 4 - 9% of the time, depending on age. See this American Diabetes Association Publication which states that because high glucose is toxic and causes many types of tissue damage, any indicator of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) is predictive of diabetes complications. https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/Supplement_2/S184/28282/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Diagnosing-Diabetes-With-A1C See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109707034444?via%3Dihub In this publication from the American Journal of Cardiology, it says that exaggerated post-meal spikes in blood glucose and lipids when repeated multiple times daily eventually lead to atherosclerotic risk factors and CAD (Coronary Artery Disease). At only 80 mg/dl = 4.4 mmol/L the Cardiovascular (CV) risk of post-meal elevated blood sugar starts to increase. By 140 mg/dl = 7.8 mmol/L, the point at which we traditionally only begin to classify patients as glucose intolerant or pre-diabetic, the risk is already increased by 58% There are other health risks also from blood sugar spikes. I would recommend continuing to use a CGM to identify which foods spike your blood sugar the least, and try and keep your blood sugar as low as possible. Exercise is also important eg a walk after eating. Resistance exercise is meant to improve glycemic control by increasing muscle glucose uptake, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and boosting metabolism. Weights or resistance bands.

That biphasic pattern can be common with high-carb or refined carb meals, especially in people with South Asian backgrounds since we tend to have more insulin sensitivity changes. Try slowing the spike with protein or fiber first, or smaller carb portions spread out it can help reduce those fatigue moments too.

But one thing I'd be doing is trying to eat more healthy.. less rice and stuff less bread and carbs. From what I can tell, you've probably eaten something that has made your blood sugars go "hey that ain't too bad! Let's have some more!" But your insulin couldn't keep up with it. I'd be getting an insulin test to see if you have insulin resistance as well. Your blood sugars especially when you've had a spike are the tell tale sign of you've had something not healthy to eat for dinner. (This is only a guestimate based on someone without insulin resistance because someone with insulin resistance may get a spike in blood sugar from eating relative ly healthy things.) What did you eat before going to bed that night?
