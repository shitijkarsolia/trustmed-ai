1. u/IamRetrogirl [score=18, created=2025-11-06T06:39:28]: I suggest adding avocado. I typically have egg and avocado for breakfast and sometimes add a sausage.
2. u/Chellanthe [score=7, created=2025-11-06T07:20:34]: If you are concerned about carbs, my bread choice is usually a keto bread. I like the lewis brand. Zero net carbs. However if it doesn't work for you, occasionally a slice of Ezekiel bread isn't the end of the world.
3. u/Sufficient_Beach_445 [score=8, created=2025-11-06T08:25:17]: Whole eggs. Otherwise i would not change a thing.
4. u/KornikEV [score=8, created=2025-11-06T08:09:49]: drop the bread if you can? bread + raspberries + peanut butter is a carb bomb.
5. u/Mametbet [score=3, created=2025-11-06T10:00:50]: I'd say your diet looks perfect except may be too much saturated fat still and the carbs were a bit high too. Replace half the sausage with avocado. Only use raspberry as garnishment really. But it is fine as is. Just ensure you walk 30min after.
6. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=4, created=2025-11-06T07:41:53]: If you're serious about lowering blood sugar, you have to ditch the bread (Ezekiel still has a fair amount of carbs). And eating only egg whites? The yolk has about 90% of the nutrition in an egg and is very bio-available. Whole eggs have nearly everything humans need for complete nutrition. My breakfasts (never have until noon) are only eggs and meat.
7. u/binahbabe [score=2, created=2025-11-06T07:39:12]: Add a side salad and some veggies in your eggs
8. u/CrimsonCrabs [score=2, created=2025-11-06T09:39:33]: Replace the toast with vegetables...and watch a video on how to make eggs. Those are going to give you hella farts.
9. u/baugofbones [score=5, created=2025-11-06T07:25:55]: The peanut butter and sausages
10. u/Defiant-Bed-8301 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T07:59:20]: Did you log the sausage correctly? I ask because they tend to have a lot of saturated fat. Thats the item I would eliminate. But, this is coming from a cholesterol lowering perspective not a glucose perspective.
11. u/Colleen2112 [score=4, created=2025-11-06T06:26:48]: Not so much what you eat, but the order. Fibre first puts a “net” in your belly, taking the rest of the food slower to digest and keeping you fuller longer. So yeah, get that spinach. Then eat the protein, then carbs. If you don’t need the raspberries, I’d maybe skip, they’ll raise your blood sugar. But if you want them, then eat them last. It all looks good to me.
12. u/Puzzleheaded_Dog8328 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T07:12:45]: Add some fruits and veggies
13. u/Annual_Test860 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T07:25:17]: I would add more protein source. I try and get 30 grams of protein first thing in the AM. I would also some veggies or something, maybe mix your eggs with some mushrooms and spinach. As for the bread, one slice of Ezekiel is like 16 grams of carbs? That’s not too bad especially if there’s a good amount of protein there
14. u/tryingtoloseweight12 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T06:29:12]: What's making the carb intake so high? It's still pretty high.
15. u/Elizabitch4848 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T07:42:26]: Produce
16. u/usafmd [score=1, created=2025-11-06T07:59:08]: Bran cereal at ALDI
17. u/realmozzarella22 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T15:07:36]: Depends on what you eat for the other meals.
