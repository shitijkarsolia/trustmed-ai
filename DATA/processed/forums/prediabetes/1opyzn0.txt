===============================================================================

I’m a woman in my 30s with a BMI around 19. My doctor isn’t concerned about my blood test results, but I’m left feeling unsure whether I’m being overly worried or if his lack of guidance is an issue. Test Results: Spring 2025: A1C 5.4, Fasting Glucose 6.7 Summer 2025: Fasting Glucose 7 (A1C not tested). I had significant stress and a panic attack the night before this test, which may have affected the result. Fall 2025: A1C 5.1, Fasting Glucose 6.1 Between these tests, I made significant diet and lifestyle changes. From spring to summer, I eliminated soda and limited chips and candy. From summer to fall, I cut out almost all processed sugars and carb-heavy foods, essentially eating as if I were diabetic. I also made sure to walk after meals and exercise 3-5 times a week. I’ve shared my concerns with my doctor, especially given my family history (mom is pre-diabetic, great-grandmother had type 2 diabetes), and expressed my interest in trying for a baby soon. However, my doctor didn’t seem concerned and, when I received my latest blood work results, he simply noted that my fasting glucose was near normal, with no further advice or testing. Despite my efforts, I’m still struggling with my fasting glucose remaining only slightly above normal. I feel like something isn’t quite right, and I’m frustrated by the lack of guidance. With the holidays approaching, I want to enjoy treats without compromising my health, but I spend a lot of time worrying about what I can eat, ensuring I exercise after meals, and feeling guilty when I indulge in sweets. I’m considering another appointment with my dr to discuss the results, but given that the last one was unhelpful and access to doctors in my area is limited, I’m not sure if it’s worth my time. I’m looking for advice from others who’ve been in similar situations—how do you approach managing your diet and lifestyle, and how did you get your doctor to take your concerns more seriously? Are there additional tests I should ask for, like a 2-hour glucose test or something else? Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

You can do an OGTT or LPIR if you want to verify your a1c or get a more accurate measure of IR or verify your a1c. I have family history as well (and all the associated genes) and I'll do a yearly LPIR since my a1c will be in normal ranges. Unfortunately most doctors won't do too much digging beyond a1c. But to be fair, generally a1c will catch most cases of insulin resistance. Don't worry about the holidays. Your health isn't going to implode if you enjoy yourself every once in a while. IR doesn't develop overnight.

Just a good habit to have.... Going for a walk after eating does wonders for your blood sugars. It doesn't even have to be a long one. Just the habit of physical activity, even minor, after eating is a small way to improve IR concerns, spikes, and fasting glucose numbers. I know that's not what you asked, but I do think it's never a bad time to make small changes to improve overall health.
