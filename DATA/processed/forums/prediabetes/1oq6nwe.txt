===============================================================================

Hi all! I am 24F, 5’6” 250lbs, just recently diagnosed prediabetic with 5.9 A1C, slightly high LDL, slightly low HDL. I am definitely sedentary due to my job but my doctor recommended at least 150 minutes of exercise per week. Diet is my biggest problem though - I eat lots of processed foods and sugar, especially right now as I’ve been struggling with depression and ADHD and have low energy for cooking and exercise. I was wondering if I need to go scorched earth and start eating a super strict diet or if I can start by incorporating more fish, greens, etc. into my existing diet? Today I had some Siggi’s yogurt with strawberries, walnuts, and chia seeds for breakfast, and for lunch I had an apple and celery with peanut butter, some carrots, and more walnuts. But I’m still super hungry! 😭 And I have my partners birthday dinner and a bonfire this weekend where I know lots of unhealthy food will likely be present. I’m waiting to get an appointment set up with a dietitian but in the meantime, can I eat some sugar and carbs here and there or do I need to cut it out completely? Thanks!

I had to see nourishing my body verses taking away. I had to find ways to cook even if I was tired and didn't want to. I would come up with a list of foods that aren't hard to make. Right now you need to make sure you are eating more. Focus on getting more protein not just from nuts and peanut butter but eggs, chicken, tuna in moderation other forms of meat or protein products. I focus on veggies at most meals then eating protein then eating fats and carbs in that order. If you are going to have dessert eat it right after dinner and then do calf raises of go for a short walk it can help with the spikes. Eat half the dessert and don't let it become and everyday thing. I know ADHD can cause all or nothing thinking but I would work on that. If you eat one cookie you dont have to freak out and sabatoge. I stopped labeling food as good or bad. I stopped placing so much value on food. I started really small with excercise and worked my way up slowly. Had to find what works for me. Try to not be rigid and take small steps often. Do t jump into restriction causes more issues especially with insulin issues and even leads to binging. I can't do low carb doesn't work for me. Some people get continuous glucose monitors which shows what food spikes you. They aren't through insurance though. It's a lot and can be overwhelming. Start small and find what works for you. There is a lot of noise and I had to be mindful about not becoming obsessive.
