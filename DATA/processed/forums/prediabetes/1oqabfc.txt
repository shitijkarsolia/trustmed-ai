Guys, I'm low-income Brazilian, my AC1 in September was 6.1. I'm scared, because I felt like I didn't treat myself correctly because of money and I have to get treatment in November (will there be time?). I need help, what should I do? (Should I take tests to check insulin and others?). In addition to having autism and tag. My plan is as follows: follow up at the health center, see a nutritionist and walk for 30 minutes. In addition to sleeping well, controlling mental health, etc. But I'm losing weight, I was 59 and now I'm 67 and 1.82, I need you to help me. I don't work, how should I treat pre-diabetes with few resources? They had been pre-diabetic since 2022, but I didn't know (I found out recently), and I found out now in 2025. What's more, I had depression and I didn't eat or drink water for a few days, which could have caused the insulin to become stronger. In my situation, what should I do?

Your plan sounds solid walking, eating regularly, managing stress, and following up at your health center will already help a lot. Try not to worry too much about November one step at a time. You’re already doing more than you think.
