===============================================================================

Person A finds out they have an A1C of 6.2 and is told they’re prediabetic. They cut down carbs/sugar exercise more and within a year their A1C dropped to 5.5. They’ve “reversed” prediabetes Person B finds out they have an A1C of 6.5. They also change their diet, exercise more and drop their A1C to 5.5 but because they crossed the threshold they’re a lifelong type 2 diabetic who is in remission. What exactly did person A reverse that person B did not and never will for the rest of their life? It’s not like person A can immediately start eating pop tarts and ramen noodles every other day. Both person A and B have to continue a certain lifestyle and closely monitor their sugar intake or they’re both at risk of getting to diabetic levels again. Sounds like remission for both A and B to me. I say all of this because I’m person A and when I told my husband that I reversed my prediabetes he goes “oh so you’re cured and can eat like a normal person again”. Mind you, this man has a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast literally every morning, eats pad Thai once a week and eats pizza with French fries with our kids every Friday. His vigorous workout routine consist of walking the dog and his once a week Mens league softball game that’s always followed by a few beers with the team he also LOVES Reese’s peanut butter cups. He gets blood work done yearly and has never had an A1C higher than 5.2 😡 Even if I didn’t have a carb for literally 5 years if I ate like him for 6 months I would almost certainly develop type 2 diabetes. I’ll always be at risk and never be able to eat like people like him So what exactly did I reverse? I still have to eat differently than the rest of my family probably forever. Sorry this is mostly just a rant and maybe I’m just playing semantics with the word “reverse” but to me it really seems like once you get prediabetes you can never be like you were before. You have to create a new normal or else it comes back again. That sounds like a life long remission to me because there are people out there like my husband who can mostly eat whatever they want and be fine. End rant

2. u/Earesth99 [score=47, created=2025-11-07T09:06:41]: You need to remain vigilant just as if you were diagnosed as diabetic. I went into remission by adding muscle and getting very lean. That worked for a decade and I simply didn’t think about diabetes. Then the pandemic came and the gyms closed. I lost muscle and am at a normal bmi but my blood glucose popped up. I’m on two meds and pre-diabetic.
3. u/TeaMaster569 [score=14, created=2025-11-07T09:10:40]: I feel you. I would just love to go out for Thai and have a big plate of rice and green curry! That said, I have been in 5.5 for about 6 months and I find that my spikes are less severe. It took me years of abuse to be prediabetic so I’m assuming it’ll take a while where I can relax a bit. Still, I’m seeing small improvements. I also think it depends on how you reduce your AIC. If it is just keto, it will go back up as soon as you eat carbs again. Within the past year I have worked on strength training and building muscle. I’ve done a satisfactory job here though lm not a gym rat by any means. So, this may drive the improved spikes. I find also if I reducing saturated fats, my body is more forgiving of carbohydrates. I have read research that saturated fats clogs your cells so they can’t take up as much glucose and so it stays in your system. My thought that right now I need to give my pancreas time to rest. Either by food or having muscles do more of the lifting. The fewer spikes, the more rest. And then it may not be 100% but it will be better.
4. u/Jade_Star23 [score=17, created=2025-11-07T09:41:09]: I've been researching this and it seems nuanced. If you get your A1c into healthy ranges, have a healthy weight and increase muscle mass, lose visceral fat, you are not longer prediabetic and you have improved insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin resistance etc. Your body will probably tolerate carbs better, but if you went back to eating just like you did before, what made you prediabetic, you will most certainly go back to being prediabetic. That means lifelong changes still but not necessarily no carbs ever. Eating like you described isnt just bad for glucose, its bad for your health overall and will decrease longevity and hurt other health outcomes. So I wouldn't say its a remission if you were never actually diabetic, but you will absolutely need to stay active and eat healthier forever.

6. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=14, created=2025-11-07T09:36:43]: That’s a great point! From what I’ve read, ‘reversal’ is often used as a marketing term, but medically it’s more like remission; since the risk is always there if habits slip. Calling it remission instead of reversal makes sense because we still need to be vigilant with our lifestyle.
7. u/Mametbet [score=26, created=2025-11-07T08:45:34]: I view the whole pre diabetes thing as a car with worn breaks. If you drive slowly, you can be okay but if you speed or hit a down slope, you will quickly find out your breaks are broken. I am not sure we can eat normal unless we cure our pancreas. Do we know how to cure our pancreas?
8. u/sciencenerd75 [score=29, created=2025-11-07T08:36:53]: I honestly have the same question because I’m in the same boat as you. I have A1c of 6.1 and I have reversed it before to 5.6 but as soon as I got somewhat lax with my diet I went right back up very quickly. It seems like the correct word for prediabetes and diabetes is “remission”. You will always have to eat the way you did when you reversed the A1c. Once you have insulin resistance you always do. Sigh… My husband eats carbs all day long and has always had a normal A1c! I feel your frustration. It sucks
9. u/Specialist_One538 [score=7, created=2025-11-07T11:35:40]: Sometimes when I read posts like yours I truly wonder about the numbers some people on this sub have (fasting, postprandial and not A1C) and what their diet used to look like before the diagnosis. That being said, it infuriates me to know that a lot of people probably end up with T2 just because they’re being told that they supposedly reversed their pre diabetes. Reversed to me means I could theoretically eat garbage without moving afterwards, without meds, without eating in the right order etc. and not go above 140. Or in other words, I wouldn’t consider myself “cured” as long as I don’t pass the glucose test. Shout out to my husband who only peaked at 111 after eating a whole bowl of rice, potatoes and 100g of Kelloggs Tresor in one sitting! It’s frustrating and it sucks…
10. u/You_are_the_Castle [score=7, created=2025-11-07T11:49:22]: You've staved off a problem that most people face and, as you age, you have to stick to your diet to ensure you don't slip back into the red zone. So, yes, this is a lifelong commitment to doing everything possible to stay away from full-blown diabetes.
11. u/SpecialistGear4931 [score=13, created=2025-11-07T15:07:01]: You cannot eat normally again. I reversed my prediabetes, but I relaxed my diet a little bit over a vacation and I am already seeing the old signs again. You can never go back to eating bagels and what not ever again. Sorry to deliver bad news. You will always have to be vigilant. The good thing is, if you are vigilant, you will not develop diabetes.
12. u/Sufficient_Beach_445 [score=6, created=2025-11-07T10:23:02]: Prediabetes isnt really a disease state so much as insulin resistance is. And there seems to be evidence that insulin resistance can be reversed. But will insulin resistance come back if u go back to eating a lot of sugar? Probably.
13. u/CapriKitzinger [score=6, created=2025-11-07T10:24:30]: I prefer the word masked as opposed to reversed or in remission. Once something is broken along the glucose metabolic chain, there is very low likelihood of repair. I get frustrated when people say diabetes is lifestyle related. I don’t believe so as much anymore. I think we need to look into what comes first, the chicken or the egg. If you look at how beta cells are formed, you’ll find it very interesting. You are born with all the beta cells that you will ever have. They replenish themselves in a different way than our other cells. I’ve done a lot of research and it really seems like we’re in the infancy of recognizing the different types of type two diabetes. I do believe that some are exposure related. Similar to radiation exposure causing cancer. What if the exposure to glyphosate in our diet is what’s responsible for creating damage to the B cells and therefore causing metabolic dysfunction? What if exposure to viruses damages the beta cells and causes metabolic dysfunction? What if exposure to vaccines as a child causes damage to your beta cells, and therefore metabolic dysfunction. Have we examined thoroughly the exposures that could be responsible for damaging the beta cells? We are 100% behind the curve (pun intended) when it comes to early monitoring. We know that post meal glucose spiking is the first sign of metabolic dysfunction. Order a Stelo CGM online and stick one on your hubby. He could be spiking to an insane number post meal, then followed by an insane dump of insulin. This will not show up on A1C. It’s so rapid that it doesn’t collect in the blood. BUT!!! That wave of insulin eventually taxes the beta cells, and that’s when you start seeing resistance. The glucose metabolic chain is sooo complex. Have you heard of Type 3c???? Neither had I. Look it up. Medicine needs to do a better job identifying what exactly along the chain is broken. Is it always the beta cells? End rant. 🤣
14. u/Croissant1967 [score=4, created=2025-11-07T15:12:01]: So far; I lost 40 lbs by doing intermittent fasting, walking every day, cutting all sweets, eliminating refined carbs and mealy potatoes. Doing my bloodwork again soon. My A1C was 6.4. Let's see what I will find out!
15. u/usafmd [score=3, created=2025-11-07T13:47:20]: This is very hard to understand, but the pre-diabetes category is imperfect, and the test for screening are imperfect. There are many people who receive this diagnosis who are never at risk for diabetes, and there are people who have insulin resistance who never received the diagnosis of pre-diabetes. As one other poster said, prediabetes is not a disease, however, insulin resistance is a disease state. In the same way, obesity and inadequate exercise as well as eating the SAD diet is not normal and abnormal physiologic states of health.
16. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=3, created=2025-11-07T15:07:34]: Diabetes can not be reversed as in cured but can be reversed as in remission. People often misunderstand the term to mean when the numbers go back to "normal". The right term is remission. The other thing is, you can enjoy bagel, pad thai, pizzas too; I do. I was 8.5+ A1c and 7 years later I am at 4.3. It does take dedication to build muscles which act as supplemental glucose stores. You can actually eat carbs to sustain the glycogen reserves.
17. u/lauvan26 [score=3, created=2025-11-07T19:57:49]: I’ve been prediabetic at least 4x since my 20s. I’ve been on Metformin since I was 26. Every time i decided to eat a bunch of carbs consistently over period of a month or more my A1C starts going up, my insulin levels gets very high and my reactive hypoglycemia gets more severe. There was one time I tried an experiment on myself by exercising 5x a week including 3x strength training but inconsistently taking Metformin and eating 150+ of carbs a day. By the end of 3 months, I was pre-diabetic again🙃. I had to accept that I have to eat like Im diabetic most of time.
18. u/Zealousideal-One8010 [score=4, created=2025-11-07T08:43:46]: oh boy, i feel your frustration! my partner is the exact same!! it is really annoying! i so much look at a sweet and my number rises. i think there are a lot of smarter people on this sub with way more knowledge than me, but i would say the different between person A and B is the amount of damage that’s been done due to the high blood sugar. Once person B crossed over into that range and hung out there for a bit, there’s likely more damage to the body that person A received. I think that’s why it would be considered reversed vs remission. I do agree with you - it’s more like prediabetes in remission too as if you went back to what you were doing before you’d end up in the same place.
19. u/myorangeOlinMarkIV [score=2, created=2025-11-08T14:51:49]: It took me about 1 year to take my 6.0 down to 5.5. I consider my prediabetes a permanent condition that is not going away but now is managed. That is how I define it. My diet is strict and planned with a small treat once in a while. Yes I can sometimes grumble to myself when my son bakes and orders pizza but there is no way I will let this become diabetes.
20. u/Lemonbar19 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T21:14:13]: Thank you for this post. I feel your pain. And I feel like we are all kind of screwed and in remission but cautious.
21. u/MutedShock8385 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T22:39:20]: Diabetes remission is a tricky subject. My last to A1C’s have been 5.0, but I wouldn’t put myself in the remission category. They still have my on insulin, though I keep pressing them to remove that. I also know that if I deviate much from my current diet, my numbers will soar. I have a lot more work ahead to improve insulin resistance. I’ve taken about 130 lbs off, but I still need to get my cells to be more insulin sensitive before I’d consider myself in remission, and even then, if I were to go back to the junk food I used to regularly eat, I’d start the diabetes progression over, and it would likely happen faster.
22. u/SexySkinnyBitch [score=2, created=2025-11-10T14:39:39]: Agreed. In some cases, it is truly reversible, but for most of us, the best we can hope for is remission or keeping it from progressing too fast. It always annoys me when people claim to have "reversed" it, when they probably are just in remission or denial.
