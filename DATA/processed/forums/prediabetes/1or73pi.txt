Hello guys 😇 So, a few months ago I went to the doctor for an infection and I had my blood drawn. Fasting glucose was 106. Checked my A1C the next day and it was 5.3 Ignored the problem and thought that it was because of the infection. This month I have been suffering from severe anxiety which triggered my health anxiety as well so I started measuring my morning glucose: first day 88, second day 93.. third day(I measured3 hours after waking up but without any food) and it was 106. Measured also after a very big meal and it was153 after and hour and a half and 142 close to the 2 hours point. I self diagnosed with prediabetes using chat gpt Decided to eliminate all carbs, 5 days go by and with average 20 net carbs- today I went below 8 net carbs - had almonds with peanut butter for breakfast and then salmon with mayo (which ate at 5 pm). Now (11 pm) stared feeling a lot bit tired(not dizzy just tired) blood sugar was 72. Is this normal?? Is this a sign of hypoglycaemia? Prediabetes? Please help me

When you drop carbs suddenly, your glycogen runs out and your body hasn’t fully switched to burning fat yet, so you end up feeling tired or a little off. That doesn’t mean you’re hypoglycemic or diabetic, it’s just your metabolism adjusting. If you’re not shaky or sweating, you’re fine. Also, low carb isn’t always the magic fix. A lot of people cut carbs and then replace them with too much saturated fat, which can actually make insulin resistance worse for some people. Diets very high in butter, cheese, or fatty meats can reduce insulin sensitivity and make blood sugar harder to control long-term. What really helps is focusing on balance — include lean protein, healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, nuts, and fish, and don’t completely remove complex carbs like lentils, oats, or quinoa. These foods help keep blood sugar stable without the crash. Try easing into lower carb instead of cutting everything overnight. Add a few slow carbs like lentils, quinoa, or veggies, drink enough water, and make sure you’re getting your electrolytes. Your blood sugar will likely even out once your body adapts. If your sugar ever drops below 65 or you start feeling shaky or lightheaded, have a small carb snack and keep an eye on it.

Your body’s likely shifting into fat-burning (ketosis), which can feel like low energy. Going super low carb (under 10g) can also mess with electrolytes like sodium and potassium, making you feel off. When you reintroduce carbs after extreme restriction, your insulin response can spike harder, which can worsen insulin resistance short term. So take it slow. No need for extremes. Focus on quality carbs like lentils, berries, non-starchy veggies, and pair them with protein and fat. Track how your body responds using something like food coach app - glucospike ai. It helps you adjust without the guesswork or going full keto.
