===============================================================================

Hi all, glad this group is around. Thought I'd just share some stuff about my journey and hoping that I am on the right path. I'm 38 m, was diagnosed with prediabetes (6.7!). I'm pretty active; well, the activeness went down a bit due to injury. Long story short, I had knee surgery, and before that, they had to run some blood work. And that's where they detected that I was prediabetic. If it weren't for my knee surgery, I probably would have done blood work waaay later. My doctor offered me metformin or to immediately change my diet. I decided to change my diet first. Anywho, I kinda disregarded it (changing my diet) post surgery, with the ego that "meh. I'm still 38, I'm prediabetic. I can still eat like crap." About two months ago, I felt extremely fatigued. I was eating a breakfast burger and felt tired. And so I thought I needed coffee; therefore, I had Vietnamese coffee (I'm sure some of you know, that thing is like crack lol). The weird thing is that I IMMEDIATELY passed out after having vietnamese coffee. Usually, I'd be up for hours and hours with that thing. That's when I knew something was off. Since then, I made changes. The big one was that I immediately stopped drinking lattes, and went for black coffee instead/chaggachino (tastes good and doesn't spike up my glucose). I have a Stelo as well, so I've been watching closely what seems to be spiking my glucose, etc. I mainly drink just water now. If I'm drinking alcohol, it would be hard liquor or a seltzer. I've cut down rice (this was a bit tough being Filipino lol), and increased my protein even more so. I've also increased my physical activity since surgery, which should help. The biggest win so far is that I lost 13 pounds literally in a month (from 181 to 168). That's great and all, but I'm really more focused on getting my glucose down. I'm planning on getting bloodwork done at the end of the year and I'm hoping for better results. I'm noticing several threads here about reversing prediabetes, etc., and I, too, am now trying to understand it a bit better. It seems like once I reverse prediabetes (and I hope I will), I can't just revert to my old ways. And this can be a huge challenge for many of us, especially if our loved ones are eating whatever they want, with no repercussions. But I'm also learning to accept that hey, maybe I shouldn't revert back to my old ways anyway, as it's just going to impact my health (beyond diabetes). I presume that yes, I can eventually have some cheat days here and there, but it just can't be like the old days. And this is even when I fully reverse prediabetes. Anyway, I wanted to say hello, and I love the support in this group. I hope i'm in the right track. Would love to hear any advice from any of you! My avg glucose has been at 120 but has now dropped to 110. I'd love for it to be in the 90's.
