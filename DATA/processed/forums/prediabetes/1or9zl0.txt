===============================================================================

I ate dinner 2 hours and I tested my blood sugar 1 hour after eating. It came back at 168 so I waited until the 2 hour mark to check it again. It was higher than an hour earlier. I haven't eating anything else so I can't understand how it could go up instead of down. I'm new to tracking blood sugar so I'm still trying to figure out how to manage it. Any ideas on why it would increase at the 2 hour mark?
