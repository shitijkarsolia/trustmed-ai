===============================================================================

very happy with my latest test result. I also lost about 60 lbs during this time. I focused on proportions on my plate, and did not completely eliminate carbs, just had less and replaced with whole grains. The past couple months, I have fallen off my exercise routine and was worried that it would impact my progress but I am continuing to lose weight. I even have dessert every night! (Frozen berries or grapes, drizzilicious, or sugar free pudding)

I understand this required a lot of consistency. I was also tracking macros. On top of that, I learned which foods would spike my glucose using the glucospike ai app without a cgm and, of course, took post-meal walks. Additionally, I avoided snacking. If I want to have something, I would wait at least 90 minutes before eating. With these changes, I was able to move my A1C from 5.7 to 5.4 and then to 5.1.
