===============================================================================

Hi everyone I am a college student in DC working on a project about how people with pre-diabetes manage sugar cravings and what they look for in sweet snacks for one of my health and innovation classes. I put together a quick 3–4 minute anonymous survey to understand what people actually want, avoid, or miss when it comes to desserts. There’s a brief mention of a product concept I’m studying, but the survey is mainly about your experiences and preferences. If you’re open to it, I’m also looking to do a few short 10–15 minute chats with people who have dealt with pre-diabetes or sugar-craving challenges. Hearing real experiences would help make the research much stronger. This is totally optional — no pressure at all. Thanks so much for taking the time. Your input genuinely matters for this project.
