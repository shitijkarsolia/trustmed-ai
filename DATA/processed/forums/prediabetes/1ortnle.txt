===============================================================================

Would appreciate suggestions or advice on things that helped you lower A1C! I’ve been pre-diabetic for 5+ years. I do have an endocrinologist, but am surprised he’s not concerned about this. 40 y/o F, diagnosed with Graves Disease but its currently under control with meds, active lifestyle (cardio/weights 6x week), healthy weight (not that BMI means a ton, but BMI of 20.4), eats mostly healthy (whole foods, fruits/veggies, lean protein) most of the time. I’ve been cutting back on carbs, eating more lean protein, cutting down on sugar and snacking… I did recently had a baby, so my sleep has been mediocre and 2025 has been a stressful year in general. Lifestyle suggestions? Questions I should be asking either Primary Care Physician or endocrinologist? Meal/snack ideas to stay full, longer? (I am always hungry - partially from the Graves, partially because I’m a bottomless pit). Thanks!

I watched it 12 years ago, and reversed my prediabetes by cutting out sugar. it wont work for everyone - some people respond worse to sugar than others, but it worked for me and I have met many others who it has worked for.

I’d definitely avoid snacking. Eating more protein at meals should help with that. I, too, was a bottomless pit but cutting simple carbs helped a lot. Focusing on protein &amp; healthy fats seem to dull my appetite.

Grave’s Disease is associated with a variety of auto antibodies of which the one pertinent to prediabetes is IGF-1. Insulin like Growth factor. This is a hormone which mimics the effect of insulin. You need to see a specialist, possibly a rheumatologist in addition to an endocrinologist. Be careful when asking for advice among those who don’t do this for a living.
4. u/LuxuriousToast [score=1, created=2025-11-08T15:27:24]: Echoing others that prioritizing seeing an endocrinologist would be ideal. I am 40, have had two pregnancies with gestational diabetes, genetic predisposition to T2, and have hypothyroidism. After my second pregnancy I had an A1C of 6.0, and it was not well managed with diet and life style. I was eating 30-50g of carb a day, active (lift, run, pilates, bike) every day, and lower end BMI (19, but I am Asian and our BMI to manage T2 diabetes scale is slightly different due to our genetic predisposition). As a result, my endo put me on metformin. I also wear a CGM to manage my blood sugar. I can’t eat more than 15g of carb at a time or I spike unfortunately, and it’s far less manageable than when I had gestational diabetes twice. From wearing the CGM and controlling spikes I brought my A1C down from April to October, it now being 5.6. TLDR, endocrinologist was able to talk to me about my entire history. For some of us, medication is the only way. Maybe an endocrinologist can give you some more personalized guidance. Good luck!

Long hours aren’t realistic at this stage, so I just take short naps when I can and add in some NSDR. It’s not perfect, but that’s okay. The constant hunger and overeating feeling is often just hormones doing their thing. I started tracking with the Glucospike AI app, which is a meal spike predictor, to see if the food I’m about to eat will give steady energy without a crash. Pairing fiber with healthy fats has helped, and even a short walk after meals makes a difference. And honestly, just playing with the baby is the best stress relief.
