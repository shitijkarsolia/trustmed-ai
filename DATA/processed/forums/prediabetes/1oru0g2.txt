Just out of curiosity, did anyone get diagnosed with prediabetes/diabetes from an oral glucose tolerance test? If so, what were your results? Most of the diagnosis I hear were from A1C tests. I was diagnosed with prediabetes after having an oral glucose tolerance test in May 2024. My 2-hour reading at the time was 10.1mmol and an A1C of 6.0%. Fasting level was 5.1. Since then I have been restricting carbs and doing a modest amount of exercise every week. I am very lean to begin with, having a BMI of 17.7. My A1C throughout the whole time remain elevated at 5.6-6.1%. Disappointed was an understatement and I was at the point of breaking down. I’ve tried wearing cgm for a month and I was consistently getting readings of 8-10mmol at the 2 hour mark. I’ve confirmed this with finger pricks. In fact they only return to baseline after 3-4 hours. During this time my carb intake was around 90g a day max and I always eat in the correct order too: fibre-protein-carb. So last month my endo sent me for another OGTT to figure out what’s going on. I’ve been told to increase my carb intake to 150g a day for at least 3 days prior to the OGTT to avoid false positives, and the result took me by surprise. I was so sure my 1-hour reading would be above 13mmol.. but A1C was 5.9%, 1-hour reading at 9.1mmol and 2-hour at 6.3. How is this possible?! I did a finger prick when I got home straight after the test and it was 8.3. My house was only 5 mins away. I don’t get it. I’m pretty sure I’m not in remission because every ounce of carb spikes me like crazy.

Carbs….corn…..through the roof. Also, my peak is at 45minutes. If they never test at 45 minutes, they miss a huge window. The OGTT test is a VERY outdated way of measuring. Reading every 10 or so minutes is a must. And these OGTT tests are pointless now that we have CGMs.
