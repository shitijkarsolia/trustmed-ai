How high does your glucose spike to after meals? If you are wearing a CGM what does your graph look like? I am trying to figure out what is normal and what is not normal. Thanks!

2. u/Unlikely_List_6285 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T02:21:30]: I’ve been tracking my post-meal spikes with a CGM, and it really depends on the meal simple carbs can push me up more than I’d expect, whereas meals with protein/fiber tend to be much steadier. My graph usually shows a small rise and then a gradual return to baseline over a couple of hours. I use NJAP patches with my sensors, which makes it easier to wear the CGM consistently and see the trends without fuss. Everyone’s response is a bit different, so it’s useful to track and see what’s typical for you.

If you’re just curious which foods or combos usually cause spikes, you can check out the glucospike ai app, I don’t use a CGM anymore myself. I mainly use it to track which meals make my glucose go up.
4. u/Mcoop87 [score=1, created=2025-11-08T19:12:20]: So I have spiked over 200 my A1C is 5.7 … I actually was up to 284 a couple days ago. But then I had a day with lower spikes.
5. u/sciencenerd75 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T01:30:40]: Mine usually spikes anywhere from 150 to 180 depending on the meal. I’ve seen spikes up to 225 in the past but not too often. I have A1c of 6.1. It takes about 3 hrs for mine to go back to level it was before the spike. It usually begins going down at about 2 hrs after. I know mine is not “normal” because I believe if you have good insulin sensitivity you see the spike go down to normal after 2 hrs and the spike shouldn’t go much above 140 from what I’ve read. Although I believe even people with normal A1c have spikes that go over 140 sometimes.
6. u/NoWafer8435 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:51:22]: This is what i am trying to figure out as well. What is a normal spike? and does the significance of this reading lie on the duration of the spike? I set my range to 130mg/dl and **IF** I eat reasonably I can stay just below 130. If I eat sushi bake, cheesy, garlic pesto bread, or a beautiful carne asada burrito with all the fixings; then i can almost guarantee that I will hit 150+, but will get back to baseline (below 130) within the next hour or so. My doctor says that she does not recommend a CGM for prediabetes because it is not required. Anyone else get push back from their primary about using a CGM?
