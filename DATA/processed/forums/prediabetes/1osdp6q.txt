===============================================================================

I got diagnosed a week ago. My A1c reading was a 6.0. After I got diagnosed, I tried to find resources on what lifestyle changes I can make that are feasible as a university student (since fruits &amp; veg are hard to attain regularly there), and Im just LOST! How did you guys start? I know nothing about following diets or counting calories...

Gym exercise a few times per week and ensure this includes building muscle as well as cardio. 45 minute walking per day. Stay active after meals. Reduce carbs and stick to non processed…..try and stay off rice, pasta and bread. Plants with every meal, eat them first, followed by protein and then carbs. Stay off carbs at least three hours before bed. Fruit after eating. Make red meat, alcohol, chocolate etc a treat not everyday. Keep hydrated. If budget allows psyllium husk (Metamucil if you want it to taste ok) before each meal. Intermittent fast for 14 to 16 hours a few times each week. Don’t stress. Your body is just saying “you’re overworking me, give me a bit of support and rest”. If you ignore all the advice on here don’t ignore building muscle. It’s your glucose eater. Or staying hydrated as it helps you get rid. You’ll be fine.

When I first started, I focused on small, manageable changes rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. For example, keeping healthy snacks on hand, tracking what I eat, and monitoring my readings closely. I also use NJAP patches with my sensors, which helps me keep an eye on my glucose without too much extra stress. Don’t worry about knowing everything at once; taking it step by step is the way to go.
3. u/ctbdp02 [score=6, created=2025-11-09T02:37:59]: First : don't panic! 6.0 isn't really dangerous right now. Better diet more exercise better sleep are usually enough to address some of those problems ... Follow up with your endocrinologist each 3 months and follow his advice!
4. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=4, created=2025-11-09T04:19:56]: Totally get it, starting out feels overwhelming, especially on a student budget. You don’t need to go all in on strict diets or calorie counting to bring that A1c down from 6.0. Start simple. Focus on eating more protein and fiber with every meal to blunt glucose spikes. Cheap options like eggs, canned tuna, lentils, steal cut oats, and frozen veggies work well. Swap sugary snacks for things like Greek yogurt, boiled eggs, or nuts. Walking 10 to 15 minutes after meals helps a lot too. You don’t need to count calories, just keep an eye on how certain meals affect your energy and hunger levels. Apps like Glucospike AI can help track meals and show what spikes your glucose without needing a CGM. Small consistent changes go further than trying to be perfect.

The first most important thing you need to remember besides food, is resistance training to build your muscles. Whey protein isolate is one of the main ingredients to keep your protein goals happening when you’re at the university. Next, you can always buy frozen vegetable vegetables that can be cooked easily. Instant pot has a 3 quart and a 4 quart variety which proves to be very essential to do all the cooking in one tiny equipment. There’s no need to follow any special diet, just remember to eliminate saturated fats and stick to lean proteins and complex carbs. If you need help with the recipes, etc., feel free to reach out to me. Also, my comments are wide open, so look up the rest of the comments I have made in the past. Maybe you’ll find some answer there as well.

This is what I did ...Went low carb, low fat diet (carbs from plant food mainly for breakfast and dinners, other carbs like rice or bread for lunch) Small meal portions for dinner. Larger portions for breakfast or lunch I used the Glucose Goddess method with eating always fiber first, then protein and carbs. (You can find her on YouTube or her books to buy) If unable to grab fiber at meals, substitute with benefiber in a glass of water before a meal. (Suggested by my dietitian) I also cut out all processed foods and added sugars. It didnt show much change in the first 2 months. So I started walking 20 to 30 minutes outdoors daily and lifting small weights 4 days a week. Was 227 lbs and came down to 204 lbs. Also did 16:8 intermittent fasting for 2 months continuously, this helped me lose weight more steady and fast. Its different for everyone. But never stress. Sleep for 6 to 8 hours daily too. (Sleep management is crucial too) These are what worked for me. I am not an expert. You can always choose what meals or life style works for you. This is a matter of lifestyle correction and I am sure you can bring down your glucose levels in no time. Stay strong, you got this!
7. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=4, created=2025-11-09T01:13:03]: You don't need to count calories. Fruits are probably unhealthy for you. Vegetables are healthy, but have little to do with high blood sugar. Excellent starting point: Dr. Jason Fung. (A real, practicing, physician.) He has books and blogs, but you can watch a few of his videos on youtube to get the gist of it. The remedy is not complicated, but requires a permanent change to your "normal" eating patterns. In brief: don't eat constantly, don't snack, eat fewer carbs, eat only within a restricted window of the day, don't eat within several hours of going to bed. For more of the same, videos by Dr. Satchin Panda, at the Salk Institute. Fung and Panda are ALL you need. And you don't need to spend a cent. (You'll save on food, in fact.)
8. u/nerdKween [score=1, created=2025-11-09T12:14:58]: There's a good book by a dietician called the Pre-Diabetes workbook that gives advice on different ways to manage your diet, and they're pretty doable. I found my copy on thrift books for like $6. I highly suggest it.
