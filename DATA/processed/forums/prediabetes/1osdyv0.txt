Anyone who is on metformin 500mg once a day and was/is not very strict with diet and eating but has gotten good results? My endo said just eat in moderation, balanced meals

I’ve seen people do well on 500 mg Metformin just by focusing on balanced meals and not over-restricting. Everyone’s body responds differently, but moderation really can make a big difference 💪.
