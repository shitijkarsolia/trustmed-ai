Your A1c and insulin are still in a good range, but that elevated fasting glucose suggests your body’s starting to struggle with glucose clearance overnight. Keep tracking your food to spot if you’re regularly eating high-spiking meals. You probably don’t need a CGM at this stage. Spike predictor like Glucospike ai can help you log meals and see patterns in what’s causing spikes. Follow these steps and you should start seeing improvements: 1. Prioritize protein and fiber at every meal 2. Walk 10–15 minutes after meals, especially dinner 3. Cut down on refined carbs and liquid sugars 4. Get consistent sleep and manage stress

If you can not afford a CGM, get a basic finger tester. It sounds like your overnight numbers are one of your key concerns. My recommendation would be testing before bed, (if you have a snack before bed, test an hour after eating and if you are still awake, two hours after eating), when you wake up before getting out of bed, an hour later, and two hours later. There are hormonal changes when you wake up that will increase your blood glucose. This will help you to see what type of effect that has on you specifically. This combination of testing times will also help you to see how what you are eating is affecting your morning glucose levels. (You can cut back on testing times based on the trends you notice.) You can also test during the day to see the effect of various foods. Test before eating, one hour after eating, and two hours after eating. (If you are not close to the starting number at 2 hours, test again at 3 hours.) Some things to experiment with: - Small low carb, high protein &amp; fiber snack before bed: Casien (not whey) protien powder chia seed pudding is a good option. Broccoli with mozzerella and cottage cheese is another good option. - Stop eating for the day between 4pm and 6pm - Stretch out eating times. Set a timer after eating a meal for when you will eat again to limit snacks. (3 to 8 hours) - Short duration low to moderate intensity exercise before bed (exercise helps regulate your glucose for hours after. So this time targets your overnight and morning glucose.) Just ten or fifteen minutes is fine. This doesn't need to be a big thing. - Move your workout or add a workout to the afternoon/evening. (Any intensity is fine. Studies show that afternoon and evening workouts have more affect on fasting glucose than morning workouts. If you can only work out in the morning, exercising is still more helpful than not. Do not ditch your work out.) Generally good options that help: - No or limited caloric drinks. So, no sugar with your coffee. No juice. No smoothies. You can also try modifying your drinks to be less caloric. You could mix Ollipop with sparkling water for instance, so that you started with a lower sugar drink and then cut the sugar in half again. - Taper your carbs, more in the morning and less at night. Think 30g carbs or less for a meal and 15g for a snack as a starting place. You may need more or less based on activity levels. - More fiber - More low carb veggies - Low carb veggies with every meal - No "naked" carbs. Eat in order: Fiber, protein, fat, carbs. Do not have carbs by themselves. - Protein and fiber in every meal - Portion controlled carbs (preferably high fiber like raspberries). - More and better sleep. Go to bed earlier. - Lower stress (I know, easier said than done...) - Walk/mild exercise after eating
