Hi: 70F and slight build not over weight. I exercise regularly and eat healthy for the most part. Sometimes my blood sugar will just to 200 an hour after eating and usually go down to 120 after two hours. My issue is that I feel so fatigued after I eat I actually need to lay down as I am my brain is so foggy and tired. Been to Dr. they say A1C and fasting is fine. Is this normal to be so tired after eating a normal healthy meal.

Blood insuline is a simple test. You should have them do glucose and insulin on the same blood sample, first thing in the morning before you've eaten anything. Optimal fasting insulin is under 8 (some say 5, some say 10). Mine is 22.7, so I'm working on that. Don't be fooled by the wide "normal" range. Normal does not equal good. Once you have a fasting glucose and a fasting insulin number, you can plug them into a free online HOMA-IR calculator that will give you your HOMA-IR score. Anything about 2.9 is significant insulin resistance. You'd like it to be 1 or lower. Mine is 4.8, so I'm working on lowering my insulin resistance. High fasting insulin and a high HOMA-IR score would indicate insulin resistance, and that could be your problem. But there are 6 other things it could be. Read: [https://kresserinstitute.com/postprandial-somnolence-why-a-food-coma-happens/](https://kresserinstitute.com/postprandial-somnolence-why-a-food-coma-happens/)Good luck. It's a definite, well-studied symptom pattern and deserves to be taken seriously by your doctors. Don't let them ignore it. There are serious consequences to some of the things it could be.

It may be another cause of fatigue, of which there are many. The sugar spike to 200 doesn’t mean much without telling us what you ate before that (even a person with a great pancreas and insulin sensitivity could see spikes like that if they eat a very carb heavy meal and then sit down after).
3. u/NotDiabeticDad [score=2, created=2025-11-09T13:11:16]: There is the HOMA-IR test but it gets criticism. Still worth researching and seeing if you can get it done. It may give you some earlier indicator.
4. u/benemla [score=2, created=2025-11-09T16:38:56]: This is me - I am prediabetic based on an oral glucose tolerance test only. My a1c is 5.0 and fasting is usually 80s or 90s. You could ask about having the OGTT done if you want! But I agree with others that there could be other reasons for fatigue after eating.
5. u/Dependent-Act231 [score=2, created=2025-11-09T17:02:35]: Yes to your first question, no to your second.
6. u/emi_lgr [score=2, created=2025-11-10T00:54:31]: Yes, you can. I have insulin resistance with a normal A1c and fasting glucose, but only because I’m careful with how I eat and time my exercise for maximum benefit. Have you tried eating less carb-heavy meals to see if it makes a difference to your fatigue?

8. u/Pick-Up-Pennies [score=1, created=2025-11-09T15:49:43]: This is now me, and yes, I am a prediabetic currently in remission. Fasting glucose: 80 and A1C: 5.1 I am able to say this because of a combination of * Rx * nutrition tracking to ensure protein and fiber daily targets * sleep, and * deliberate muscle-building exercise regimen * periodic Dr appts and bloodwork to ensure thyroid and insulin levels Not one thing, but a deliberate life filled with all the above things.
9. u/baugofbones [score=1, created=2025-11-09T16:38:30]: I think so, having normal a1c just means your excellent at controlling your glucose levels by way of controlling your intake of carbohydrates, having a fasting glucose in normal range tho to me would signifying a pretty health metabolism. Spiking to 200 after a meal would be indicative that you ate more than your body is able to process in that time so a pretty sure sign your metabolism cant keep up(which you can improve) or that your pancreas response time to secret insulin is delayed for some reason maybe due to insulin resistance or fatigue. What is your diet? Try to find the right amount of food that doesnt spike you so high, maybe youll be fine eating 3/4 of what you put on that plate but the food intake after that amount is the threshold were you body is like ok were getting jammed up here this is gonna take a while which is where your seeing the glucose in your blood rather than in your cells but the fact that your levels return to normal or close to at the 2 hour mark is a good sign, look up how to improve mitochondria health and zone 2 cardio and also look up what are the things that insult mitochondrial health like poor food and lifestyle
10. u/disposable-acoutning [score=1, created=2025-11-09T19:10:08]: something i had been doing wrong all my life is eating till i am full, in america i think its kinda sold like that and if you go for a while like that plus eating because of anxiety eating and stress eating you run into issues when you dont have a disciplined healthy zone.
11. u/Sufficient_Beach_445 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T05:22:24]: No, because you dont meet the clinical definition of prediabetic. But can you be metabolically unhealthy? Yes. I strongly urge you read Robert Lustig's book "Metabolical" or simply watch some of his videos on you tube.
12. u/AlternativeHealth461 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T09:50:08]: My reaction to sugar was similar to yours. Fatigue and brain grogginess. Look into type 3 diabetes, which is insulin resistance in the brain. It’s not good, but you can fix this. Type 3 is implicated in cognitive decline. I had this in my 50’s but changed my lifestyle. (I’m 66 now). (Sugar, carbs restricted). And yes, I was losing it. Scary, because meta-cognitively I knew something was up but had no idea why. I got my hands on a glucometer and my blood sugar was 397 after eating chicken soup with potatoes and onions and carrots. Also, because of our age and slight build, our metabolic engine is not what it used to be. Weight lifting, especially targeting quads and glutes, will give you a sugar-burning machine again. Start slow, because ANY resistance is good. Your goal is to lift to failure. Check out William Shang’s, “the thin pre-diabetic” and his other book, Fighting Insulin Resistance With Strength Training. If we don’t train, our type 2 muscle fibers get trimmed back and they are a way to decrease insulin resistance and increase glucose absorption thru GLUT-4 receptors in the muscles. But it takes exercising the muscle to failure. This will keep you out of the rest home and improve the quality of your life. I’d get a trainer if this is foreign to you. You can do this!

14. u/Lost-Ear-2575 [score=-6, created=2025-11-09T14:02:48]: There’s no such thing as prediabetic. It’s like pregnancy, either you have it or you don’t.
