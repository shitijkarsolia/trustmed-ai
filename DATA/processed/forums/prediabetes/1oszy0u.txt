===============================================================================

Context: I am a 24 year old 5' 7" white male who has consistently stayed at 140 - 150 lbs. Never weighed over 155 lbs. At one point in high school, I had 2.4% body fat and I've always struggled to gain weight. I consistently get 7.5 - 8 hours of sleep every night. Over the past few years I have been experiencing serious bouts of fatigue and lethargy after meals. No matter my level of my regular physical activity, I'd always need to take a 20 minute nap -- which would result in waking up with anxiety and heart-pounding. I was attributing my fatigue to being "too comfortable" in life or depleting my dopamine from being online (even though I never spent more than 30-60 minutes online per day). My fatigue spells were always 60 - 90 minutes after each meal. It wasn't until I had a footlong Subway sandwich that made me sleep for an hour and absolutely wrecked me the rest of the day. So I bought a Stelo and saw my fasting glucose was around 110. I immediately scheduled an appointment and found that my A1C is 5.6 -- right on the edge of prediabetes. But my doctor showed absolutely no concern for this. For the few weeks after getting my A1C back, I started lifting and playing basketball 4 times per week and taking a walk after lunch and dinner to curb the spikes. I've eliminated the tiredness, but I'm still bouncing around 130 - 150 spikes, but always returning to what I was at before the meal. I was within the 70 - 140 range 96% - 97% each day, too. I changed to snacking on string cheese and nuts, eliminated cereal from breakfasts, and eat my veggies, meat, then carbs. My wife is also a nutritionist, so we've always been conscious of what we eat. I began to see a decrease in my average glucose after implementing these changes. I've also significantly reduced my sugar intake after dinners. I used to have a cookie each night, or a quarter of a pint of ice cream, but now I've changed it to *literally 5 peanut M&amp;Ms*. I feel like I am going crazy. What's frustrating is that I woke up in the middle of the night with a crazy calf cramp and saw that my glucose has been elevated ever since then -- either I messed up my Stelo or something "snapped" in my body. Spikes are now lasting longer and going higher. The lowest glucose I'm hitting is in the high 90s... and that's when I am asleep. The doctor says I'm perfectly healthy, but I physically don't feel healthy when I am spiking, and my average glucose is now in the mid 120s. Is this undiagnosed prediabetes? Insulin resistance? Am I not advocating enough for my health? Regardless, I ordered another Stelo (3rd and 4th sensors) to confirm if my current sensor got tweaked.

Your a1c could just be higher because of something your body went through in the last three months and you really shouldn’t worry about it unless it comes back high again at your next check-up. Pain, stress, illness, and hormones can all cause spikes; your spikes are likely lasting longer just because of how anxious you are about it. Just do what you’re doing and try to relax.

Different people can tolerate different sources of sugar better than others. For instance, I cannot eat graham crackers at all. My husband, who has a prediabetic A1c, can eat a couple and not spike. It just depends on the person. Even a (very) few dark chocolate chips will spike me if I eat them alone, but putting a few in my oatmeal (that also contains butter and peanut butter) doesn't cause any issues at all. You have to play around with checking two hours after meals to see what spikes you.
