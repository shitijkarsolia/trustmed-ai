===============================================================================

I suspect I have insulin resistance due to the presence of AN and my obesity, however I can’t see my doctor about it until the end of December. Since finding out about my AN a few weeks ago I’ve changed my diet dramatically to be safe. I’m eating at a calorie deficit, all refined carbs have been replaced with whole grains, abundance of fruits, veggies and nuts, a focus on lean protein, and I keep my added sugar intake under 36g daily (usually ends up being under 20g.) I actually don’t mind eating like this nearly as much as I thought I would. I feel refreshed after eating and I feel full for longer. My question is; are cheat *meals* okay once weekly if I don’t know for sure what’s going on with my body? I have no other signs of diabetes/prediabetes and my a1c came back normal a few months ago, it’s just the AN on my neck and obesity. To me, a cheat meal would look like: - A fried chicken sandwich with french fries - A slice of pie or ice cream cone after dinner - A ramen bowl with pork at a sit-in restaurant Is it safe to have a cheat meal like this once a week? Or should I avoid all refined carbs until I know exactly what’s going on? Especially because the holidays are coming up and I love me some mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie.

Obviously it depends on how disciplined you are the rest of the week, and everyone's a little different. There are a lot of ways to drive insulin resistance, and everyone has slightly different sensitivities. My achilles heel is processed food. I have done keto, low carb, and good ol' fashioned "healthy" food. Nixing processed food (strict whole foods that results in approx 50% cals from healthy fats, 30% from protein, and 20% from net carbs with high fiber) has worked out best for me and gives me a lot of flexibility. I have a very hard time taking in more than a couple grams of starches and added sugars. Also getting your weight down will make a huge difference. Extra adipose tissue is like a IR coefficient that's always turned on. Sounds like you're on the right track with your diet. You can also mitigate the effects of a cheat meal by drinking a fiber supplement or apple cider vinegar beforehand and going for a walk immediately after you finish eating. Volume makes a difference, too... try not to totally "open the floodgates" during a cheat meal. Get just enough to reward yourself for a having a good week and scratch the itch.

Since you suspect insulin resistance, I’d suggest avoiding fried chicken and french fries for a while, or only having them once a month, since they can make insulin resistance worse. Calorie counting is useful, but it’s also important to check if your meals are likely to spike your blood sugar. You might want to try a meal spike predictor app like glucospike ai. Over the week, see how many of your meals are actually safe for insulin resistance, and adjust as needed.

I lost 50 lbs and lowered A1C from 6.4 to 5.9 having take out once a week on Friday, no restrictions on what. The rest of the time I stuck to my plan. There’s the 80/20 theory which I don’t follow precisely but basically loosely do - if you’re doing the right things 80% of the time you can do whatever the other 20, or something similar to that. Good luck!
7. u/philouthea [score=1, created=2025-11-11T03:40:36]: The cheat meal depends on how your blood sugar spikes after meals :-) only way of knowing what triggers you and what doesn't is by testing/monitoring.
8. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=-1, created=2025-11-10T01:26:56]: IANAD. &gt; I keep my added sugar intake under 36g daily (usually ends up being under 20g.) I'm not sure where you came up with that. A much better number (for most days, not every single day) would be zero. I mean, you do you, but since you're asking us for diet and health advice, ZERO added sugar, and ZERO fake sugars. If you're eating whole foods, like eggs and (minimal) fruit and vegetables and nuts and meat and some whole grains if you insist, where is the added sugar? &gt; I’m eating at a calorie deficit, Intermittent fasting is both easier and more accommodating of cheat meals.
