===============================================================================

Hi all! I’m new to this so if I phrase things wrong or if something doesn’t make sense, forgive me! My partner recently had a doctor’s appointment and received the news that they’re pre diabetic. I’m the cook of our household and researching has made me realize I have zero idea how to include pre diabetic friendly meals into what I already make. I usually make a lot of Mexican foods like birria, pozole, mole enchiladas, flautas, tortas, and many more but I want to transition into more like ceviche, tofu, salads, but I just can’t find a good recipe that doesn’t include two cans of garbanzo beans and plain Greek yogurt. We like flavor! With that being said, PLEASE TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE FOODS! let me know what you enjoy! Your favorite hacks! Substitutes! Anything! I want to add more to My list of meals I can cook that are friendly! I’ve been making lettuce wraps lately with chicken, bell peppers, and avocados in everything but I need more recipes!!! Thank you ahead of time for any help I get, I really appreciate this being a Reddit group :)

4. u/suburban-blues [score=2, created=2025-11-10T06:07:56]: breakfast: my go to is usually my pb&amp;j yogurt bowl (sf vanilla greek yogurt, berries, sf peanut butter, and half a serving of catalina crunch) lunch/dinner: i like to roast a bunch of veggies (usually zucchini, onions, and peppers) that i can portion out and freeze/eat throughout the week. i also in the beginning would swap out plain white wraps/bread for low carb wraps. i also like making my own “chipotle” bowl with some kind of protein (ground beef or chicken), beans, cheese, and pretty much any veggies i want, and instead of having it in tortillas or with rice i’ll usually go for quest protein chips snacks: cheese and olives, IQ bars, sometimes built bars, keto whipped cream, not a snack but those zero sugar syrups you can get at like tj maxx have been great for my coffees
5. u/kindcheeto [score=2, created=2025-11-10T09:42:19]: I had the same issue. I began buying Keto tortillas to substitute flour tortillas . For corn tortillas I began using blue corn tortillas because they have a lower glucose index, but only 1 or 2 per sitting. I still eat pozole but half a cup and mixed with protein, like menudo. Mole I still eat but I slightly water down the mole with chicken stock and pair it with veggies. Tortas are a no go. But you can buy some keto bread and make some awesome Mexican sandwiches with avocado, meat, cheese, bacon etc. One very important step to learn also is the order you eat food. Eat vegetables and protein first and carbs last. So before the meal starts have a small salad or a side of broccoli. This creates a “cushion” for the carbs and helps you digest slower causing your body to release less insulin.
6. u/ctbdp02 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T10:42:13]: Reduce carbs include at east 40 percent non starchy vegetable in each meal and 30 percent lean protein (tofu chicken turkey...) Avoid all processed carbs (white bread white rice regular pasta )
7. u/aggieaggielady [score=2, created=2025-11-10T10:47:40]: I put lime and cilantro in everything! Beans beans beans! Maybe swap Flour for corn tortillas? Or mitad y mitad half corn half flour if you have those where you are. Harm reduction! A lot of times I'll do like a rice bowl but have half rice and the rest lettuce as a base I honestly think you're doing great! The meals sound very balanced. Maybe find some swaps that make ur favorite foods to cook a little less carby, a little more vegetable-y Honestly my vibe is sometimes I just let myself eat whatever tf I want as long as I have a salad or fibrous vegetable like broccoli before it. It works well for me.
8. u/SergeiAndropov [score=2, created=2025-11-10T11:47:48]: This is by far my favorite: [https://www.wellplated.com/chili-mac-and-cheese/](https://www.wellplated.com/chili-mac-and-cheese/) Use whole wheat pasta. It tastes amazing, is ridiculously easy, and has never caused a spike in either me or my wife. For Mexican food in general, a lot of it can be adapted purely by switching to whole wheat tortillas.
