Edit/preface: I know protein doesn’t raise glucose. I am wondering only regarding insulin. Hoping someone can explain this or give guidance… So I have been trying to eat even more protein. One relatively easy method in addition to the already large amount of protein I eat is whey protein. It is low carb, sweetened with stevia or monk fruit. My dilemma is that I read whey protein while it doesn’t increase glucose, it DOES raise insulin levels due to the leucine content, which also demands substantial insulin to reach your cells. So… is whey protein just counter intuitively a poor choice for prediabetes and insulin resistance because of this or a suitable protein source.

2. u/hotheadnchickn [score=4, created=2025-11-10T10:42:16]: It is well established that whey generally triggers outsized insulin release and insulin stays elevated for hours. Ofc CGMs show us that individual responses to food vary widely and I’m sure some folks are more sensitive to whey than others. I have been trying to avoid it but I also need to have more protein which is always a challenge for me bc I don’t like red meat or eating poultry/fish more than a few times a week. So I have actually added some dairy back to my diet… My rule for now is to have probiotic dairy (yogurt or cottage cheese with live cultures) so at least I’m getting the gut benefit. And limit it to one serving a day max.

I only drink whey protein isolate as my body can't digest milk based products. I usually drink it three times a day - one in the morning with water (add creatine), then in the evening before heading to the gym and then at night in my smoothie - 1 scoop (around 22 gms) each time. Over the 5 month period, since the detection of Perdiabetes, I have lost 15 pounds of body fat, gained 5 pounds of muscle and reversed prediabetes. I didn't have any CGM so don't know if whey protein spiked my blood sugar but I didn't care as I needed more protein than ever to sustain muscle building and lose my body fat. So, worked out for me I guess. I still continue to follow the same regime.

Journey started in February and I just got blood test in early Nov that I was 5.6 (still, after another test in July revealed I went down to 5.6). Last Feb my doctor said I needed more protein. So I added a protein shake after my morning workout (I eat breakfast before that too). I look forward to it every day too as it tastes great and does have 1/2 banana (instead of a whole banana). Ingredients: Orgain Organic Chocolate Protein powder, cinnamon, Peanut Butter, 1/2 banana (even though recipe calls for full banana), almond milk (I don't drink real milk), cocoa powder, ice cubes. I don't know if this answers your question but my A1C has been good even with drinking a protein shake every day.

6. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T15:56:40]: &gt; So I have been trying to eat even more protein. Is there a health reason why? Is there a reason you can't meet your protein needs from whole foods?
7. u/LMAquatics [score=2, created=2025-11-10T16:29:03]: There's some evidence that regularly consuming extremely high doses of leucine can trigger IR. But there's also evidence that "normal" doses increase insulin sensitivity. This has mostly been studied in rats, as far as I know. And the dose given to rats in order to trigger IR was pretty high (something like 1.5g/kg of body weight). I have a whey protein shake post workout w/ fairlife milk about 4x/week. (approx 45g protein and about 5g leucine) A1c is currently around 4.9 and haven't seen any evidence that the protein shake is having any negative effects. It's important to note that they don't totally understand what triggers insulin resistance. It was thought that excessive insulin exposure lead to desensitization, but it's probably far more complex than that. There's evidence that increasing insulin response or introducing exogenous insulin actually reverses IR in people with IR.
8. u/yainlawff [score=4, created=2025-11-10T11:02:43]: For me, I find that with whey-based protein, consuming half the recommended serving (1/2 scoop, 1/2 bar) helps prevent/reduce spikes. I usually wait about 30 mins before finishing the other half. But with plant-based protein bars I don’t get a spike. I haven’t tried plant-based protein powder yet. So you may try playing with portions to help with spiking with whey protein sources.
9. u/echoes808 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T12:12:22]: I have type 1 diabetes and I take whey protein sometimes, it doesn't really increase insulin requirements at all when I take it with a normal meal. However if I take it without any carbs, it will definitely increase it. I believe it's called "protein sparing effect of carbs" or so
10. u/baugofbones [score=1, created=2025-11-10T13:47:29]: Ive been back and forth on this and due to the increase in insulin i would like to stay away from it and i did for about 2 years, but now today i find it so hard to get enough protein in i actually am taking a chance right now and am reintroducing it to my diet and i think its improving at least to me my perceived health, ill have to get blood work done to see what its really doing to my lipids and insulin levels but right away i do feel better could be cause i meeting my essential amino acid requirement and could easily get that done with real food but i noticed also a bump in morning fasted glucose numbers like 10-20mgdl and the occasional under 100 but its mostly 110-120 i do workout tho and a bit over weight with muscle i think other people can have different results for sure
11. u/madogblue [score=1, created=2025-11-10T14:49:38]: I can have a large Shake with A big scoop of Whey , water, ice cubes, spinach, olive oil, frozen berries, and a tablespoon of chia seeds with basically a zero rise in Glucose.
12. u/checkmynamelater [score=1, created=2025-11-10T15:41:53]: Which brand of protein do you guys recommend? I am also vegetarian and looking for good options of whey protein brand with clean ingredients.
13. u/patomov [score=1, created=2025-11-10T19:38:54]: They key is to consume it with whole milk and ceylan cinnamon. Shorter and less pronounced glucose spike. Even better if you include some fiber.
14. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T09:48:02]: Yeah, whey protein does raise insulin slightly because of leucine, but that’s not a bad thing. It helps muscles absorb amino acids and can actually improve glucose control in the long run. Studies even show that having whey before or with meals can reduce post-meal sugar spikes. I take unflavored whey isolate with cocoa powder and monk fruit sweetener. Even though it’s pure protein, pairing it with fiber like berries or kale makes it more balanced. I learned this from the glucospike AI app, which suggests combos like this to add specific fiber and healthy fats. Just make sure your powder is high quality with minimal ingredients. I’ve used whey for 15 years without issues, but everyone’s response is different, so start small and see how you feel.
15. u/Due_Net_3342 [score=-1, created=2025-11-10T10:16:55]: if you use grass fed clean whey protein isolate it will actually help. There are some brands which even have sweetened ones with steviol glycosides which doesnt increase glucose
