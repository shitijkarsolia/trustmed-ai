===============================================================================

Has anyone else experienced increased insulin resistance and blood sugar issues from a food intolerance? I’ve done some research, and it looks like there is / can be a correlation. I’m asking because in the past two years, I’ve discovered I have a severe soy intolerance (can’t have any form), and when ingested it seems to mess with me.
