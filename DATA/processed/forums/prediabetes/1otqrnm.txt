===============================================================================

I bought a big bag of almond flour from Costco on impulse. Does anyone have good recipes for baking with it? I know its better to avoid baked goods altogether, but I still like an occasional treat and am looking for healthier options for that.

If curious, thus is my own concoction. 2.5 cups almond flour, stick of butter, and 3 tablespoons of alulose. Or erythritol. Prebake the apples a bit bc the almond flour crumble bakes very fast.

I freeze the and eat them straight from the freezer so they have some crunch, but they’re good fresh too. https://detoxinista.com/vegan-almond-flour-chocolate-chip-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-23550

Use less buttermilk as they seem to cook better as a thicker batter. They will be flatter than regular pancakes but are pretty good. Even my boys at home enjoy them.
