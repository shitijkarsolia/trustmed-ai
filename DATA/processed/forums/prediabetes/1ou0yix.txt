Title: Finally lowered my A1C to 5.9!!! 🥳🥳🥳 As far as I know, it has not been this low in at least 18 years.  I have been stuck on 6 or 6.1 for years! I am so happy!!! My goal is to get it under 5.5. 🤗

===============================================================================

I’m so happy and I know I will achieve my goal. I am a vegetarian and I eat most of my meals the Glucose Goddess method. I started taking 500mg. of Metformin Once a day, about 10 months ago. I also increased my daily protein intake a few months ago. I’m on a program to get stronger. 💪🏾 I practice intermittent fasting and I enjoy this way of life. Honestly I think following the GG method of eating and drinking the apple cider has benefitted me the most! I am so happy. I am not on a diet. I will primarily eat this way for life.
