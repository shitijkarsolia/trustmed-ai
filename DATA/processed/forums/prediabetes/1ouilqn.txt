===============================================================================

Scratching my head at some test results. On 500mg metformin ER daily, my fasting blood glucose is consistently still above 100, but my A1c is 5.2 and my fasting insulin is 5.4. I am lean and active, and I don't experience blood sugar spikes, but I have classic symptoms like excessive thirst, urination, hunger, and extremely intense sugar cravings. What could cause this?
