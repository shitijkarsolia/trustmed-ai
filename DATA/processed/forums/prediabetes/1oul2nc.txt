===============================================================================

Hello, I’m not sure where to begin. I’m 28, 5’10, 222lbs (heaviest I’ve ever been), and recently found out I’m prediabetic. I see myself going down the same road that my family did, as type 2 diabetes is common in my family. I’m trying to get out of that initial shock from that doctor visit, and figure out a plan. I don’t want to be in that same road. I’m so lost. I recently joined a gym and feel so overwhelmed and lost by all the equipment. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing, for how long (reps?), and when I should be doing cardio, etc. I also don’t know about diet and how to manage that and track it or even upkeep it. I’m frustrated in myself that I let myself get to this point, but I’m frustrated that I don’t know how to get out. The small changes I made were I stopped drinking alcohol, smoking weed, and I swapped out soda for zero sugar options. A small win, I guess. Any advice is appreciated. I just want to lose the pounds, get my blood sugar in order, keep it off, and stay healthy. I don’t want to end up diabetic and on the same road that my family has. Thank you to anyone that took a moment to read this.

Learn about the balanced plate approach to eating (half plate veggies, 1/4 plate protein and 1/4 plate whole grains or starchy veggies like potatoes). Then see about free diabetes education classes in your area. My city offers them online via zoom so they’re very convenient. Be careful with advice in this forum and other places online that will push you too far to zero carb/no sugar like that’s the only way (and it’s not sustainable for the vast majority of people - life is long!). Follow the advice of trained professionals like Registered Dieticians and diabetes educators (usually nurses with specific training).

Still work to be done. My morning blood sugar wouldn't go lower than 100 no matter what I did but these past 2 weeks I've had more &lt;100s than &gt;100s. What I did First thing in the morning - Cup of Chia seeds in 250ml Water (MUST be soaked overnight). Apparently it shields against blood sugar spikes and so far I'm seeing the results. Lunch - Salad with lots of Protein Dinner - Normal home meal, whatever the wife cooks I completely eliminated the following from my life:- - Fast food/dining out (though reintroduced them 2 months back to be strictly once a week) - Sugar (I take Steviana as an alternative in my teas) Exercise - weight lifting twice a week - cardio - after workout I treat myself to Beat Saber to game and burn more.
3. u/Primary_Slip139 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T14:46:36]: 6 months ago I was diagnosed too, I know it feels scary at the start but a week ago I had another rest which showed that I'm no longer pre diabetic. I did this without stepping into the gym once or totally giving up sugars/carbs and lost about 8kg. I made a lot of lifestyle changes which took sacrifice but I did it in a sustainable way, meaning I made changes that I could keep for the long term. A lot of people go on extreme diets and exercise plans and suffer burn out and cannot keep it up, so be wary of this. The short summary is eating more fibre, greatly reducing processed food/sugars and creating a calorie deficit. In terms of exercise I would walk 30-60 mins daily, instead of strenuous exercises like running I found walking peaceful and a stressless exercise which made it easier to do daily.

You don’t need to lose weight you need to gain muscle. Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burn fat, and increase metabolism. As far as using your gym equipment and what exercises do you goes, It is easier seen on video than anyone else can explain to you here. I’m sure your gym has somebody that can assist you. If not, YouTube is full of videos.
5. u/hotheadnchickn [score=1, created=2025-11-11T16:17:00]: Ugh you’re going to get so much conflicting advice! There are lots of different options that can be effective for managing your blood sugar: low carb, whole foods, keto, calorie counting, volume eating, intermittent fasting etc I think the least restrictive diet that actually works and that you enjoy is the best one. What that is varies for each individual but I would suggest looking into the Mediterranean diet Whatever you pick, don’t keep snacks or treats at home that aren’t aligned with your diet. Make treats soemthing special that you buy single serving as needed. When you do have one (occasionally), enjoy it all the way, guilt free, and then go back to your normal way of healthy eating. Quitting alcohol and weed are huge steps! Give yourself credit and work on your self-compassion and positive self-talk :) Being friendly to yourself will support you better than being unkind. Sugar free sweeteners are a good step away from sugar but most of them are known to cause metabolic problems and don’t decrease diabetes risk relative to regular soda. When you’re ready, maybe try swapping some out for La Croix or spin drift or make a big pitcher of unsweetened ice tea. Going with the idea of the least restrictive thing that is effective, I wouldn’t start counting calories if I were you. If you need to down the road, okay, but it’s a pain and I wouldn’t unless you absolutely need to. From here, improving your diet and quitting weed should help regulate your appetite. I would suggest practicing mindful eating! Only eat when you feel hungry - if you want to eat, make sure you are actually hungry, not bored, lonely, or stressed. When you eat, pay some attention to your food and really enjoy it, don’t eat mindlessly. Don’t eat while you’re doing work or driving. Try to slow down to your eating. Stop when you feel satisfied/no longer hungry, not stuffed. If improving your diet and mindfulness don’t get your weight going in the right direction after a few months, then you can think about counting calories, intermittent fasting, or other interventions, but no need to start there. The glucose goddess also has good tips on managing blood sugar that are pretty doable. Starting meals with vegetables has helped me and it’s pretty easy to integrate a starter salad or just some crudite before most meals, or to eat the veg part of my meal first. The best exercise is the one you’ll actually do… just like diet, this is about making long term changes so they need to work and feel good for you, not just be about will power. An ideal program includes cardio and strength exercises but just start with where you are. If the gym is overwhelming, get a fitness tracker and make a daily step goal and take walks. Or do YouTube fitness videos. Or go back to some sport you enjoyed as a kid or always wanted to try, like a rec soccer league or jujitsu. You can reevaluate in six months and decide if you want to add more or try different activities.

8. u/PAVibing [score=1, created=2025-11-13T11:16:20]: Hey everyone 👋 I’ve noticed a lot of talk here about pre-diabetes and blood sugar management. I’m a registered dietitian who helps people prevent or delay type 2 diabetes through realistic, flexible nutrition changes — no extreme diets required. If you’ve been told you have pre-diabetes or your A1C’s creeping up, small, consistent tweaks can make a big difference. I run a private practice focused on this and am always happy to share tips or point you to good resources. You’ve got this — prevention really works. 💪
9. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T15:00:04]: Read either *The Obesity Code* or *The Diabetes Code* by Dr. Jason Fung. (He is a practicing physician, not one of these quacks.) All your questions answered. Or you can get all the same information by watching his videos on youtube. &gt; I stopped drinking alcohol, smoking weed, and I swapped out soda for zero sugar options. Congratulations on the first two! In the long run - drink water.

11. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=0, created=2025-11-11T19:49:58]: First, don't panic. I had the same feeling when I saw my A1C was at 5.7. I had similar habits, and all you need is patience and to continue the efforts. Two habits I learned from this blog (https://glucospike.ai/blog/just-found-out-you-re-borderline-pre-diabetic-start-with-these-7-golden-rules): • ⁠Wait at least 90 minutes before having any snack or milk-based drink after a meal. I used to snack or drink milk too soon after eating, which led to spikes, and adjusting this made a big difference. • ⁠Walking after meals is super helpful. I’ve been doing this consistently, and now my A1C is at 5.1. It all boils down to insulin resistance. Instead of tracking calories, I started tracking which meals were spiking me with the glucospike AI app. That helped me see what was actually causing issues. Sometimes we guess a meal is “good,” but it’s not always the case. By the way, you’re lucky you found out now. It’s the perfect time to fix a few things and build healthier insulin resistance and A1C. Don’t worry, it’s not the end of the world, just an obstacle. You’ll love all the new learnings ahead!
