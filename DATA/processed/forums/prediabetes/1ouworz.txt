Hi everyone! 29F, 249lbs, 52 BMI (if thats real), 5.7 A1C My gyno put me on Metformin 3x a day, birth control and Inositol supplements. More concerning details, my mom was just diagnosed with Crohn's disease and full on diabetes triggered by that, and we have no idea if that is genetic yet. Don't own a blood sugar monitoring machine, will invest in one when I can. Now that my "stats" are out of the way- i really don't know what to do :( I WFH at a computer 1-10pm every day, so I genuinely do not have the time to prepare a full days worth of meals. I'm trying to get my schedule changed to accomadate this, actually. But I have to take the Metformin with food or else I get sick, and tbh I only ever manage to take two pills a day because I only have the time for two meals. And then when it comes to food, I'm lactose intollerant AND partially allergic to seafood, but thankfully salmon is fine. I'm going to push myself to try and take walks in the morning but otherwise I'm at a loss Due to my job I'm extremely sedentary, and I know that it's up to me to change that but this work schedule is getting in my way. Can't cook after work because as soon as I get off I have to go to bed, mornings are spent trying to feed myself and complete whatever chores or tasks I have to do before my shift starts. My go to meals have always been protein over rice beause it's something I can make fast, and now I'm making sure to cool my rice off to build up resistance starch and add lentils for extra fiber, but I know that's just a bandaid. Feeling really disheartened because every sort of food plan i read on either relies heavily on dairy for protein or for long cooking process for the vegetables. That's not even to mention snacks for my meagre 15 minute breaks- I've resorted to eating fistfulls of plain baby carrots to try and get SOME fiber in where I can. If anyone has any advice that would work with this sort of schedule I'd really appreciate it....... hoping to eventually find a good GP I can turn to for assistance with the pre-diabetes, since my Gyno is mainly focused on the PCOS, but that hasn't worked out so far.

Yes, it sucks making 7 days worth of dinners all at once, but if you do this you can have an entire weeks worth of healthy options that are either frozen and thawed the day of, or kept in the fridge and microwaved. Yes, this sounds exhausting to contemplate, but quite frankly the health issues get scarier if you neglect your diet too long so this is what works for me. I'd also suggest meeting with a nutritionist, they can help you identify which foods work best with your dietary needs and can help you start looking for recipes that fit your needs.

If you work from home and don't have children you can structure things so it is easy to manage. It'll be tighter with a significant commute and very hard with children. Sleep from 12-7. That gives you 6 hours to have a breakfast prep two meals, make a salad that you'll eat before your meals, exercise, shower, and eat lunch. Having a huge salad before every meal was the biggest game changer for me. Not only was it more impactful than cutting refined sugars. Which we have to do anyway. But it made me full for longer when paired with food. If you're full for longer it will mean that you can have a light dinner and still be okay. Having your last meal before 6 is also something very helpful for managing prediabetes.

I have meal prep staples I make every Sunday to make lunches and dinners easier when I’m working: - [Bean dip](https://www.loveandlemons.com/white-bean-dip/) (great for snacking or as a wrap filling with chicken and lettuce and tomato) - [Air fried chicken](https://www.myforkinglife.com/bbq-air-fryer-chicken-breast/) (to use in salads, wraps, tacos, etc.) - hard boiled eggs - cut up carrot and celery sticks (stored in water in the fridge they keep fresh for the week, changing water every day) - oven roasted veggies like sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, etc. I use them in salads or just as sides for meals - oven roasted sausages (to eat as is or in salads or tomato sauce) I have it down to a science so it takes about 2 hours. I pop on a movie and cook while I watch. Also, there’s no shame in smart convenience foods - pre-bagged coleslaw is easy to turn into an oil and vinegar slaw, pre-washed lettuce makes making salads easier, frozen veggies are a healthy side dish, baby carrots and store bought hummus is a healthy snack.
