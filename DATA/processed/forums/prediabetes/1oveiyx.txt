===============================================================================

I was diagnosed pre diabetic about 3 months ago after requesting my first diabetes test. My teeth have been going downhill for the last 4 or 5 years. My dentist kept asking if I was doing drugs. I’m now 52. I thought it was just old age lol. Anyway I had to switch dentist this year due to an insurance change. I had to wait a few months to get in with the new dentist but when I began explaining what was happening with my teeth the first question the new dentist asked was if I was diabetic!! Scared me but things started making sense. My feet have been hurting, burning, stinging and just feeling wrong for about a year and a half. Now it’s starting in my hands just recently since my diagnosis. And I’ve been trying to change my diet. But from reading on here I see I’ve made some mistakes!! (Syntha 6 protein powder, etc etc) I have lost 6 pounds though. Down to 188 from my heaviest weight ever 194. My weight since I was in my 30s was always 145-150 which is pushing it. I’m only 5’4”. But since I’ve started on antidepressants in the past few years I’ve been gaining weight. Even when coming off one to try another I’d gain 10 more pounds. When they added Auvelity to boost my antidepressant I gained 20 more. I made an appt for another a1c and fasting glucose test for last week as I’ve been reading on here it seemed like everyone was getting it rechecked every 3 months. When I showed up turns out it was a Dr appointment instead. They only redo the test every year for pre diabetics. But my a1c was 6 and my fasting glucose was 126. The 126 is diabetic range and my symptoms lead me to believe I am diabetic, even though the letter he sent me with my labs said I was pre diabetic. I told him I would like to be tested again. The dr said I probably have a vitamin deficiency B 12 or Iron causing my foot issues and a bit of carpel tunnel in my hands😡😡 my labs for those came back fine. A neurologist office called today to schedule the appointment for my nerve conduction study for February. Coincidentally I go back to the Dr in February a few days later for my a1c test. He said I could do a 6 month recheck of it😡😡 Anyway here I am doing the best I can with no help from my Dr. except for the exercise part. As every time I’m up doing anything for more than 10 minutes I start sweating and continue to sweat until I can sit down and rest a bit. After explaining that to the Dr he asked me to keep a log of when it happens, what I’m doing etc. I told him everything over 10 minutes. Showering, doing dishes, getting my son ready for bed, everything!! Eeesh😵‍💫😵‍💫 So I’ve decided to try the Dexcom Stelo for a month. It’s $100 for 2 sensors on Amazon atm. It’s a bit pricey for me and I understand it may not be the correct numbers but I’m hoping I can at least learn what makes it go up and down or stay up or whatever I need to learn about how my food choices affect me. I honestly expected to lose more than 6 pounds over the last 3 months. My mom was actually diagnosed with diabetes a few weeks before I was diagnosed pre diabetic!! Weird coincidence or what!! And she’s said I could use her finger prick machine some for the next month. So I’ll have those numbers maybe a couple times a week. Are there certain times it would be better to take my numbers?? I can use it whenever I need to. And finally (sorry for my life story) I’ve read about the cgms needing covers. They only have one for each sensor in the box. What do I need to order with the Stelo?? Thank you to anyone who reads this tldr!! I have a disabled son ( sleep and stress are things I cannot change) and 2 grand babies. I need to be in better health. Any help or advise at all would be so appreciated!!

The CGM helped me see what foods I can’t really handle … I don’t eat anything white now (rice, potatoes, apples, bananas, bread) that isn’t dairy. It sounds like you aren’t feeling very good. It may take a bit but I feel so much better now than I did 6 months ago. My go-tos are plain yogurt, carrots and celery, and eggs. Not exciting but it’s worth it. Good luck and keep at it!
2. u/NotDiabeticDad [score=3, created=2025-11-12T12:42:07]: Hey, the Stelo is information. To be honest, the Patterson cannot do much with that information. The Stelo has been incredibly useful to me because I joined a diabetes reversal program called Heald. My early graphs, would have looked perfectly normal if I didn't have that guidance to make sense of it from their nutritionist. Check if your insurance covers a nutritionist. You can check out the program I joined since it's only 50 a month, cheaper than the Stelo. Over the course of the program I have added fiber before every meal. Had my last meal earlier. Stopped snacking (actually quite easy if you have enough fiber). This post is mine shows just how much of a difference just a little bit of focus on eating right will make: https://www.reddit.com/r/stelo/s/Gwcnzwdf2g I was always good about working out. I would suggest showing down. The key to distance is go slower. Biking and walking are both good ways to establish base fitness. You slow down enough and you can go a long time. Just keep going. Don't worry about being exerted. I've run marathons and the key is you go so slow that you get annoyed with yourself. It's slower than how slow you have to go to feel you can go forever.

Please read *The Diabetes Code* or *The Obesity Code*, by Dr. Jason Fung. Or watch some of his videos online. Or listen to *The Obesity Code* podcast. It's a few years old, but ... human biology hasn't changed since 2018. I've probably listened to every episode several times. His advice is simple to follow, costs nothing, and has changed my life. I hope it will change yours. Also - stop drinking **anything** other than water, unsweetened coffee, and unsweetened tea. **Stop snacking.** For now, stop eating ANYTHING sweet. Also - stop drinking **anything** other than water, unsweetened coffee, and unsweetened tea. **Stop snacking.** For now, stop eating ANYTHING sweet. And read those books. Start TODAY. ps costco has good prices ($30/each) on CGMs, if your doctor will write a prescription. they are very easy to use. nothing extra is required.

If the neuropathy doesn't improve I would try to add b12 sublinguals supplements. Beware that your symptoms can get worse before getting better. I would get your ferritin tested as well. Anything under 100 can cause symptoms. Unfortunately western labs say that 20 is fine when really that is deficient. Is your mom type one or type 2. If she is type one I would get texted for type one. I would also try to find a new Dr.
5. u/CapriKitzinger [score=2, created=2025-11-13T01:10:50]: Stelo has been great for me. Screw all the haters!!! Is it perfect? Nope. Just know that the reading on the Stelo is about 10-15mins delayed. And it’s doesn’t hurt at all. Don’t get scared. Heat will make the numbers go up a bit. So you may see a spike in the shower. If you get diagnosed with the beaties, I think insurance may cover CGMs. I’ve found that it’s easier for people to manage spikes. It’s much harder to control fasting glucose. Spiking over 140 is bad. You kinda sound like my dads numbers. He goes to 165 and that’s it. Me……I start and 90 and go to 180 in 45mins. Crazy right?
6. u/SierraMountainMom [score=1, created=2025-11-14T12:45:35]: I started with a Stelo and showed the data along with my blood test results and then my Dr prescribed me a Libre, which is about $25/month cheaper. I was able to use my FSA funds to buy the Stelo direct from their site, if you have that or a HSA.
