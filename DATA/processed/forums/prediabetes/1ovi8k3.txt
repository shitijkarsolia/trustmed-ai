===============================================================================

Sticking to a new diet feels soo hard. I've tried myfitnesspal but every time I overeat or slip up, I feel like a failure and then end up giving up and having to start back at square 1. Does this happen to anyone else? What has actually helped you? Meeting with dieticians, meal planning tools, other apps... whatever it is, please tell me what actually works for more than like a week!!!

1. u/EggieRowe [score=3, created=2025-11-12T15:17:20]: Catastrophisizing the consequences worked for me. *Cheetos don’t taste better than having toes. *Insulin is expensive and I can’t afford health insurance. *Eating anything will be less (or more but in a bad way) exciting when I’m blind. Also, I already have early signs of heart disease, so the inflammation from high blood sugar will make a heart attack or stroke more likely for me. Brass tacks: I had to decide if my life was worth living; if so, how do I want to live these remaining years?
2. u/myorangeOlinMarkIV [score=2, created=2025-11-12T19:18:29]: This was very hard for me because I love to cook and bake. I now am obsessive about planning ahead to the meals I will make for myself and foods to have in the kitchen I can eat. I have packages of Tofu for quick protein sauté, lots of nuts, cheese and vegetables to roast or a quick salad. I love to grill chicken and vegetables. About 6 months before my diagnosis out of the blue, my diabetic uncle died after surgery to remove his foot. Even though it is hard and a hassle at times the alternative scenarios are nothing we want to deal with, you can do this!

I started tracking meals w/ Cronometer and enjoyed making numbers go down lol. Also just got a CGM and I have a feeling I am really going to enjoy making line go up/down haha

Instead of just tracking calories, try tools that show how your body responds to food. Seeing what causes energy crashes or stable glucose helps you make better choices without guilt. GlucoSpike AI is a food coach app that does this well. It predicts spikes, suggests better swaps, includes calories and macros, and even tells you how long to walk after a meal. Way easier to stick with.
