===============================================================================

I have started my journey into reversing my pre diabetes. I was diagnosed this past July of having a A1C of 5.8. as im learning more of this i couldn't help but wonder if my result are not correct. I was taking Zyrtec-D for over several years daily. yes daily. I stop taking it about a month after I was diagnosed. I have read online that sudafed can elevate blood glucose and overtime could show higher A1C. I do plan to get retested in late January as I recently changed jobs and will not have insurance until then. I guess I am asking if this sounds like something that could of caused my A1C to be 5.8? i do not have or show any pre symptons of pre diabetes. i also had an eye exam recently and shownno signs of pre diabetes as well.I unfortunately do not have any other blood work that would show other wise what my A1C was prior. thanks for any feed back.
