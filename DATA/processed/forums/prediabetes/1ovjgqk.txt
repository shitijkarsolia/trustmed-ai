I love data so I’m honestly having a blast lol, it’s so cool to be able to see what my body is doing “behind the scenes” without me even thinking about it.

2. u/Disastrous_Pin_5400 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T16:05:02]: Not really . Seem like regular spikes post having a carb lunch / dinner . If it goes beyond 140 then it’s slightly more concerning

4. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T09:15:24]: These spikes are way below any dangerous levels. Not even close. And it’s the spike that make your body release insulin.
5. u/SuzMichell [score=1, created=2025-11-13T13:54:19]: I think I’ve read that metabolically healthier people have a double spike, it’s more typical for prediabetics to only have one. See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109707034444?via%3Dihub In this publication from the American Journal of Cardiology, it says that exaggerated post-meal spikes in blood glucose and lipids when repeated multiple times daily eventually lead to atherosclerotic risk factors and CAD (Coronary Artery Disease). At only 80 mg/dl = 4.4 mmol/L the Cardiovascular (CV) risk of post-meal elevated blood sugar starts to increase. By 140 mg/dl = 7.8 mmol/L, the point at which we traditionally only begin to classify patients as glucose intolerant or pre-diabetic, the risk is already increased by 58% My Lingo CGM says a typical healthy daily average value is under 6.5 mmol /117mg/dL

7. u/CapriKitzinger [score=1, created=2025-11-13T20:37:38]: These are fine as long as they stay under 140 or so. Nothing like mine. 90 to 180 in 45 minutes.
