===============================================================================

Hey all, Hopefully this hasn’t been asked repeatedly and I missed it, but I recently (six weeks ago) was diagnosed as pre-diabetic. My lab work results had my A1C at 5.7 and and avg glucose of 117. I’ve since been looking at carb/sugar amounts on what I buy, and am switching up my diet, avoiding pasta, white breads, etc. And this weekend I bought a home glucose monitor. Yesterday afternoon, about four hours after breakfast, I tested at 104. First thing this morning, I got a result of 128! This was after 8 hours sleep. I thought it was supposed to be lower after a night’s rest and now I’m confused and a little disheartened. Is there something I’m not taking into account? Thanks in advance!
