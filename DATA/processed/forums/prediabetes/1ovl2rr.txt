===============================================================================

Hey folks, thanks for this great community of resources. Just wanted to share my experience (much of which has been mentioned at various times). First, if you're prediabetic, get an annual eye exam. 2 months ago, I got my first eye exam since 2019, and I was told that I had some retinopathy. Because I hadn't had an exam for so long, it's impossible to say if this is a recent development, or something that happened during the pandemic when my A1c went up to 6.1. Since 2019, I've typically fluctuated between 5.7-5.9 in my A1c except during the pandemic when it went to 6.1. Because it was on the low end of prediabetic, I always figured that I was okay, but the eye exam told me otherwise. Once I got a Continuous Glucose Monitor, I could see what was going on. During intermittent fasting periods (typically 10pm-12noon), my blood sugar would be low, sometimes too low (occasionally below 70). Then I would rapidly eat a lot and my BG would spike sharply (up to 174 once during Afternoon Tea) and then drop sharply. There seem to be mixed opinions, but I've been reading that these sharp spikes are harmful even if they drop rapidly. I then took a break from IF, and my BG has been a lot steadier since then (note, this is in conjunction with changing my diet significantly so it wasn't just cutting out the IF). It still goes up and down but not nearly as sharply as previously. However, despite my improvement in avoiding the high spikes, my estimated A1c from the CGM graphs hasn't changed much--it's gone from 5.8 when I first started to 5.7. I am theorizing that when I was IF, my lows were extremely low and thus artificially depressed the A1c average so I never realized I was doing damage with my spikes. This is a where relying only on A1c can lead you astray. I'm really grateful for the CGM and wish I had started a long time ago. After cutting the obvious carbs (bread, cookies, etc) out of my diet, I'm finding it not too awful to keep my BG below 140. At some point, I'll experiment and see what carbs don't spike me (I haven't tried rice or potatoes yet because at first), but for now, I'm using the CGM to find what works. If this is a permanently lifestyle change--I'm okay with it. Any condition that forces me to exercise more and eat more vegetables and fat is not the worst thing in the world. And thank goodness that prediabetes is something that we can exert control over.

2. u/IllNopeMyselfOut [score=3, created=2025-11-12T18:21:15]: I'm going to admit upfront that I googled around before I replied, rather than really knowing this area well, but are you sure that your retinopathy is blood sugar related? Other conditions can cause it, and it seems sort of surprising that you had observable damage without having long term, sustained high blood sugar. One site I was reading indicated that even keeping blood sugar under 7 for diabetics will help decrease your risk, and you were way below that. I totally agree that people should have annual eye exams. My own experience with over-the-counter CGM make me a little skeptical about how reliable they are, but it's certainly not going to hurt. If one is likely to develop retinopathy in the pre-diabetic range, it would seem much more likely that we'd all move to medication to keep it lower.
3. u/turbo69prop [score=3, created=2025-11-13T06:21:11]: Have you tried meal sequencing - eating fibre and protein first before carbs? I am not concerned about blood sugar so much nowadays as I move to track insulin level. You can have normal blood sugar but very high insulin, signalling that you might have insulin resistance.
4. u/Sufficient_Beach_445 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T16:29:15]: Focus on sugar. By far the worst carb. Sugar in the form of sucrose(the white stuff) and high fructose corn syrup.
