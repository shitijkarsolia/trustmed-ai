===============================================================================

I’ve noticed it takes about 45 minutes from the time I eat for my CGM to show me the results. If I wanted to crank out some push-ups or bicep curls to bring it down, I’m assuming the best time is as soon as possible after you eat. What’s the general consensus? Am I wasting my time doing push-ups when I see the spike and panic?

2. u/n_i_x_e_n [score=5, created=2025-11-13T02:24:09]: As far as I understand, it is fine to wait 15-30 minutes after you’re done eating. It takes a little while for the food to be digested and the blood glucose levels to rise. If I recall correctly it might even be counterproductive to exercise immediately after eating, but I’m sure someone more knowledgeable will chime in.

5. u/RoxMpls [score=2, created=2025-11-13T05:52:15]: I have found that taking a walk 30 minutes after I start eating is best for me, but I have also found that if I don't walk until some time after that, walking is still effective at bring my bg down from wherever it is at the moment.
