===============================================================================

i was thinking of doing a liquid fast starting friday, leading up to thanksgiving. maybe like eating every 12-24 hours, to keep blood sugar levels steady. i've never fasted as a prediabetic. 5.7 a1c, any advice?

If your goal is to have a steady glucose levels there are several options to choose rather than focusing on fasting. Some people like to starve themselves, it makes them feel better. But if you’re not that type, then choose slow, releasing complex, carbs, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Now pair this with resistance training and fasted cardio in the morning. Fasting eats away the muscles you have period. Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat, and increase increases metabolism. There’s another concept that people don’t realize. Cutting carbs and just eating proteins and high fat may blunt your glucose spikes, but it’ll also causes insulin resistance, which will make you spike on everything.

Not because that one day is bad. But rather because they disrupt your discipline and routine and you take time to get back into your routine. There are many studies showing the benefits of fasting. But if this is early in your journey, I would recommend doing something that lets you manage Thanksgiving as a better investment. What breaks in Thanksgiving is travel, busyness with prep, and food. Figuring out how to eat well on the go, how to get fiber in to manage food, maintain workout habit, . I think that will be a better more sustainable investment. Having said that, I don't know where you are in your journey. So my apologies if my suggestion was irrelevant.

When first diagnosed I watched Dr Jason Fung who likes intermittent fasting to help heal your pancreas. I now do one meal a day ( early dinner). I have done several multi day fasts . I try a three day fast every 6 months Lean protein and low carbohydrate veggies. Be careful at thanksgiving. It can be a very high carbohydrate veggies m al. Portions matter. So lots of turkey. Small spoon of squash, meat stuffing better than bread stuffing , green beans. ( skip the pie and white potatoes). ( my Husband gets the pie- I get a bite. And dark chocolate chips have been my best high impact , feels like dessert solution Good luck! Walk after dinner :-)
