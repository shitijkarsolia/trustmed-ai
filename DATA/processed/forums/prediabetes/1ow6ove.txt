1. u/LMAquatics [score=2, created=2025-11-13T10:20:39]: I used stelo for a little while and I had some *bad* sensors and dexcom refused to replace them. I would have to do a few finger sticks to get an idea of how low/high each sensor was reading. Just switched to Lingo but only on my first sensor. So far it's pretty close to recent lab tests.
