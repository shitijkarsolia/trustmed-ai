===============================================================================

I'm looking for anyone who can share similar stories on reversing pre-diabetes. A little bit about myself - * I have PCOS, have been pregnant twice with diet-controlled gestational diabetes, and diabetes runs in both sides of the family. * I am currently 21 weeks postpartum with an A1c of 5.4%, but Fructosamine of 256 (translates to 6.0% A1C). * At 7 weeks postpartum, I took a 2 hour 75g OGTT and had an elevated 1hr number (&gt;200), then 149 at 2hr. * My fasting numbers are consistenly low (low 70s). * I have tested negative for T1 antibodies. Currently, I feel very tired after having just a few carbs (even 15g) and exhibit other signs of a glucose spike (e.g. heart races, dry eyes, etc). I have occassionally checked my blood sugar to confirm a spike, then keep checking to make sure my glucose levels fall back down (\~100) about 1-2hr later, which tells me I have a delayed insulin response. I cannot wear a CGM because I developed an adhesive allergy during my first pregnancy. My primary care doctor says she isn't concerned and would not consider me to be in the prediabetic category, but I know something is abnormal about my metabolic health so I've scheduled an endocronologist appointment myself (first available appt is in Feb 2026). I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience as I've love to get some inspiration and learn from this community on ways to prevent full-blown diabetes.

2. u/PAVibing [score=1, created=2025-11-14T04:52:59]: Since you had GDM you and your offspring have ~50% chance of developing DM later in life. The 2 biggest things you can do to prevent or delay diabetes is 1) lose 5-7% of your current weight and 2) be active for 150 minutes per week. I have run many CDC Prevent T2 cohorts and participants have been successful with those 2 lifestyle changes.
