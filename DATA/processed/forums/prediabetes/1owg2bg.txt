I have an insulin dependent intellectually handicapped brother. His CGM kept going off low and I kept waking him up for snacks. Then all he did was slightly adjust position and it shot up almost to 300 and I ended up having to give him more insulin next morning. Since then honestly on this one sub I’ve seen dozens of folks in a panic over low night readings only to discover it was just the sensor. Since it’s waking you up anyway, just do a finger stick. More than likely it will say you’re fine.

Many people have [reversed PCOS with fasting](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/fasting-q-a-with-megan-ramos-pms-pcos-vitamin-d/id1593883196?i=1000672201657).

Ive been Prediabetic since January and on Metformin just to assist in lowering my A1C (along with other life style changes). It sounds like you are double checking readings from your cgm but I recently switched from the Dexcom stelo CGM to the libre and my libre readings are averaging about 15 mg/dl lower than the Dexcom. I had to turn off all the alerts on the libre becausethey were scaring the s*** out of me at night. How's your diet? Have you tried eating a snack before bed?
