There's still carbs, there's just also fiber added--not that you can't eat them but something to be aware of especially with a lot of big "0/1/5 net carbs!" labels being popular right now. I'd personally do the chicken without the breading. I like baking or pan frying chicken with 1-2 servings of the Kinders buttery buffalo sauce, which has 1 carb per serving. Something else I'd do is sub the ranch for greek yogurt with a packet of the ranch seasoning power mixed in. Slightly less carbs and more protein, and I personally prefer the thicker texture.
2. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=3, created=2025-11-13T19:58:04]: IANYD. I don't work off numbers at all, but I do try to eat whole foods. I would add an avocado/guac and some salsa and lime, and I would delete the tortilla, except as an occasional treat. And unless I really loved the breading, I'd have plain chicken strips. You can't count numbers at every meal, or at least I can't. It's a lot easier to develop general strategies.
3. u/East_Collection_5672 [score=3, created=2025-11-13T19:48:44]: I just checked this meal in the Glucospike Ai food coach app. It says, “Try using grilled chicken instead to cut calories and boost healthiness. Keep up the good work!”
4. u/brochelarch [score=2, created=2025-11-14T03:41:11]: Id turn it in to a taco bowl and lose the tortilla. Add rices cauliflower for the base with black beans for more fiber, avocado for healthy fats, and more veg like peppers and sliced radish. Swap out breaded chicken for grilled or baked.

6. u/aprilmofo [score=1, created=2025-11-13T21:43:48]: Everyone is different but this probably wouldn’t affect me much. Testing blood levels after eating things is the surest way to know what works and doesn’t for you. I’ve seen so many people say one thing spikes them so high and others have little to no response. While suggestions were helpful, my CGM (with back up checks now and then with a finger tester) and experimenting with foods were the best and quickest way I figured out what to eat.
7. u/Bryllant [score=1, created=2025-11-14T08:39:06]: I would use a lettuce wrap instead of tortillas
8. u/Forever-Much [score=1, created=2025-11-14T11:05:42]: What is the chicken breaded with?? I would probably just grill it and spice it up some. How many carbs and fat are in the light ranch dressing?? The regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing only has 1 carb but 13 g of fat and 2 are saturated. I would use an actual green lettuce lol. And then choose a fat free cheddar. This is just what I would do. I’ve just recently been diagnosed with pre diabetes and am still learning. So I would also double check everything I mentioned before I actually did it😂😂 If I’m wrong on anything that anyone notices please let me know!!
9. u/CapriKitzinger [score=-1, created=2025-11-13T20:30:37]: The processed food. Throw out the tortilla of any kind. Ditch the gross preservative and chemical filled ranch. Don’t eat anything breaded.
10. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=0, created=2025-11-13T20:02:29]: I would ditch the breading, maybe replace with crumbled pork rinds which have zero carbs. Check the ranch dressing label for carbs, it likely has added sugar. Check your blood sugar 90-120 minutes after you finish eating if you can.
