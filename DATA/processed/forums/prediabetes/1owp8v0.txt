===============================================================================

I do double check and usually its lower than the alarm says. Found out 2 months back i am hypoglycemic. Never realized how many times a day it gets low till now, sometimes I dont even notice till I get dizzy and start to fall.

In fact, the lower I am, the better I feel. That’s just me though. Are you on meds? Have you checked this against a finger prick?

Same for my cgm I pay out of pocket for them. No when I snack I barely hit 100 nomatter what it is. Ive even drank a soda which ik is a no no it doesn't raise my sugar over 100 so I have been struggling just to keep it up to make it through the day.
