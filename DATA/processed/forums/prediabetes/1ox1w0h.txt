===============================================================================

I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic in October 2024 with A1C at 5.7. I kinda ignored it and didn't take it seriously. Did another blood test as part of routine annual exam in May 2025 and my A1C was at 5.9. That concerned me and I started making some changes to my lifestyle. I wanted to make lifestyle changes instead of making changes that I can't stick to. I got 3 months supply of Stelo CGM and started monitoring how my body reacts to food I eat. Reduced carbs (missed rice :-() and increased protein intake. Use apps like Cronometer, GlucospikeAI to keep track of what I am eating and macro nutrients. Not a gym person but started hitting gym about 2-3 times a week doing strength training. There are weeks where I was not consistent. :-( but pushed myself to go to gym. If I can get to the gym, I really enjoyed the workout and how my body felt afterwards but its the fact that I needed to get off the couch which was a problem. Tried to sleep better but failed miserably because of my non-stop work travel. I sleep well when I am home which is about 50% of the time. Was able to manage stress overall. Here is the bad part - As far as food good, I ended up taking too much nuts such as almonds, walnuts and cashews. I also had avacado almost everyday. I did a blood test this week, the good news is that my A1c is at 5.3!! Yay!! But my LDL, non-hdl cholesterol, total cholesterol shot up. Interestingly, my HDL is all time high as well. Met with my doc this morning - she mentioned that my ASCVD (cardiac) risk score has increased and its at 5. Never heard of this before. She advised me to adjust my diet to keep ldl and cholesterol in control. Recommended to do another blood work in 3 months to see where I stand - she mentioned if the ldl and total cholesterol come back in range, she will have to prescribe cholesterol medication - which I am not a big fan of. Looks like I need to start thinking about moderation of my cholesterol intake. Sharing as others could benefit from my experience. Will report back in months.

It's SF that contributes to LDL. Its great that you are hitting the gym, your muscles will do a great job of acting as supplemental glucose stores. That said, remember to fuel them with protein &amp; complex carbs. In the absence of carbs, your cortisol levels will be high, which may also keep your glucose levels up. And, it's the combo effect of protein + carbs that will help you gain those muscles. Keep up the good work!
2. u/SuzMichell [score=2, created=2025-11-14T15:27:13]: The healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in nuts help lower bad cholesterol levels. Several studies have shown that daily avocado consumption can lead to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. One study found that a moderate-fat diet that included one avocado a day was more effective at lowering LDL than diets with moderate-fat but no avocado or a low-fat diet. Adding avocados to a diet can significantly decrease total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. I eat nuts and avocados every day because they contain healthy fats and are a good way of keeping calorie intake up which is difficult when I can’t eat carbs.

A good starting point is a long conversation with Google AI or similar. Explain what you are doing and considering doing to the bot as well as why and what your goals are. Then use the bot's advice as a starting point for research. It will tell you things like even the American Diabetes Association advises even diabetics to make 25% of main meals starchy vegetables like lentils, beans and potatoes to PROMOTE better glucose control. The expert guidance is balance. Total avoidance is only for white bread, sugar, transfats and highly processed foods. If you go on a statin, ask for Pravastatin. It is the only one that does not raise blood sugar. Consider "early time restricted eating. ". It is supposed to be great for reducing insulin resistance. It means no food after 3 pm. Sounds terrible but I'm loving it, except for the weight loss. The bot advised me to add olive oil and/or nut butters and/or full fat dairy to a lot of things to pack in the calories. And to eat even more nuts than I already do. I see the dietician in a few weeks. It was a battle to get my insurance to agree to pay, but my HOMA-IR score and cooperation from my PCP carried the day once I got to speak to a supervisor.
