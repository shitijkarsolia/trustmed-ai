===============================================================================

One year ago my A1C was 6.9 and I freaked out. When I look back, it was 5.5 in 2001 and then 6.1 in 2023 and no one mentioned it. This year, I've lost weight and really watched my carbs (I once ate keto which was helpful in understanding carbs) and got it down to 6.3 this summer. That was pretty exciting and I most certainly took it as a license to eat more bread. I don't really eat lots of sweets, but love carbs. So here I am again, back up to 6.6 as of yesterday. I really think a CGM would be useful. My doc last year had prescribed the Freestyle Libra 3, but I never used it b/c the whole thing made me anxious. I'm ready now and I figured I'd try a Dexcom Stelo b/c it works with my Apple Watch, but it looks like lots of folks don't like them on this sub? Is it really that bad that it's only updating every 15 mins for someone like me? I don't think I need alarms right now, either. Btw, 52f and Type2 runs on my dad's side. He's had it for maybe 20 yrs, very well controlled at 82 yrs old. I'd really like to not end up T2 and I've proven to myself that I can get my A1C down through diet -- but I feel like a CGM would help me understand what causes my spikes as I try to get it back down again.

For example, what I thought was a super healthy meal of oatmeal and fruit every day actually caused such a severe spike compared to potatoes, bacon, and avocado. Therefore, i've severely limited oats and incorporated a more savory breakfast without the calories or spikes. Plus you can see what affects your body specifically, like for me, sweet potatoes are negligible, and they've now become my favorite food. I signed up for Stelo Dexcom's subscription service off their website for 3 months and then after deciding I wanted to keep using CGM long term I bought the sensors off ebay for 1/3 cost. I've never had issues with any sensors, though, and I would hope that if I would call about a non working sensor stello would honor it because they don't know where I bought it from but i'm not sure. I'm going to at least wear these monitors for another six months until I can figure out how to get my prediabetes glucose in control, which is not currently in control even though taking Jardiance and metformin.

3. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=3, created=2025-11-14T13:44:48]: I've had 4 Stelos, no issues with them for me. FWIW: Once you have some insulin resistance, and then get your A1C back down to normal via diet, you cannot go back to your old carb-heavy diet or your A1C will go back up again, as you noticed.
4. u/BlissCrafter [score=3, created=2025-11-14T14:21:36]: It’s not a bad thing. Know that in general they tend to be slightly inaccurate, usually high. And that at night in particular you may see some dramatic lows that aren’t real. They can malfunction significantly from bed pressure. If you see any crazy highs or lows, double check with a finger stick before taking action. Otherwise they’ll give you a good general insight on how you’re doing and serve as a reminder to stay away from the carbs.
5. u/Busy-Matter-1242 [score=3, created=2025-11-14T14:50:50]: I lost 25 lbs with Stelo. I use ChatGPT to ask questions when it spikes. Useful to get supplement recommendations. So you become super educated and in control of your health. You will learn how the liver has a role, and sleep and stress. I was using Berberine for a while for liver sugar but don’t need it now. I just ordered new 3 month Stelo order.
6. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T13:48:49]: A CGM is useful for all the reasons you said - as long as you can interpret the data without freaking out. Check out some of Dr. Jason Fung's videos. He recommends fasting. **It's completely free** (saves money, in fact), and helps many people reverse prediabetes and even T2D.
7. u/NotDiabeticDad [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:06:26]: I'm not prediabetic anymore because I got on a CGM. But I can confidently say it would have been a waste of money if I didn't get the guidance on how to understand the data. See if your insurance covers a nutritionist. Also look for diabetes reversal programs. I joined one called Heald or maybe it's iheald for 50$ a month and it has people working with me solving problems and helping me create plans. Lower your blood sugar is an intangible problem. Have fiber before every meal or have a set sleep routine is tangible. Right now my blood sugar is in the 80s from dinner test an hour after eating.
8. u/Salt-Ad-8022 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T13:39:40]: I’m surprised you weren’t already diagnosed with T2 with a 6.6 A1C. That’s very high, and likely diabetic territory already:(
