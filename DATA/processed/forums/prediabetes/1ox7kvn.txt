I just found out about these and bought some. What do you guys think ? I’m only having about 3 a week for a snack. And only one a day!

2. u/Flea-Surgeon [score=5, created=2025-11-14T13:31:31]: There isn't anything harmful in them by the look of it. In fact, there doesn't appear to be much of anything at all in them lol. Are they good? I'm not sure they're available in the UK?

4. u/paradisemukbangpls [score=3, created=2025-11-14T15:12:11]: I eat these but the korean brand (they’re a popular diet food, and Konjac is a staple in lots of Asians cuisines — I’m Asian) They don’t impact my blood sugar since it’s just sugar alcohol. But to be safe I always eat this as dessert after a full meal with fiber (vegetables , whole grain etc) to slow digestion
5. u/Joshlo777 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T16:54:45]: Sugar alcohols helped me a lot to lose weight and reverse my prediabetes. However, more recent evidence showing an association with heart attack and stroke led me to quit altogether. Now I just eat the occasional sugary treat, and make sure to get lots of excercise.

Looks like you got sucked in by the “0g sugar” and didn’t pay close attention to the details: it still has 15g of carbs! and only 1g fiber - no protein, no fats. There are far, far better snacks - string cheese, some nuts, even a small apple. A small apple has similar carbs but also contains some fiber, and it’s a real food - and it would hit your bloodstream slower because it takes more time to actually eat and digest it, vs. the liquified goo in the pouch which hits your bloodstream pretty much immediately.
7. u/Tony_Cheese_ [score=1, created=2025-11-14T13:43:13]: Im not a doctor and you should talk to one for a more accurate answer, but the internet says 10-15g of sugar alcohol per day is okay.
8. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=-6, created=2025-11-14T13:46:41]: IANAD/IANYD. If you are trying to reverse prediabetes, you should not snack, and you should try to get rid of your sweet tooth. &gt; What do you guys think ? I think that this is not a healthy food for you.
