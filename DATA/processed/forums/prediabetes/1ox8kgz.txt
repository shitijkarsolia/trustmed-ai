===============================================================================

A year ago, my PCP did routine bloodwork and told me I was slightly into prediabetes. Over the year, I lost some weight and have been more careful about sugar consumption. I also have an endocrinologist who just did bloodwork, which I thought would include A1C, but did not. However, my glucose level came back at 98, within a normal range of 65-139. Does that mean I am no longer in a prediabetes place? Or is the glucose result meaningless, and I need to contact my PCP and have further bloodwork? Thank you from the panic zone.

Any one of the 3 makes you prediabetic by their definition. The definition is arbitrary and recent; it's different in other countries. There was no such disease 20 years ago. But it's a good wakeup call to start doing something about your glucose control. So, fasting glucose isn't meaningless. But it being in the green doesn't mean you are not prediabetic. Either of the other 2 indicators could mean you are prediabetic. And you can be okay on all three and still have insulin resistance, which I'll explain later. A1C is a rough guide to your average glucose level. Fasting glucose is how low your glucose goes when there's no food feeding glucose into the blood stream. And the glucose tolerance test is how well your body brings glucose back down when hit with a big glucose challenge. Any one of the three could be off while the other two are okay. Your body is always trying to keep glucose within a certain range, producing insulin to try to force glucose into the muscles, fat and liver when glucose in the blood is high. Another good thing to test is fasting insulin. You can have acceptable glucose numbers and still not be totally healthy in the glucose department if you are achieving those low glucose numbers by overproducing insulin. Get a fasting glucose and a fasting insulin on the same blood sample and check for insulin resistance by plugging those two numbers into a HOMA-IR calculator (google it). i got my A1C down to 5.6 but then found out my HOMA-IR score is 4.8 which is bad. Should be 2.9 or under and ideally close to 1.0. I have some work to do! Fasting insulin gives a baseline as to how high your insulin is when there is no glucose challenge from food recently (mine is 22.7 -- way too high). HOMA-IR is based on multiplying fasting insulin by fasting glucose and dividing by a constant, so it is getting at how much insulin it took your body to hold your glucose down to the level seen in the blood sample. See [https://www.nesaz.com/understanding-your-insulin-resistance-score-homa-ir-score/](https://www.nesaz.com/understanding-your-insulin-resistance-score-homa-ir-score/) If insulin demand is chronically high, that's bad.

That single glucose reading just tells you what your blood sugar was at that exact moment, but the A1C shows your average over 2–3 months, which is how prediabetes is actually diagnosed. My doctor checks mine every 6–9 months to track it. Just call your PCP and ask for an A1C test so you can stop worrying and actually know where you stand.
