===============================================================================

I'm in college and I've developed super bad health anxiety (due to being sick for like a month straight + being away from home) and have been having a bunch of labs done + bought a glucometer. Anyways it's gotten better but when they checked my fasting blood sugar, (i had crippling anxiety, like bpm reaching 130s, + got like 2 hours of sleep), it was 117. Just to rule out prediabetes, they did an A1c, and it came back at a 5.1. The other day, they checked blood sugar again in urgent care for some other reasons, it was a 105 (had lunch 4 hours before (50 g of refined carbs), + was drinking full sugar liquid iv before checking). Today morning, i decided to check my fasting again (around 45 mins after waking up) , and it was 112?? Huh?? I'm so confused. I tested again 2 times, and each time it went down by like 4 till it reached 104. And then I ate brunch which was pita bread, falafal, grilled veggies, and like 1/3 cup rice, and checked 2 hours later and the glucometer said my blood sugar was 117. Anyways what is going on, am i prediabetic? Help me please.

What you’re seeing can happen from anxiety, poor sleep etc. All of those can raise fasting glucose temporarily because of cortisol and adrenaline. Your A1C of 5.1 shows your overall average is completely normal. What I would suggest is to monitor your fasting glucose and your post-meal numbers over the next couple of weeks. Avoid sugar and refined carbs so you can see what your true baseline is without noise. Wait for 30 minutes before checking. In someone with normal glucose regulation, fasting is usually under 100. So you may be borderline prediabetic, or this could simply be stress-related. If your numbers still run high once your stress settles and sleep improves, then a lifestyle shift helps a lot. That means resistance training 3 days a week to build muscle, and fasted cardio 5 days a week if you can manage it. Muscle improves glucose handling even without insulin, and consistent activity brings fasting numbers down quickly.

But he didn’t have anxiety. That was just how his mind (and doctors) interpreted the sensation of his heart racing. He ACTUALLY has a sympathetic nervous system disorder. A beta blocker fixes his racing heart. He’s be just Netflix and chillin and his heart rate would just climb. He could feel it. You need an Apple Watch and a cardiologist and a neurologist. Research this possibility. You don’t need psych meds if you have what he has. They did nothing!! The cortisol from your nervous system issue is causing your glucose spikes. Bark up the right tree. See a cardiologist and neurologist. Search or sympathetic / para sympathetic nervous system disorders.

Poor sleep, stress, and various hormonal things that happen right when you wake up can affect your blood glucose. If you want to, you can try testing your fasting glucose a few hours after waking up, but the low A1C strongly suggests that whatever your average blood sugar is, it’s significantly lower than would be concerning and you are very unlikely to have prediabetes. Also, home blood glucose monitors can be inaccurate. I would just focus on reducing stress, eating healthy, and exercising (in other words, the things that really every person should be doing to improve their health). Stop checking your blood sugar, if it’s just giving you anxiety it’ll do more harm than good lol. Edit: also, I am not a doctor. Talk to your doctor and they can probably help assuage your concerns or figure out if something’s up
