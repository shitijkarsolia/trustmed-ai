===============================================================================

I have been prediabetic for a year. A1C 5.8 down to 5.3. Lipids best they've ever been. Went from BMI of 128 to 122. Interventions included improved sleep, timing walks to meals, and following a low carb and high fiber diet plus restricting fats to unsaturated. Doctor referred me to a dietician when I asked for help stopping the weight loss. She is trying to get me to double carb intake from 100 g daily to 200 g daily. I feel so nervous about it, but she is insisting it won't impact my A1C and will be better for me. Anyone else experienced this? What was the outcome if you tried it?

I think what is more important than low-carb is to eat nutrient-rich carbs - not empty calories. Not all carbs are created equal. The carbs you get from a serving of acorn squash is going to be much better for you than the same amount of carbs from, say, white rice. So perhaps consider slowly adding some more healthy carbs - veggies and fruits - back into your diet and see how it goes. You might be pleasantly surprised.

It looks like she’s adding more calories, which is fine, but make sure to focus on the quality of the carbs and ensure they are complex carbs. If you’re unsure, you can scan your meals with the glucospike AI app, and it will tell you whether they might spike your glucose or not. If the carbs aren’t ideal, you can highlight this and inform your dietician. Also, Can you DM me dietician contact details, I am also looking for one.

5. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=0, created=2025-11-14T18:51:00]: Just wanted to clarify something here regarding fats, did you eliminate all other fats except unsaturated? Or is it the opposite, you eliminated unsaturated fat, but kept other fats?
6. u/CliffsideJim [score=-1, created=2025-11-14T21:11:24]: I have been having a similar conversation with Google AI tonight. I suggest you do the same. Google AI had this to say when I asked about starchy vegetables ( I have lost 15 pounds on a very low carb diet and did not need to. My BMI is now 21.3. Eating as much as I can, all healthy stuff.) Pay particular attention to the last paragraph: "A **starchy vegetable** is a vegetable that contains a higher amount of starch (a type of complex carbohydrate) and calories compared to non-starchy vegetables. They provide energy and are excellent sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Common examples of starchy vegetables include: * **Potatoes** (white and sweet varieties) * **Corn** * **Peas** (green peas and lima beans) * **Winter Squashes** (acorn, butternut, and pumpkin) * **Legumes** (dried beans, lentils, and chickpeas are often grouped with starchy vegetables in dietary guidelines) * **Root vegetables** like yams, parsnips, and cassava While healthy, starchy vegetables have a greater impact on blood sugar levels than non-starchy vegetables due to their higher carbohydrate content. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) generally recommends that starchy foods make up about a quarter of your plate at main meals to help manage blood glucose levels. For reference, non-starchy vegetables include options like broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini. " So the ADA says 1/4 of your plate at main meals should be starchy vegetables to HELP manage blood glucose levels, even though they send glucose up in the short run. I did not know this and it kinda throws me for a loop. It was a long conversation with Google AI. The general conclusion from the bot was I needed to judiciously add back some whole grain carbs and really hit the fats hard -- nut butters, nuts, olive oil on everything, cheese, full fat dairy. And see a dietician and do whatever they say. The bot was much more concerned about my HOMA-IR score than my A1C and heartily endorsed early time restricted eating and exercise, both aerobic and resistance type. It suggested a high protien meal right after resistance exercise. It siezed on the fact that my grandmother got diabetes in old age, and was also tall and skinny like me, as evidence of a genetic predisposition to non-obese insulin resistance and said that was a high risk factor for diabetes and CV disease. So, talk to Google AI and lay out all the facts, including the advice your considering and the anxieties you have about it, along with any relevant background info. Of course, you never rely on a bot without getting authoritative corroboration. But, it's interesting and nothing beats a bot for patient listening. It also churns out lots of links to relevant scientific articles as a sidebar to the conversation you're having.,
