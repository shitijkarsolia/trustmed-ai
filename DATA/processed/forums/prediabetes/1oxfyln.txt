===============================================================================

Feeling a bit defeated. My A1C levels have never been amazing, but since giving birth Feb 2024 they have been higher than I'd like. I had a big spike after birth (I suspect I had geriatric diabetes). Then it went down. I've lost 70+ lbs since then and am 140 now (lower than I've been in 15 years), yet I'm still at the low end of prediabetes. I watch my carb intake, walk a lot. Any tips would be appreciated! Note I also have hypothyroidism (I'm medicated and numbers are in range). Nov 2025 - 5.7 March 2025 - 5.7 Oct 2024 - 5.6 June 2024 - 5.5 March 2024 - 6 2022- 5.0

Since then my A1C has been 5.7-6.0, when I never had a problem with my A1C prior to pregnancy. I do have family history though, so I guess it’s possible this was just going to happen once I hit my 30s and it happened to align with the timing of my pregnancy. I’m a healthy weight, workout 6 days a week, eat healthy, etc..it’s pretty frustrating to try to manage actually

I can tell you more about all the work I'm doing but if you make one change eat a huge salad that leaves you annoyed with having to eat so much before every meal.

But if you have hypothyroid but you're still struggling with a1c despite your thyroid levels being normal, you may want to get a more in-depth look at your thyroid levels. Most docs will just look at TSH &amp; T4, but if your T3 is off (common in hypothyroid) it can trigger insulin resistance. Most people are medicated for hypothyroid w/ levothyroxine which is t4, so t3 levels can still be low, and t3 plays a role in glucose metabolism. Maybe this is playing a factor for you? Like I said, I don't know much about this. I'm hypothyroid also, so it's just something I've read and made note of it.
