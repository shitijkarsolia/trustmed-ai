===============================================================================

I am a thin type 2 and though I knew it is a way different process, I am now seeing that it's hard to compare apples and oranges. Are there any normal weight type 2s out there who can share their treatment plans, successes, issues...?

2. u/Calm_Efficiency_9089 [score=1, created=2025-08-20T19:23:17]: I am, 41F. I was just diagnosed in May. I’d lost weight upon diagnosis and weighed 116lbs. I’m up to 120 now. Going to try and add the other 6 lbs back in muscle. Meds I was given kept sending me hypo. The results from my C peptide and antibodies came back. Doctor hasn’t called yet but I’m pretty sure they look negative for type 1. Meds seem okay now as the were reduced. I still hypos every now and again— I have a continous glucose monitor. I’m reducing carbs but I don’t want to lose weight— quite the opposite because I actually want to gain. I‘m working with a nutritionist twice weekly via Berry Street.
3. u/Snoozinsioux [score=1, created=2025-08-19T12:41:38]: I always tell people to request their doctors test them for type 1; I know more than one adult that was misdiagnosed and pretty sick. Also, it’s less about weight and more about muscle and fat. You can be low weight and have a higher than ideal amount of body fat and low amount of muscle or the other way around. I was around 160 when I was dx at 19…but I’m 5’1, so I was still over weight. Most people that struggle with their numbers at lower weight typically need to increase muscle.
4. u/ChaiTeaLatte13 [score=2, created=2025-08-18T07:35:01]: I was 155lbs when diagnosed and now 125lbs. I had an issue of balancing a lower a1c with dramatically dropping weight. My a1c was 13.8% at diagnosis so I was shook. I got to a 4.9% a1c in less than a year but I was down to 117lbs and didn’t look good at all. My a1c was so high at diagnosis but my starting weight was only slightly above average, so it was hard to figure out what to do. I introduced some more carbs back into my diet so my a1c climbed to 5.2% but I feel much better at 125lbs. It’s a weird balance of wanting a stellar a1c but having to keep or actively put weight on, and this is very different than the typical advice I see for type 2.
5. u/K9CatSprinkles [score=1, created=2025-08-18T05:32:13]: When diagnosed prediabetic I was 48kg I’m 5’1 and was 40 yrs old. I’ve started a high protein diet and strength training. Im currently training twice a week and hoping to get up to 3. I’m now hovering between 41-40kg. I’m hoping my next test in sept will have a positive result and my numbers have come down. My bmi is around 18.
6. u/Own-Push5775 [score=3, created=2025-08-18T00:34:52]: Life long T2 discovered as a teenager and rail thin. Stayed thin until 30s, then gained but stayed light weight. T2 is not always caused by lifestyle choices. I managed BG by diet control. Look up the glycemic index of foods and adjust based on that. Sequence of eating had a large impact (eat carbs after protein). There are some great videos on u tube about what works. Too much info to write here. It worked until it didn't. Had to add meds in my 50s. Good luck.
7. u/Professional_Tip_867 [score=3, created=2025-08-17T19:35:45]: I got a physical part time job, that I do about 5 hours a day 3x a week. I call it paid exercise. it really has helped to keep the bg under control. I am not “thin” , but rather a normal BMI
8. u/ShopNerd [score=2, created=2025-08-17T18:32:46]: Diagnosed a few months ago at 30, weighing maybe 180 lbs, fairly fit and active so it was very confusing. I assume maybe I'm a type 1.5 but can't be sure. I've evened out on weight loss now that my sugar levels are in check so thats been nice. I know that the usual focus for type 2's is weight loss to help get closer to remission but since that would be very difficult to lose more weight I've focused more on muscle gain. I've heard that having more muscle mass allows for more sugar absorption so I figure thats my route to better control. Plus it never hurts to be a bit bulkier and stronger especially in my career so thats a bonus
9. u/kewissman [score=3, created=2025-08-17T18:04:08]: 71; 5’ 11”, 170-175 pounds, 16-17% body fat. Type 2 for at least 15 years. Need full dose Metformin, full dose Jardiance, and mid dose Trulicity to keep my A1c in the low 7s. Strength training or cardio 4 times a week. I don’t eat crazy stupid but when I’m feeling like a pizza I’m going for it…
10. u/AsapGnocci [score=3, created=2025-08-17T17:35:09]: I feel ya! I was diagnosed type 2 in my late 20s at peak fitness level with a decade of working as a PT and regularly exercising at the time. It really is discouraging having to go straight to meds and insulin because diet and exercise were not contributing to diagnoses. Well actually my diet wasn't crazy healthy but nothing out of the ordinary for the average mid 20yo. Rarely drank alcohol and never smoked either.. just genetics and bad luck for me
