===============================================================================

I am on the path of healing my blood sugar. I have lost a lot of weight but still on the path of reversing insulin resistance or managing it without meds. In the morning it’s around 10 to 12 mmol/L between 8am and 11am. If I workout it gets up to 12-15! Especially if it’s circuit weighttraining so it’s a lot of sweat &amp; heavy breathing which is great but it spikes my blood sugar. If I sleep these numbers get better but I had a little too much fun this summer 😢 so I’m on my way back to balancing it all. When I sleep it’s anywhere from 8ish to 9ish mmol/L between 7am and 11am with many 5’s to 7’s before 7am. But when I don’t sleep well and eat after 9pm it’s all above 10 in the mornings and even up to 14 mmol/L. So… I am on the path to heal this with sleep &amp; nutrition. My plan: sleep at 10:30pm/ 11pm at the latest and wake up around 7:30 or 8 am. Eat between 12 pm and 7:30ish pm. My spikes and high blood sugars are always in the morning and when I workout it always increases especially if I’m already above 11 mmol/L Please share tips or just encouragement

When do you eat related to waking in the morning and what is on the menu over the course of the day in terms of carbs, fats and protein? Read these to see why I ask: * [I Ate Nothing!

Heavy exercise will spike blood sugar as you body relases glucose because your muscles need energy. However, your blood sugar levels should come down afterwards. You may also be fasting too long. Women in particular, up to 30%, can experience a detrimental effect to blood sugar control while fasting. I was doing 8:16 intermittent fasting before I was diagnosed with a 14.2 A1c.

5. u/Sudoku-Addict [score=4, created=2025-08-19T07:07:06]: When I do moderate cardio on the treadmill or elliptical, I see a very small rise in BS. When I hour and mow the lawn for 1-2 hours it is more prominent. Rises quickly and recedes quickly. I attribute it to your body seeing that your muscles need energy. Which is the way it’s supposed to work. Lifting weights might be expected to see BS spike.
