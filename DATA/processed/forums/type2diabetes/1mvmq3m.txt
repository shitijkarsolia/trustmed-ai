===============================================================================

I share this snapshot from Libre-3+ as an exemplar for T2D folks wondering about BS spiking after working out. This is from just over 2 hours vigorous weed whacking some heavy grass and weeds. This is a bit higher than normal for me, but then so were the weeds! Baseline BS was around 80, with peak BS about 128. I had been fasting about 14 hours when I started, other than a couple coffees with heavy cream. I did not hydrate during exercise. Anyway, nothing unusual here, just wanted to share image of how exercise alone may raise BS. Experiences will vary.
