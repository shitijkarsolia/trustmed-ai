Hi, everyone! As usual, I am posting in regard to my Father— so him &amp; I were at Walmart picking up his Jardiance script. He has been prescribed 60 tablets per month for the past year, and paid $45. Well, they texted him saying it was going to be $1.9k. We ask and they say the same price. She ran it through for 30 days and it was $45, so thankfully, had her fill that… since my dad was about to say, “screw it I won’t take it.” But like, wtf? I’ve had my fair share of issues with insurance and prescriptions but, I’d think this one would be covered… what do you guys think??

Insurance formularies expect and prior approvals use those formats. Because it is more costly to two pills per day rather than one is the reason for a rejection.
