===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with diabetes 3 weeks ago after being admitted to hospital after a routine blood test showed A1C at 13% and then also detected very high level ketones (3.1) in blood. I didn't go into DKA (normal PH). I was put on a drip to lower ketones and glucose in blood, then discharged home. Then I saw the Diabetes team in clinic 2 days later and I was started on basal–bolus insulin. The team explained I very likely had type 1 / LADA. I suggested the possibility of type 2 because of a very strong family history but they said this was incredibly unlikely because of the ketones in my blood and my profile. But they ordered a full panel of antibodies to rule out - and they've all come back negative. Now they have said they have ruled out type 1 and I have type 2. What confuses me is the ketone levels in my blood. I thought ketosis and risk of DKA usually pointed more strongly to type 1. I’ve been reading a bit about ketosis-prone type 2 (sometimes called Flatbush diabetes), and I wondered if anyone here has experience with this? The team said I can't have this because I'm not of the demographic that has ketone-prone type 2/ flatbush - but then also couldn't answer why my ketones in my blood were so high with a type 2 diagnosis. Some details: * Female, Age 34, lean body type, active, but strong family history of type 2 on my father’s side. Always knew I'd eventually get type 2 but shocked at an a1c of 13%, and the presence of ketones. * Needed insulin from diagnosis, but now moving to add metformin. * Ratios currently very insulin resistant for carbs, despite being lean. I'm only on 5units Lantus at night which keeps me steady overnight at 6mmol, but my insulin to carb ratio is 1:3 at breakfast, and 1:5 at lunch (even less on non-exercise days). * Ketones were present on diagnosis (close to DKA). Has anyone here had a similar experience? If you were ketosis-prone T2, were you eventually able to come off insulin, or reduce it significantly? Did your doctors run a C-peptide test to guide the diagnosis? I requested a fasting c-peptide but they declined to do this. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and trying to understand, so any insights or personal stories would really help.

Well my A1C recently got up to 8.4 even after doubling my dose of Metformin. My doctor put me on Jardience in addition to the Metformin. Within a week, I couldn't event keep down water . My husband took me to the emergency room and from there I was admitted to the ICU with DKA. I talked my doctor about LADA, but he wants me to try Monjourna first before he gives me the C-Peptide test. I will start the the Monjourna this weekend and give it a try, but I'm beginning to strongly suspect I was misdiagnosed with Type 2 all those years ago and actually have LADA. I should mentioned that I have been using the Keto diet to help control my blood sugar, so I wasn't surprised there were some ketones in my blood test but DKA is a whole new level of hell. If your doctor refuses to run a C-peptide test, I would honestly find a new doctor.
