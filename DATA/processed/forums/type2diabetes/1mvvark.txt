Title: I read CGMs have a 10% difference than finger sticks. Are CGMs 10% higher or lower than a finger stick reading?

Sometimes the difference is negligible (rarely) during a post meal spike I’ve seen the difference as high as 40 points higher.

When lab results come back compare results. My sticks and CGM are within 2% (often identical) of the lab. (CGMs could be +/- more if blood glucose is not stable because are about 5 minutes delayed). I am a life long T2, tightly control my BG and have used glucose testers and CGMs from the major suppliers. I use insulin both inhaled and by injection therefore, accuracy is necessary for correct dosage. I could write a book about my experiences of T2 and treatments. Over the years, I've used maybe 10 manufacturers of glucose meters. Often found large differences in reported levels, before confirming who was the best. Some things I discovered: the weekly CGM designs (such as Dexcom and Abbott) share some similar problems. Social media has thousands of posts and discussions or rants but still many people are aware or understand the limitations and device issues. Often there has been a wide variance between both accuracy and repeatability when switching to the next sensor. Where they are installed (even inches different), skin condition and alignment have impacted the results and life of the sensors. Often the 1st 24 to 48 and sometimes the last 24 hours of the sensor will be unreliable. If the sensor had less than 30 days remaining (expiration date), these units gave me the most errors and failures (Bluetooth connection, accuracy, early ending and more). The above issues are mostly due to the devices design and therefore unavoidable. I have software that allows using more than one sensor at the same time. This is how I discovered the above issues. Unfortunately, most users are unaware but one day will experience them and wonder why. When I saw unexpected swings, (no causing reason) or suspect numbers, I ignored, but watch or use a finger test to verify. I have found acceptable devices and good solutions. Today, I use a Dexcom G7 as my 2nd (backup) CGM because it is calibratable (Libres are not). My primary CGM is an Eversense 365 because it doesn't have the above issues and works great for a whole year. I use a Contour Next One glucose meter and the Eversense 365 CGM because I have found them to be far superior (more accurate) than all others.

6. u/Zeus783 [score=1, created=2025-08-20T18:02:49]: The incongruence could be either way. If your CGM has a 10% margin that could be + or -. Bear in mind a finger prick is subject to the same rule. Each machine has their own margin of error range (varies according to the maker/machine) although I suspect what you are referring to is the MARD of your own CGM specifically. You can't really compare that to the MARD of the manual glucose monitor which is subject to the same rule. They are guidelines. For instance let's say that both your CGM and manual glucose monitor have a MARD of 10% (even number for commodity). CGM gives a reading of 6.0. +/- 10% Manual GM 6.0. +/-10% I picked even numbers to make it easier to understand. Let's say that MARD of the CGM is the max i.e. 10% up and that the MARD of the manual is 10% down... The real readings in this specific case would be : CGM. 6.6. - Manual 5.4 In that case the discrepancy between both machines is way over 10% as they're both within they're legit MARD which went to different directions. So you can't really say the incongruence between CGM and finger test is 10% Obvoilsy it could be... Hope that made sense. 😎
7. u/325_WII4M [score=2, created=2025-08-20T17:53:18]: I've been using the Dexcom G7 CGM, and honestly, my readings are about 10% higher on the high side compared to finger sticks. On the low end, they’re pretty much spot on. I'm still getting used to the real time thing because with finger sticks, you just got that final number when it was time to check bs. But with the CGM, you can watch your blood sugar go up and down, which is cool but also kind of feels like it takes forever to settle on a final number. Checking it more often is nice, but sometimes it feels like it just drags on, at least that's the way it seems to me. Haven't had A1C since I started using CGM 15 days ago.
8. u/vauss88 [score=1, created=2025-08-20T17:11:17]: My cgm that I have used for the last 8 months generally seems to run lower on the A1C equivalent by about 4 tenths. For example, if the cgm is registering 6.6, my blood A1c is 7.0. This has been consistent for last three blood tests. So that is about 6 percent or so lower. Edit: that is with a freestyle libre 3+.
