I always start meal tracking, but stop after a few weeks. How do you guys stay consistent?

I've been dealing with food tracking for a while and I've been analyzing reasons why I and other people fail and how to make it more sustainable on the long run. So I think I can share and perhaps be a bit helpful! So, I found that there are a few keys to better sustainability. The first and the most basic one is the reason why you're tracking meals. If you're tracking it purely because it's "good" or "useful" or whatever – nah. It's only useful if you make it useful. ... and if it's useless, no matter how hard you try to trick your brain, it will find ways to avoid doing the tedious task. So, you gotta figure out what exactly you're gonna get from that. Just writing down might not be enough — gotta believe that what you're doing, works. Once you've dealt with that, here's the cornerstone of sustainability: **Logging requires discipline**. Discipline heavily depends on you having enough energy and dopamine to make the "right" decision. So don't expect a perfect log — you're not gonna log a lot of meals, and that's probably fine. Just get back to it as soon as possible. On top of that, know that you need to find a log with the optimal amount of complexity. What's optimal is up to you, of course. There's a lot of food logs on the market that would require you to enter a detailed breakdown what you ate during every single meal. That is rather cumbersome and is not generally sustainable over the long run. So prefer tools that ask the right amount of questions. You might also wanna look for aggregate your meals from different source. Say, you're out in the city, got stuff to do. You go into a cafe, grab a snack, but you've still got to coordinate people, talk to them, etc. Would you remember to open an app and record a meal in that case? I wouldn't. A chatbot, though... It's easier to remember to log a meal if you can do it through the same messenger app. BUT there are only a few food logs that allow recording meals through multiple sources. If that doesn't look like something you need — feel free to skip, because that's rather difficult to find

If I want a snack sometimes it becomes a little tougher but I will stick with lower carb options like almonds, popcorn, pork rinds, something I've really liked recently were siete grain free chips. For snacks, it becomes a slippery slope as it's pretty easy to sit there with the bag and munch so I keep it away from me so that I will have to move in order to get a handful and generally that's about what I can have. The problem I had with meal tracking was after doing it for almost a year I got absolutely burned out from it and it drove me nuts but in the process it has taught me how to read labels, understand calories, better understanding of ingredients and just educated me on food. It's a process everyone should go through just to better themselves but for the long term it was easier on myself to understand what I was eating. Also it's not going to be perfect, you're going to have bad days and eat wrong and that's ok. Do a little more exercise that day and stay on track, don't let it get out of control because you had a minor setback. It's fine and you'll just move on and keep working at it.

As my knowledge grew [my need to test so much decreased](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-often-should-we-test.html). But I never stopped completely because I never forgot about the dreaded 'opathy sisters: retin, neur and nephr. I decided I wanted to keep my eyes, limbs and kidneys.
