Hi r/type2diabetes ! Firstly, thanks for sharing your stories. I’m very new to this world and am learning a lot. I just wanted to see if anyone has any advice/thoughts. Context - I’m 35, train 5 times a week (mixture of functional fitness/running) don’t really have any weight to lose (5,10 and 75kg) have eaten well, but allowed myself to snack because I train hard. I am also a part time baker… so I know my carb intake can reduce. Eating context - pre this finding I would have porridge for breakfast, poached eggs on toast for lunch and some kind of healthy dinner maybe with a carb. Since finding I’m pre diabetic - measure 47 on the test. (48 being actual type 2)- I have: - dropped any refined carbs - completely cut out snacking - fast from 8-12/1pm - eat a balance of greens, proteins and good fats (avos etc). - occasionally have whole wheat noodles in small quantities for dinner. Supplements taken daily: - berberine - fibre pre meal - magnesium - yerme mate tea. I am 2 weeks into my monitoring. And an average daily read looks like the images attached. Be great to get some thoughts/feedback etc How long should it be before you should see some changes? Thanks everyone! Hoping sharing this journey will help as I learn. As all i have been medically told is ‘exercise and eat well’ Thanks ✌️

Look at your peaks, especially post-meal peaks. Yours look pretty good but could do with some improvement. You have made a good start, this might help you fine-tune the menu using your Libre: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

You may want to wait for the official 48 to let it sink in or you can just aknowleldge it now and get on with your life.. It'll safe you some time and bad health. I am not familiar with a fast from 8-12/1pm. If you have breakfast before 8 then it isn't a fast. It's just a gap between breakfast and lunch. Also porridge is a massive no no no.. Hopefully you have dropped it. Noodles? You might as well just have pizza, you ll spike less and feel satiated for longer. With the way you eat I don't think you'll see major changes.. That is if I understand correctly that you have porridge in the morning. There's no meet, fish, cheese in your diet?

There are A1C at-home test kits available online and in stores. They average about $20/test online. I take my A1C at the beginning of each month. My first reading was 6.9, and a month later it was 6.3. I had been fairly diligent during that month, I had ice-cream twice, and I had alcohol on 2 occastion. Once you cross the line, you will always be diabetic. You can drive it into remission, but you can't "cure it", so drop your numbers now.
