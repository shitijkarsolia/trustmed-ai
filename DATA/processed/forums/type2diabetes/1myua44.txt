===============================================================================

Hello. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Some early struggles include wicked cramps in my feet, sleepless nights, and struggling with what I can and cannot eat. The worst symptom of all is the bi-daily diarrhea(it’s super foul and the coloring is dark). So far my doctor has me on metformin (1000 mg 2x daily) glipizide and rosuvastatin. Any advice or words of encouragement are welcomed

Have always been overweight, a fast foodie, and soda drinker. My story and things I've done that may help or give encouragement. When I got diagnosed, my A1C was 10.8. My doctor initially had me on 1000mg extended release Metformin twice per day, morning Jardiance, morning Atorvastatin, and evening Lisinopril. She also tried to get Ozempic, but insurance denied a it and also said I had to wait 30 days before having an approved GLP1 (2.5 Mounjaro). She didn't do a good job explaining a good diet, and I've always been a bit food restrictive and extremely carb heavy. I also overreacted a bit. Came home and threw away probably $200 worth of food, snacks, drinks, etc. Was barely eating and it was also state testing time so stressed. I literally had some days where I ate a grand total of 8 carbs and 300ish calories. Between a "carb detox" and the meds, my system was wrecked. I went into a deep dive on tiktok and YouTube. Knew I needed to lose weight and cut carbs and almost all sugars. So, I started on carnivore and then shifted to a "dirty keto" method. Currently exploring different things that seem or taste normal instead of some of the questionable tasting alternatives. Some things that I've liked are Oikos Triple Zero Greek yogurt, of course string cheese, zero sugar jello/pudding, significantly cutting any condiments or swapping to G Hughes sauces, moving to higher protein meats/meals, swapping to Zero Sugar soda (Dr. Pepper Zero is my favorite), and swapping regular sandwich bread to Sara Lee Delightful (I tried Nature's Own keto bread and it just tasted off). I've also just worked on portion control. Snack bag of potato chips instead of just eating from a family sized bag. I also eat a metric ton of meats. Specifically ground beef at present. 93/7 is my usual now. I can do 4 patties at a time with a little bit of sauce, toppings, and Sara Lee delightful with a very negligible bump on my CGM. I've also made some swaps or mods on fast food, because when I'm running from school to school, sometimes I have to do easy. Popeyes Blackened Tenders taste great, are low carb and calorie, and high in protein. Pair with a zero carb tortilla or just by themselves with a diet soda and I'm a happy camper. I've started bringing a loaf of Sara Lee delightful bread to my office and using it instead of a hamburger bun on say a burger from Burger King. No condiments on it. Still some carbs, but a better swap and I can still enjoy it. When I'm out with friends or there's an office party (I know how Christmas is at schools), I'll let myself have very small portions of something that feels normal. A small handful of fries AFTER I've had my protein. A tiny scoop of mac and cheese. Just a couple of chips with a little dip. A very small piece of cake. If I try to continue to just deny myself I know I will absolutely fail. That all said, these changes led to this. 3 months later, and I was down to 5.2 A1C and down 35lbs. I then increased my 2.5 Mounjaro to 5. Caused my blood glucose to go low consistently, so my Doc said I could come off Metformin. Kept everything else. 2 months since then and I'm down another 20lbs with an average glucose reading in the upper 70s/low 80s range. I've seen my readings go up to 120-140 range after eating and then be back to normal inside 2 hours. It takes work, and a mindset change, but life is much better now. Yes, I have to be cognizant of what I eat. But with time, I've come to see it as a chance to get healthier for the rest of my years. Feel free to DM if I can ever recommend or help. I get the unique challenges being a teacher.

My problem I'm finding is my appetite wasn't brilliant before &amp; is now even less I literally have to force myself to eat can't do breakfast that just won't stay in me ..since being put on Metformin.. I was losing weight before I went on this but now the weight is coming off nicely I was 266lbs I've lost 66lbs since March I feel better for it.. I do need to go &amp; check in with my GP &amp; Diabetes Nurse I'm hoping my levels have dropped I also want them to discuss my levels I was originally 7.7 then I was tested 3wks later it was down to 6.6 the Nurse said they want my level down to 4.8 I've no clue what all this is about nobody explained wasn't even told what I should &amp; shouldn't be eating I'm now going on a course in a few wks time to learn about Type 2 Diabetes

Also if able try to walk 5000 steps or more per day.
