===============================================================================

My doctor says I'm not diabetic...yet. My A1c floats around 6.0-6.3. I've had a recent fasting test that was in the diabetic range but the one following was just pre-diabetic. The doc's only advice was to keep up what I'm doing, which is getting more exercise, eating less sugar and carbs, and losing weight. But I think it would be vastly easier to construct a good diet for myself if I was able to test my blood sugar after eating specific meals. I never felt I ate too many carbs and sugar, so I'm not really sure what's causing my spikes and I'd like to find out. Do you think this is a good idea? If so, what test kits would be good to try? I'm a bit needlephobic. Also, can you get the finger prick test kits without a prescription? Thanks!

That is exactly what you should be doing. &gt;what test kits would be good to try? Any kit which has inexpensive test strips in your locality; that can vary according to country and state. They are all good enough for the task. When you get it this will help: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) &gt; I'm a bit needlephobic.

If my doc told me to test while I was pre I don’t think I’d have wandered into a higher A1C (of course you never know) and I probably would have dropped my numbers. I use Walmart’s ReliOn Platinum. Strips are reasonably priced too.

It has a free app that you can download on your phone which you can then download you finger prick test results to via Bluetooth. The app had quite a bit of functionality, you can track meals, meds, a1c, make notes etc. Also, you can generally get a free meter with the purchase of 100 strips. I believe there is a coupon on the Contour website for this.

One app collects all my data and it knows the difference between CGM values and fingersticks. It makes data collection, management and reporting super simple. You don't need a prescription anymore as the test machine is $26 and the test strips are about 3 cents/day.

If you have health insurance I would recommend pushing your doctor to give you a prescription for a finger prick test kit/glucose monitor to test what foods affect your blood sugar. It is much cheaper getting it through insurance. But you can buy glucose monitors over the counter or even online on Amazon. I was also scared of pricking my finger, but it isn't so bad. It feels like an ant bite to me haha. Personally, along with my glucose monitor, I have been using the Dexcom Stelo glucose biosensor (its a thing you stick to your arm for 2 weeks to continuously monitor your blood sugar). It might not always be accurate but it helps me to realize what foods spike me. I use my glucose monitor to prick and see once in a while if my Stelo is accurate or not. But just a warning, Stelo can be quite pricey. A month of monitoring (2 biosensors that last 2 weeks each) is around $100. If you buy a subscription (1 or 3 months) it is slightly cheaper. If you have a FSA with your employer, you can use it to pay for it. Overall, Stelo made me very aware of what spikes me like fruits or potatoes and that eating blueberries with greek yogurt spikes me less. It gives me a sense of control and less anxiety. Hopefully this helps you out. I'm pretty new in my journey too and started taking control of my health this year.

I also hated needles but after literally two days of using it, I no longer care. Lance the side of your finger instead of the top and you’ll barely feel it. You could try getting a CGM but honestly I think that would be overkill in your specific situation.
