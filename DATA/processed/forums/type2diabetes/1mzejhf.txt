===============================================================================

So I have been monitored by my bg pretty often this last week trying to determine what foods may cause a spike in bg. This evening, after very steady readings, I decided to eat some pizza. These were the first real wad of carbs I have had in 3 months. I took my bg an hour after eating and it was 96. Then I took it 2 hours and it was 146. I did my evening jog for 30 mins, and an hour after it was 146 it was 72. I am not on any meds. Im a 53 year old male. I’m not even convinced I have diabetes yet but I digress. Is that rapid spike and drop normal? Do I need to check the meter? I’ve never had my bg swing that fast in two directions in that short a time period. Thanks!

Pizza brought it up took 2 hours to fully digest and get into the bloodstream then the jog helped massively to bring it down. Wish I could get my lazy self to do a jog after eating. But I digress.

That is slightly high for 2 hours after eating (a lot of my literature says for normal people it should be below 140) but I wouldn't be running to the doctor in the morning. Have two slices and an apple next time. Lol.
