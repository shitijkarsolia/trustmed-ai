===============================================================================

Diagnosed with and living with type 2 diabetes, no insulin and I am on 500mg of metformin twice a day. I need suggestions recs for a new machine. . What is an accurate finger stick that doesn’t break the bank? I'm in Canada and I need to buy over the counter as my insurance wont cover than 200 sticks a year.

When you get your meter this should help you use it systematically: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

Read medical reports and independent testing documents is how I discovered them. Confirmed by testing when did blood draw for glucose test and compared results. Was within 1% of lab results. Accuracy is everything (not cost) because I use insulin and depend on this device for the correct dosage. Also has a Bluetooth model to log results. I get readers and strips from Amazon or whoever is cheaper.
