===============================================================================

So I lost about 30 pounds so far and lowered my a1c from 9.2 to 6.1 in 2 months. I changed my diet drastically and I'm doing well..... except my glucose is running lowish all the time and it's been making me sick/sweaty. I had serving size of cottage cheese as a snack, then 30 minutes later had half a quest protein pizza. About an hour later my glucose is only 103 and going lower. Im sweating and dizzy as I write this. Yesterday I got lowered from 1000mg to 500mg of metformin because of it. My question is, how long will it take for my body to adjust to the lower dosage? I'm tired of feeling so weak and sick!!

What were the numbers which caused your doctor to say that?

When you get to near 100 and your body hasn’t had time to adjust to it you can easily experience the symptoms you are having. All of this is good news despite the feeling. Mine lasted about 2 weeks until I felt normal again. Keep doing what you are doing.
3. u/Stellar_Crafter [score=3, created=2025-08-26T14:32:37]: 103 is not actually a low number. Under 70 is low. I experience hypoglycemic symptoms before then, but it is most likely due to the fact my body is still adjusting to having a lower overall glucose level. I had been pre diabetic for over a decade, so my body was used to the higher sugar levels. If you are still concerned, have an open and honest discussion with your doctor.
