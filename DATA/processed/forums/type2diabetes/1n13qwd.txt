===============================================================================

I posted on here back in May after I was newly diagnosed with an A1C of 10 and fasting blood sugar of 264. The grief and shame I felt was so overwhelming I really thought I was not going to make it. That first week was torture in my own mind. It seems so dramatic now but I truly believed I ruined my body. I am only 28 and just felt my life was over. My first thought when I saw those labs were “I’m eating keto and will never touch a carb again”. I pouted and starved myself for a few days and then snapped back to reality. I got some good advice here and I made a plan with my doctor. He started me on Metformin 500mg ER daily and Monjauro. I started tracking macros on the Nourish app and met with a nutritionist on there. I also was luckily in therapy already for my mental health because it took a huge toll. I have really taught myself how to eat mindfully but still have a long way to go. I started exercising although could work harder on this (I enjoy being a couch potato). Today I got my labs back for my 3 month check and was so anxious to see them. But I am feeling so hopeful and motivated now. I was able to bring my A1C to a 6, fasting blood sugar to 116 and am down 25 pounds. My point in making this post is to thank everyone that spends time on here helping people who are new to diabetes. I also want to let anyone who is scared and sad about your diagnosis to know that this is not your fault. But the way you handle it and take control of your life after is. If I can do this, anyone can.

That's not an easy thing to achieve and most people don't manage to do so much so quickly. It's something to be proud of. On the exercise thing I too have never been too keen on it. What helped me was habit, and learning via experiments with CGMs that I have more freedom with what I can eat if I go for a walk afterwards. Walking doesn't feel like so much hard work to me compared to something like the gym. Less monotonous. I found that once I got into the habit of going for a walk around 30 minutes after the meal with the most carbs in a day, which helps both with blood glucose management and with overall health, it eventually got to the point where I feel an urge to do it at least once a day. It became a habit, a time to clear my head, and I miss it if I don't get my walk in, so long as the weather allows it. It seems that the more regularly you do it the better it feels. You actually start to miss it when you can't get your walk in. Just a thought - that's just what helped me get off the couch. Best of luck!
