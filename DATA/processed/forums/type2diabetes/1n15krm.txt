Got hit with the type two label half a year ago, and besides exercising, my doctor told me to cut carbs and sugars. Also recommended to fast. What do you guys do to keep your levels balanced?

Usually leftovers . Which was my dinner the night before we usually is some type of pasta or , chicken dish with veggies (always veggies) and cauliflower rice. But sometimes I'll do beef, or fish. But my type of work I burn a lot of calories and if my sugars spike all the walking brings it down. But as long as you exercise I think in my opinion. You can eat whatever. Just don't eat junk food. But once in a while it's nice 😎

Starts at around 98 in the morning and gradually decreases to about 75-80 before dinner. My lunch is almost always raw veggies and homemade sugar free ranch. Dinner is usually steak, chicken, or fish, with a steamed or baked vegetable side.
3. u/alan_s [score=2, created=2025-08-27T15:41:37]: Regarding schedules I tend to eat my three main meals roughly six hours apart with small (&lt;15gm carb) snacks at the three-hour points, but that is fairly flexible. I don't fast. I am not against it but back when I decided how to manage this beast over 20 years ago I realised I had to find a way of eating I could happily maintain for the rest of my life and fasting would not have achieved that. Instead this is what I did: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html)

I "buy" them for $0.00. In the comments, I wrote up a menu showing what I eat during a typical month. https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jj61j6/cookbook_hack/
5. u/JEngErik [score=6, created=2025-08-27T03:52:11]: Lots of vegetables and locally sourced meat. Almost always fast through to lunch and once or twice a month, fast for 32-44 hours. I make a lot of fermented and dehydrated snacks and dishes as well like saurkraut, kimchi, jerky, pickles, etc
6. u/jon20001 [score=3, created=2025-08-27T03:20:39]: Low sugar, low carb, high protein: Breakfast: sous vide egg bite and espresso Lunch: Sashimi platter, Mediterranean bowl (on greens), or salad with chicken or fish Snacks: Nuts, cheese, jerky or meat sticks, diet soda, occasional piece of fruit Dinner: Protein, green veggie, salad. Splurge with brown rice/quinoa blend or roasted potato Dessert: Half a Barebells protein bar When off schedule: Try to maintain what I can, enjoy an occasional treat (bite of dessert, pastry,, etc.)
