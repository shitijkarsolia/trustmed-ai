===============================================================================

I, stupidly, decided years ago to take diabetes lightly. I ignored it, didn't follow anything my doctor said. Today I'm writing this and I'm thinking about any reason why I didn't take it seriously. I can't find a reason why I didn't. At the beginning of 2024 I noticed changes in my vision. I had a gray area show up in my right eyes vision. My left eye the vision started to suffer as well. In February I went to get my eyes checked by a a regular eye doctor, and they said I had to go see a specialist right away, like they wanted me to see them that same day. I went to see them, and the severity of the damage of my eyes was really bad, there was hemorrhaging, their scar tissue, blood vessels growing all over and pulling on my retinas. I had developed retinopathy years before and by the time I saw the doctors it had turned into full-blown tractional diabetic retinopathy. I had severe SVD on my retina as well. We started out with treatments to help get a foothold and try to control the blood vessel in scar tissue growth, and let me tell you those laser treatments are not fun. They suck and they hurt a lot. By the time July rolled around, both of my retinas had detached and My doctor told me that I am legally blind now and possibly going to go blind. Because of how the blood vessels in the eyes and on kidneys are The same, there's a very likely chance that my kidneys are suffering and could be damaged. That in and of itself is dangerous and quite scary. I'm sharing this because I hope that it can honestly scare some of you into actually caring.

2. u/Ischarde [score=3, created=2025-08-30T21:06:17]: About 4 yrs ago, I had an eye bleed in my right eye (type 2, not as controlled as 8 thought I was). Saw ER and was sent to an excellent opthalmologist. She promptly started me on shots in that eye. Three months later, the left eye had a bleed. More shots in the eye. I've probably got retinopathy in both. It's 4 yrs now on shots in the eyes every 12 wks. Eye doc says like for life, tho she says it's maintenance now. The shots suck, my routine for them, both done at same time, is numbing them at a pre-op level. I'm grateful for my opthalmologist's kindness I hope she doesn't quit ever.

8. u/Spring_Biggins [score=5, created=2025-08-27T22:19:08]: Wow, I just received the same news about a week ago. Bleeding behind my eyes, but it's not as severe yet. I have an appointment with a retina specialist coming up this month. Do you have any additional advice? I need all the advice I can get. I'm nervous about this is upcoming visit to the retina specialist. I've also been trying to take my diabetes more seriously and eat better. I appreciate this post. It's right on time for me.

10. u/Beneficial_Unit_9898 [score=6, created=2025-08-27T21:03:55]: Thank you for posting this. I was diagnosed a year ago and it’s been a continuous battle between intense shame over the diagnosis, self delusion and denial, and making good choices for self care. I finally went and got an eye exam last week (so far so good, at least I have a baseline). This subreddit has probably been the most educational and motivating influence I have found since my diagnosis. I wish you all the best in your health journey; your life is so valuable and worth every effort no matter your current circumstance.
11. u/dogma68 [score=6, created=2025-08-27T18:47:00]: Please PLEASE stay on top of it! My late husband didn’t take care of himself and ended up with retinopathy and hated the laser treatments, too. He got multiple infections, one so bad in his shoulder it required four surgeries just to clean it out. Then came the kidney failure and dialysis. He died while hooked up to the dialysis machine.
12. u/Professional-Buy579 [score=8, created=2025-08-27T16:41:15]: I was diagnosed at the age of 64 after a lifetime of bad habits. But I've been following my Endo's advice religiously and I have it mostly under control. My A1C is back down to 5.5 but I also wear a Dexcom G7 and by continuously monitoring my blood sugar I can tell that my body has the appropriate reaction to carbs (spike, fall) but my average Glucose is too high meaning I'm permanently impaired for the rest of my life. I can still enjoy my life but I have to stay vigilant every day.

14. u/Zeus783 [score=9, created=2025-08-27T13:38:27]: This is probably one of my worst nightmare 😐 I found out to be diabetic due to eye problems; I went to bed one night and woke up with a fully formed cataract in my right eye and within a month had zero vision in that eye. By the time I had that cataract removed my left one had gone too though I had some partial vision left. It was one of the worst moments for me so can only empathise with what you are going through though your problem is permanent whilst mine was temporary. Glad to see you're in good spirit and helping others spreading the word. 👍
15. u/Own-Push5775 [score=9, created=2025-08-27T13:16:05]: Very sorry to read your post. Perhaps it will help and force others to act. Diabetes is a slow, silent killer, even with good diet control and exercise. I almost followed the ignoring path, but for losing my special licenses made me change. Maybe you can repair and reverse the damage. I have read about successes. Fight and don't give up. I took control, led, and drove my care while depending on medical teams. After +50 years of treating mine, I found out insulin was the best solution to stop the damage because it is human and immediate-acting. Other medications helped, but were slower and less effective, and all of them have adverse side effects. BTW, I fired my endo when he advised I was wasting my time tightly controlling my levels because the 2008 ACCORN questioned the yield benefits. As we say in racing, make your own luck.
16. u/SmallTownLady2U [score=9, created=2025-08-27T11:54:04]: I have so many other conditions including cancer that I honestly have been so lofty with diabetes. Thank you for posting this. If there is a way to send it privately to me please do so. Thank you for scaring me : ) I never want to forget how serious this is .
