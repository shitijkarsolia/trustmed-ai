===============================================================================

Hi. I wanted to ask a few things Everything is new And unclear to me so far. I have been told by the NHS UK that I need to manage it myself for now with diet and exercise which is fair enough. Instead of guessing and wondering I thought maybe a blood sugar monitor would Help. Like the one you attach to you. Can anyone recommend one that would be helpful and accurate ? And is there any good diets or plans to follow as I feel I am going to be eating the same stuff over and over due to lack of ideas and knowledge. Thanks.

They also have a good discussion forum where you can find information that is specific to the UK and ask questions. This recent thread for example is one where someone asked for recommendations about meters and CGM models available in the UK: [https://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/monitors.119097/](https://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/monitors.119097/) You'll find that pretty much any question you might have in the beginning has been asked and answered on that forum. This thread for example is a gem - full of good information: [https://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/tips-i-have-for-fellow-type-2-newbies.116061/](https://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/tips-i-have-for-fellow-type-2-newbies.116061/) Best of luck!

I have avocado every day and 2 boiled or scrambled eggs. You will soon adapt to safe foods , and stay off grapes any processed foods all high in carbs and salt.

I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.

I was given an information booklet with meal ideas for breakfast lunch and dinner including snacks. This will s available on the NHS websites.I was told to focus on portion size, protein and wholemeal bread, rice and pasta. I thought it was impossible as I have other chronic health issues which makes exercise difficult. Nearly 1 year later my Ac1 is 3.9, I've lost 37lbs and changed my eating habits forever. I walk every day and built up how far I could go. For now my diabetes is well under control and after next month's blood is test I will have a yearly check up. It's overwhelming at the start and I hope you find your way of controlling this.
