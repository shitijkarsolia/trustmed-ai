===============================================================================

I’m 19 (male) and just got hit with something I honestly never expected this early. Both my parents are diabetic, and I guess genetics + lifestyle finally caught up to me. Here are my numbers from a recent lab report: Fasting glucose: 273 mg/dL (normal 70–110) HbA1c: 10.6% (average ~257 mg/dL over last 3 months) Urine sugar: ++ (so high that it’s spilling into urine) Lipids, kidney, liver, thyroid → all normal right now (thank god). Vitamin D → very low (12.6, should be &gt;30). I don’t have extreme symptoms like thirst, tingling, or vision loss. Mostly just fatigue. My doc told me to completely change my diet and lifestyle first, and we’ll see if meds are needed later. He didn’t order a C-peptide or antibody test, but since I was overweight (91kg at 182cm, now ~88kg), and both parents are Type 2, he thinks I’m most likely Type 2 diabetes rather than Type 1. Still, I’m young and this hit me hard. My parents are so sad and broken when they found out, and that broke me too. I know a lot of people my age eat like trash, but my genetics mean I can’t get away with it like they can. Right now I’m going militant with diet + workouts: Oats + whey + seeds + small fruit for breakfast Chicken + veggies + small measured brown rice for lunch Walnuts or paneer for snacks Protein + veggies for dinner (low/no carbs at night) Lifting weights 5x/week, walking after meals, some cardio/HIIT My goal is to drop fasting sugars from 273 into the 120–150 range in the next 40–60 days without meds. Questions for the community: 1. Anyone here diagnosed young (late teens/early 20s) — was it Type 1 or Type 2 in your case? 2. Did diet + exercise alone bring your numbers down, or did you need meds right away? 3. Any tips on keeping muscle mass while managing sugar (I don’t want to get skinny/weak)? This is all new to me, and honestly scary, but I don’t want to run from it. If I can get control now, maybe I can live strong for decades instead of letting this eat me alive. Appreciate any advice, stories, or tough truth you’ve got.

2. u/Professional-Push925 [score=1, created=2025-08-31T12:10:37]: I am adopted so no idea on family history… but I was 22 when initially diagnosed with type 2. Was given metformin and it made me sick as hell, so my pcp prescribed Ozempic. Was on it for like a year and a half or so. Then had a series of events that led to now, right after turning 25, I got accepted into grad school, my pcp was arrested for overprescribing opiates, and then started grad school. For the next two years I didn’t have time to find a new pcp since all doctors are closed Saturday and Sunday and school had me going from 5:30AM to 8 PM almost every weekday. After graduating this past May I knew it was a priority to get my health in check. I’d been feeling tired all the time too. Got a new PCP, who sent me to endocrinology immediately. My A1C was 11.4 when I started seeing them so she put me on insulin. Our talk plus what I already knew, I made dietary changes but not ones as strict as yours, and the changes I made are working so far. I am hoping to get on Ozempic or Mounjaro soon to lessen the amount of insulin I’ll need. But waiting to hear about that for now. A month into insulin and my A1C was back to a 9.0, so at least it’s helping. Until now dieting is something that never really worked for me. Some might blame it on my own willpower, but I am also severely adhd with anxiety/depression, and food was always a comfort for me to run to for anything going on in life. That’s changing a little now that I’m working on keeping my numbers in range but I still refuse to call it dieting because that makes it so much less motivating for me. So for now Ive just been calling it “better choices” lol. As for exercise, that’s also always been hard for me. I have extreme head/facial sweating anytime my body does more than a short or slow walk. This sweating makes it hard to breathe, see, and tolerate exercise due to feeling extremely uncomfortable. But I’ve found that swimming, yoga, and building my walking tolerance has been helpful so far. Hope this finds you in better spirits, diabetes SUCKS, but you seem to be on an even better track than me with your mindset!

I am Native American and diabetes runs DEEEEP in my family, I was doomed from the moment I was born. 2. Insulin and metformin is what they put me in right away because I went into the hospital with blood sugar up to 732. I was beyond not having to take medications. 💊 it took time to adjust my diet and the meds to kick in. I struggle for a very very long time. Until about 4 years ago they put me on. Ozempic. I lost 35 pounds, along with exercising I am now off all the insulin and metformin. 😎 I literally credit the Ozempic so much. 3. Excerise and protien 👏🏼 is my best advice on that. I know it scary as hell and being 10 years a diabetic I am still learning but it’s possible to better yourself. The thing that kept me going was that I promised myself that I would never ever let the Diabetes win ever. Now my A1C is a 5.2 and my fasting sugar is 92. You got this I promise

Food: Don’t eat Bread, Cereal, Potatoes, Rice,Pasta, check carbs on everything don’t eat any processed foods full of crap, eat Chicken, Fish, Lean Red Meat, Eggs, Vegetables, Red berries, there are plenty of alternatives you will be surprised. Excersize: I walk 5000 steps per day and 4 miles on excersize bike daily it works. At your age you should be able to do a lot more I’ve never felt fitter in my life so not all bad. Like I said earlier keep positive and you will be fine, also don’t expect changes quickly it takes a good 3 months to start making progress. Good luck HMU anytime if you have any further questions be glad to help.

Unfortunately I had to go straight onto insulin which brought my levels into range with the amount of exercise I was still doing. This year I got and injury that but me out of exercise and I noticed the difference on my level control so definitely keep up with that. Hopefully in your country the necessary meds can be funded and you can retain some normality with low maintenance medication

It is wise to be as certain as possible of your type. Request a c-peptide test anyway. Your age should be sufficient to justify the test. Losing weight was probably good for your health but if you are type 1 it will not help control your blood glucose levels. &gt;***Oats*** \+ whey + seeds + ***small fruit*** for breakfast &gt;Chicken + veggies + small measured ***brown rice*** for lunch &gt;Walnuts or paneer for snacks &gt;Protein + veggies for dinner (low/no carbs at night) Regardless of your type that can be improved. I know people will have told you those choices are healthy but for type 2 it is all about carbohydrates, not calories. For example I have highlighted the danger foods in your list. I presume you now have either a home blood glucose meter or a continuous glucose monitor. Use it to modify your menu for healthy blood glucose levels. I wrote this to help you do that: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html)
7. u/vba77 [score=1, created=2025-08-28T17:14:30]: I think I was mid 20s? Basically learned getting my weight down made a huge difference for me to a point I didn't need meds and my sugar was back to normal but I also had to watch what I ate. When I was diagnosed it was bad. Like the units in Canada we use 7+ is bad. I had 20 and didn't feel it. It was nuts. I let my weight creep up recently And sugars up again but not as crazy as before. My doctors pretty supportive and is up to date on meds and treatment so he's pretty supportive. Now that I'm older and I see others getting it it really seems to be obesity or low muscle mass for the skinnier people and they get it more as they get older and muscle mass starts dropping
8. u/Available-Ad-7555 [score=3, created=2025-08-28T15:51:18]: Keto is the way to go. Focus on organic Whole Foods. Prioritize protein, fiber, greens. Rice is ok, but oats are less ideal. It’s more diet and exercise than genetics. The more muscle you have the more easily your body can handle and process sugars and carbs. Weight lifting will do you wonders. Get stronger, gain muscle, go for long walks. Or do a couple short jogs every day. Push ups, body weight squats. Cut out all sodas and chips. Especially anything with high fructose corn syrup. Drink more water.
9. u/Sir_Toccoa [score=10, created=2025-08-28T14:52:31]: You may want to look into a lower carb diet. Rice and oats are going to continually spike your blood sugar and insulin.
10. u/BulkyBusiness384 [score=0, created=2025-08-28T14:11:29]: was diagnosed at 24 im 30 now my fasting was not that high but was 170 so im on metformin and glipizide metformin is the worst to be on it can make you feel sick make you have the runs well does me not sure about others but many had really bad side effects with metformin but that the top medication they will give you they will start you low then raise it if needed they will start like at 2 then 4 tops they are 500mg you can get the ER aka extended or 12 hour one im on ER i hope everything works out for you

12. u/aeseline [score=2, created=2025-08-28T12:02:41]: It’s not always what you do unfortunately. I’m 35 (definitely older than you, ofc), underweight, eat well and run but am bordering on type 2. Don’t let the type 2 haters get you down. There is a lot you can do to help yourself. A couple tips I hope will help you achieve your goals - 1. oats for a lot of T2s will make your glucose crazy. If it’s a deal breaker consider steel cut only, but I love oats and just have to avoid them at the moment because it’s not worth it. 2. Watch the cholesterol. Consider getting yours checked. Low carb can sometimes mean bad cholesterol if your saturated/animal fats go up a lot. Lean meats and nuts. Wishing you the best. Welcome, though wish we weren’t here.
13. u/usafmd [score=4, created=2025-08-28T10:27:06]: You aren’t screwed unless you’re screwing yourself going forward. Remember that 100 years ago type 2 diabetes was much less common than type 1. Diabetes running in your family is more likely lifestyle than it is genetics.
14. u/darowlee [score=3, created=2025-08-28T09:57:34]: Your life isn't over. I was diagnosed at almost 30 and my A1C was like 15.8 lol. Yeah you'll need to make some changes. Reduce your overall carb consumption and add some exercise in. You'd be amazed how big of a difference just small tweaks can make too. Don't go too big too fast or you won't maintain it. It's a lifestyle change, not a diet.
15. u/prettypotterprincess [score=5, created=2025-08-28T09:22:51]: Welcome to the club. Some personal experience to answer your questions. Be aware that these are my experiences, and diabetes can react very differently for every person. 1. I was diagnosed about 6 months ago at 27. My fasting sugar was 252 and my A1c was 10.3. Like you everyone in my immediate family is diabetic, and my diagnosis was Type 2 diabetes. 2. I just had my follow up and my fasting sugar was 108 and my A1c was 5.9. I am on 1000 mg of metformin a day that my doctor has said may not be necessary anymore, but I have continued to take it for other health reasons. Other than the metformin, I went very hard on diet and lifestyle changes for about the first month. I cut out all refined carbs, sugars, and artificial sweeteners to give my body a reset. I have a continuous glucose monitor, and over the summer I have slowly started adding back into my diet while being mindful of how it’s impacting my blood sugar (do I get a spike and for how long). 3. This is gonna be the hard one. Eat the proper amount of protein ( I have to supplement because I don’t get enough through diet alone) and make sure you work strength training into your routine and you should be fine. If you can afford to do so, work with a nutritionist and/or trainer to help you figure out your plan. If you can’t, some apps may help you keep track. It’s so scary. I cried when I first got the bloodwork results and felt so defeated, but I have found that being young has helped my body adjust very well. Don’t go all or nothing, that will setup yourself for failure. If you have a bad meal or day or week, it’s okay. Just start again at the next meal. I’m big on “I’m living with diabetes” and not “I can’t have that because I have diabetes.” I eat cake at celebrations, and if I have a real craving for something like pasta or bread, I’ll eat a small portion of it with a big portion of protein. I eat protein first, then my vegetables, and then finish my meals with any carbs. I find that keeps me fuller and I’ll eat less carbs and helps my body digest the protein first which helps sometimes with the spike. Try and ask for a cgm. It helps tremendously. Other than that, you’ve got this!
16. u/ExternalScale8119 [score=7, created=2025-08-28T09:20:14]: Go lower on carbs. Your blood sugar reacts on oats and brown rice. Eat eggs, cabbage, cauliflower rice... Remember some olive oil and nuts. Every thing will be ok. My diagnose saved my body. I am not tired anymore. I walk and do exercises, eat healthy, no brainfog. Lost 45 kg. (Not english speaking)
