This is what I did: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html) Gaining control of my blood glucose levels was priority one. Once I achieved that I moved to stage 2: [What is a Balanced Diet For a Type 2 Diabetic?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/what-is-balanced-diet-for-type-2.html)

I make containers of ingredients and then fix myself a bowl at mealtime. Example meals are salmon, 1/2 cp quinoa, arugula with avocado oil and salt. Or ground beef, small sweet potato and green beans. Bfast is 2 scrambled eggs with avocado, apple slices and pnut butter. I shoot for about 2/3 cp protein, maybe 1/2 cp carb and as much green veg as I want. It is simple but works well. My fasting glucose has gone from 160 to 90 in just 3 months. I feel so much better too!

I went clean keto in the beginning while I was still taking medication. Now, with no medication of any kind, I eat a zero-carb high fat and exercise daily. I am finishing up a 72-hour fast and just got back from a 10-mile bike ride. My blood sugar is currently 58 and I am feeling amazing. Explore the journey and accept that you will evolve overtime.

I cut carbs to approximately 20g a day and eat a lot of grilled chicken, fish, lean deli meats and green vegetables with little starch such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, leeks etc. I don’t eat rice, potatoes or fruits (except the occasional very small portion of berries) and I eat small portions three times a day with no snacking, It is important to note that my BMI is 48.8 so I am also trying to lose weight to avoid organ damage. However, my A1C was 10 and now it is 5
