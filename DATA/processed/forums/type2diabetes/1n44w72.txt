===============================================================================

I am newly diagnosed and very frustrated. As soon as I got the results I started a low carb food plan in a calorie deficit. I’m eating 30g or less carbs per meal and most carbs are coming from fruits (blueberries, strawberries, apples), vegetables, and beans. The doctor started me on Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 5mg, and Mounjaro. I couldn’t tolerate the Metformin. So it was switched to Glipizide 10mg extended release 2x a day, 14 units of Lantus 1 time a day and Mounjaro. Since starting on the meds and eating low carb plan my blood sugar is consistently higher than it was in the fasting blood test, even after a longer fasting period. Fasting in lab work -240 Average since starting treatment - 276 over 2 week period I keep telling the doctor that this feels wrong. I was having no symptoms prior to diagnosis, now I’m constantly nauseated and my energy level has plummeted. I’m extra concerned because I get a long acting steroid injection in my back every 8-12 months due to a 2.5 centimeter herniated disc in my lower back. The pain is returning and I need another injection, but the doctor won’t do it till my levels are in the normal range. Is there something I’m doing wrong? Am I expecting too much or should I look for a new provider who won’t dismiss my concerns?

Also try eating your veggies before anything else, yes it’s a pain but it works. Then eat your protein and then the carb. I read the Glucose Goddess books, written for non-diabetics because it’s damaging for your body’s sugar to spike, diabetic or not. I tried all her advice and it has helped me tons. It’s also helps to walk for 10 minutes, 90 minutes after you have eaten. All the doctors I have been to, other than my DO, do not care about anything other than lining their pockets. I really wish you the best.

While you wait for those discussions and tests this might help: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html)
