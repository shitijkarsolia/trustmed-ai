Hey guys. I’ve been diabetic for a couple years My A1c is 6% currently, at diagnosis it was 10.7. I’ve recently started a new job in retail which means I’m averaging around 15,000-20,000 steps a day. I’ve noticed that my lips are tingling even though my sugars are usually around 5.2-5.8mmol on average (I think that’s 93-104mg/dl). I was wondering if anybody else has experienced this, I’m due to meet the diabetic nurse in a couple weeks so will bring this up. I haven’t experienced this before so I am a little worried.

I have tingling in my lips, random muscle spasms that are brief and numbness mainly different areas of my entire face. There is nothing you can really do about it other than getting things under control and hope the nerves regenerate. You can take pills but they just mask the pain and didn’t help me at all. I chose supplements and deal with it.

I’ve never experienced tingling of face or lips. I would definitely bring this up with your provider. Just wanted to give you another data point. Cheers
