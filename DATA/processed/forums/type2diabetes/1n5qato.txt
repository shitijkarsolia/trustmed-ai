===============================================================================

So on of the things that clued me into something being wrong with me was my feet. Over the last year I noticed increasingly that my feet hurt, tingled, numbness in toes, and burning. Some nights it was pretty miserable. Some shoes made my feet feel more numb. My sugar has been very controlled by diet and exercise the last 4 months, particularly this month as I have lost weight. I have noticed this month my feet feel mostly normal. Other than a slight stiffness around the toes they feel okay. I don’t have the tingles, numbness (except for a slight lack of sensation on one side of my right second toe) and they never burn anymore. They can be touched and it not make me jump out of my skin. My feet are also not as dry and flaky. The skin is smooth. I can wear less comfortable shoes without issue now. My question is, has anyone else experienced this and will it last as long as I keep my glucose tightly controlled? The doctor said it was permanent and we needed to keep it from getting worse. My bg is basically normal now. I rarely have a reading over 120 and it never lasts very long when it does. If I maintain this will I keep healing or are there limits? I would say it is 90% better.

It was so bad that it would keep me up at night and I went to the doctors and I got vitamin B 12 it did help a lot, but I still couldn’t handle the pain in my on my feet and I took myself off of it and my doctor was OK with it and we are trying other medications now, I would wake up crying in the middle of the night because of how much my feet would hurt I am usually 95% on target and with my CGM and A1c at a 6.2 and the pain was just unbearable, but like I said if vitamin B12 definitely helped a lot but at the end, it was the metformin, causing the deficiency.
