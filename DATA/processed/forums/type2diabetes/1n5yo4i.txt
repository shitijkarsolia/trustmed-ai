===============================================================================

The standard advice to eat the BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Apples, Toast) is everything I need to avoid while eating low carb/low sugar to maintain my health with type 2. Chicken broth, tea, water, and as I get better, boiled eggs are all I can come up with. According to my symptoms and the timing of them, it’s pretty clear something I ate last night was responsible.

You're right about the eggs, scrambled or boiled. I eat them on keto just because they can help with weight loss. They're also an ideal keto food. Keto reversed my type 2. I am keto now, but I've been sick since starting keto, and I usually crunch on celery with sea salt or sip on natural animal broth for the extra salt. I also find that cauliflower rice ( no carbs)and heated in chicken broth help. If you try it, you can also add sliced pieces of already made store bought rotisserie chicken. It really helps kill the virus. It really does the trick. No blood sugar spikes. On keto, the only fruit allowed are berries ( blue, black, strawberry, raspberries) due to extremely low sugar content. Again, there are no spikes. Warm lemon tea with no sugar substitutes works, too. Good luck, and I hope you get better soon.

It seems to me, as a non-medical professional, that recovering from food poisoning is more important than temporary spikes and blood sugar, but that’s really a doctor-level issue.
