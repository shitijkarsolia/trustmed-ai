Will being sick spike your hr and bg? I have been doing great. Amazing even. Complete turn around. For 3 weeks my bg has been well within normal range. I have maintained my very low carb diet. I am exercising increasingly. I get 25 to 30 steps a day. I run for 30 mins every other day. I’ve watch my resting heart rate decline into the 60’s over this month. My sugar has been steady as a rock and super controlled. Never a reading about 120 for weeks. Most of them have been below 100 throughout the day. I have been jazzed and encouraged. Everything was normal Friday. 3 day weekend. I felt a little lazy and tired Saturday, so I took it easy for the day. For the first day in months I got less than a 100 steps. All weekend and Monday, my blood sugar has been consistently 30 points higher than it has been eaten by the exact same foods and the same amount of exercise on Sun and Mon. My heart rate is 10 beat higher resting, walking, and during exercise as it was last week. I have had a very slight sniffle. But I am a t a her and illness is running rampant at school. Does sickness or Covid cause this? It’s super frustrating because I know I’m not eating anything I should not.

Pretty much anything that causes mental and/or physical stress can (and in my case, will) cause a blood sugar spike. Some examples I've experienced include: * getting overheated * dehydration * overexertion * allergies * respiratory illness * injuries causing swelling/inflammation * insufficient sleep * stress * anxiety

Also, if you are taking any meds for the illness, that can cause problems too. I know I'm not feeling great, and my sugar was high this morning. I'm going to watch and see.
3. u/ephcee [score=3, created=2025-09-02T08:16:33]: Yes. Anything that raises cortisol and increases inflammation (mental or physical stress), can increase your heart rate and bg. That’s why it’s important to consider the whole picture, and not just diet (not saying that’s what you’re doing, but that’s an assumption people make).
