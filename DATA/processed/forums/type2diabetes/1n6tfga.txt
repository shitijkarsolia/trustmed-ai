===============================================================================

From my understanding, I cannot really lose visceral fat and build muscle at the same time. But I do want to maintain the muscle I have. As type 2, is there a way to minimize muscle loss as I get rid of this visceral fat that is choking my organs? I’m 53 male, no meds. Specifically, how should I lift weights? Heavy or light? Lots of reps? And is my keto ish diet good for this? My ultimate goal is to get rid of my middle for reduced insulin resistance. Thanks!

My calf raises against a wall for steadiness are 50-100 each twice a day. I also lift 12 pd weights four days a week for 30 minutes. The most important muscles to work on for max weight loss are the thigh, calves, and glutes. If you can go keto, I always recommend it. Weight loss, lean muscle mass while strengthening and building muscle 💪 You don't need to bulk up.

Any training that you can maintain is the right approach. Long-term compliance to both diet and exercise is so much more important than either optimization or avoiding any muscle loss. Just start exercising and get in control. What matters more; maintaining muscle mass and letting your disease progress unchecked, or losing weight and giving yourself years of better health to reevaluate how important your physique is? Stop researching and start doing. Eat less/better and excercise. Eventually, eat healthier for 95% of meals and try training instead of just exercise. Just start now-- literally go for a walk and don't eat a second helping. Do some bodyweight squats. Start
