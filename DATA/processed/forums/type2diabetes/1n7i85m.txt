===============================================================================

So I struggled with medication side effects in regards to stomach issues and taking this with my meal 1-2 times a day helped a lot. I like to drink protein meal substitute drinks or bars sometimes and it never sits right with me but fiber powder works wonders for me, it keeps me full and also helps my stomach activity super healthy. I recommend this for anyone who’s struggling with stomach issues especially from metformin. I wish I had figured this out earlier!!! It also helps if you have a light/healthy meal you’ll stay fuller longer and also not get a stomach ache/diarrhea.

5. u/Specialist_Income_31 [score=1, created=2025-09-03T12:50:00]: The psyllium husk powder from Trader Joe’s is really good too. I cannot get past the taste though. Any ideas how to get this stuff down?
6. u/pastryfiend [score=1, created=2025-09-03T11:27:44]: I take this daily too. It's helped a lot, making me very regular and I'm using much less toilet paper to clean up. I started taking it when I was having issues with mourjaro. I have to go to Costco today to buy more of this exact product. I still try to get enough veg every day but this supplements well.
