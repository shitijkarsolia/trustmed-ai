===============================================================================

Hi everyone! I'm new to all this mess and I feel like I can't get a grip on any of it. I am FRUSTRATED. A little background information- I had a pituitary macroadenoma removal in 2021 leaving my pituitary completely useless and me on steroid replacement for the rest of my life. This has led me to steroid induced type 2 diabetes. On that note, I have an endocrinologist that I see regularly every 3 months for monitoring of all my, what seems like, million of ailments. She is WONDERFUL, except when it comes to this. I'm having a horrible time managing my numbers down. I am currently on 2 Kwik pens- tresiba 10u for long acting and novolog 6u before meals for fast acting and a sliding scale as follows for corrective action if I can't get my numbers down after meals: 151 -200 1u 201 -250 2u 251 - 300 3u 301 -350 4u 351 -400 5u Over 400 6u I've been doing this sliding scale and I feel like it does NOTHING. When I wake up my fasting glucose will be around 130-150. I'll do the corrective 1u, it does nothing. So I'll go ahead and eat, I don't eat breakfast so I do lunch and try really hard to stick to things like rotisserie chicken with green beans or cottage cheese, etc. and I'm still hitting numbers over 200 after meals. So I'll do the corrective action on the sliding scale after I get dinged by my dexcom and 2 hours later, I'm still in the 200s. Do it again. Same thing. It will be like this ALL. DAY. LONG.i feel like I'm just constantly chasing my tail. Then it's time for dinner and my numbers will finally be around 120s and it's the same game over again. I don't know what to do. Do I just play around with my units until I find what's right for me despite what my endocrinologist is suggesting? I just feel like I'm not being heard. She keeps saying "you need to make sure you're not having lows" but that's not my problem. I'm feeling like garbage because I'm running high. I'm never the "normal" 70-100 like you're supposed to be. What am I doing wrong?

1. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=1, created=2025-09-04T00:20:15]: You’re not doing anything wrong, the problem is that using only a sliding scale often means you’re always “chasing” high sugars instead of preventing them. That’s why it feels like nothing is working. Usually, blood sugars are better controlled when: * Your **basal insulin (Tresiba)** is set at the right dose to keep your fasting numbers steady. If you’re waking up in the 130–150s, it might need a small adjustment. * Your **mealtime insulin (Novolog)** is matched to the carbs you eat, instead of always taking the same 6 units. This is called carb counting, and it usually works much better. * The **sliding scale** can still be used, but it works best as a backup, not the main way you dose. The best step is to take your Dexcom readings and food logs to your endocrinologist so they can help adjust your doses. Once your insulin matches your meals better, you should spend less time running high all day.
2. u/alan_s [score=1, created=2025-09-03T15:54:51]: I am not competent to comment on your meds and ratios, that is something to discuss urgently and in detail with your wonderful endo. However, I am wondering about your way of eating in terms of both timing and content. Missing breakfast suits some people but for others like myself it can lead to dawn phenomenon; read more about that here: [I Ate Nothing! Why Are My BGs high?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2009/02/i-ate-nothing-why-are-my-bgs-high.html) For that reason I have a small low-carb breakfast; usually one egg, a mushroom and half a small pork sausage. What dietary advice have you been given in terms of carbs, protein and fats per meal or per day? Use your meter or CGM to assess whether changes might help: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)
