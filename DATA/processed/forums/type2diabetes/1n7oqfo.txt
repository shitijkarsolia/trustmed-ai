===============================================================================

So ekg, chest xray and most of my blood tests were ok, except my wbc was slightly elevated. I also have no blood clots (thank god) the hard time breathing might have been an allergic reaction to a medication I took so I just might not be able to take anymore which I can live with. However.....the swelling in my ankle is kind of a mystery. It's getting worse by the hour. Red. Hot. Huge. Painful. I was prescribed antibiotics and I have to take it 4 times daily in case this is a skin infection (cellulitis). If not better in 3 days, I am to return to the ER because this could likely be a diabetes complication. Tbh with how it's progressing I'm scared I'll be back sooner than the 3 days. It's so frustrating because even my labs today showed my glucose improvement. My a1c went from 9.2 to 6.1 in 2 months. Im down 30 pounds. My blood pressure is great! I am finally eating decent. Everything else is getting better and yet... I'm just worse. Can I just say it? Fuck Diabetes.

You would likely be in a worse pot of trouble if you hadn’t been as diligent about that, which does not lessen the stress of your current struggle. However, it just goes to show that you’re gonna face this thing head on no matter what it throws at you. I wish you all of the luck on the battlefield, dude. You got this.
