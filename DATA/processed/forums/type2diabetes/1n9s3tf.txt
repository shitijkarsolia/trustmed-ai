I was flying every week for work and was so sick that I had to go back to the hotel to take naps in between meetings. I'm lucky I didn't die in some hotel room. One weekend at home my entire body started cramping up. I had to try to sleep in my La-Z-Boy chair at night. I finally saw a doctor and my BG was 425 and A1c was 13.4.

In retrospect, there are definitely symptoms when you’re sky high like I was. It explained a ton, I was constantly thirsty (I mean parched, waking up with cottonmouth), frequent peeing, itchy as all heck everywhere, fungal infections all over, severe patches of nigricans all over, disgusting toenails, horrible sleep and just generally constantly tired. Obvious ones are urinal tract infections and commonly infected pimples and bloods. They’re all common to diabetics. But it all happened gradually so it just became normalised and I’d never really put two and two together. I probably subconsciously knew to because I’d constantly duck my yearly checkup and bloods, get scripts from relatives for medication instead of going to the doc, etc. to avoid getting the verdict. Seeing the specialists at the hospital, the endocrinologist, the dietitian and the diabetic nurse was just a revelation. Really specific plans and facts based on me and my lifestyle and culture.

I kinda know when I've over done it on food by what I eat, but also cotton mouth. At it's worst I've had slight tingling in my fingers and toes, and I've had a couple of hypers, both after too much alcohol the previous night. Given your situation, I would suggest you read up on the disease and learn about all the horrible shit it does to you. Understand it, decide how you're going to tackle it and apply yourself. When I was diagnosed, I set myself two simple aims based on what I had read about controlling T2. Manage my carbs day to day to control my current blood sugar and lose weight/body fat over time to give my pancreas a chance to recover. I've lost 10kg and it seems to have been enough to allow my pancreas to produce enough insulin to mean I can have a more normal diet, albeit weary of carbs and avoiding straight sugar. I know I haven't won, I'll always need to keep things in check, but the strategy worked to give me more freedom of choice.
