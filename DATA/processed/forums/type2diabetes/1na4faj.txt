===============================================================================

Good morning everyone. I have had type 2 diabetes for a few years now. I am a delivery driver so I stay active I just don't know why but my numbers are always a little high. I do all the things I should. I occasionally have some sugar like maybe half and half sweet tea something like that but I try to be good most of the time. So in the last two weeks I feel like I have developed a thyroid problem because I have been losing my hair, my skin is really changing, I have lost about 20 lb and I have three loose teeth. So I went to the endocrinologist yesterday. They did not run any tests but they did a full analysis of me and said I think you may be type one and a half and insulin resistant so in the meantime until we can get all these tests ran on you we want you to try this Afrezza inhaler because I have noted in my chart that I am scared of needles. I cannot inject myself nor prick my finger. Just wondering if anyone has tried this, are there any side effects, and does it work or should I just bite the bullet and get someone to help me and start using a pump until I get all this figured out? I daily take Jardiance Metformin and Atorvistatin...
