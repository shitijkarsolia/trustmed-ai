===============================================================================

I know there is a whole debate around reversal and remission with T2. I understand I will always have it even if my numbers are normal, but I would like to hear from those who take no meds, but have “normal” bg and a1c. What I am really interested in is the form this “normal” takes. I put it in quotes because I want to know if it is a truly normal insulin and bg response, the same as someone without t2 would have. Or is it just so managed that you have learned to dull the spikes? I have experienced normal bg since I have been dieting and exercise (for over a month) with the exception of 3 days when I was sick. It was these three days where I learned if I don’t keep managing it my bg won’t be normal. Even my daily numbers are too high in the morning for having fasted 10 hours. But the numbers are in normal range. I guess what I am asking is does normal bg and a1c with controlled t2 look the same as for someone who doesn’t have it? I’m still totally new to this so bear with me if I have said something dense and thanks.

2. u/FatGuy_InALittleCoat [score=10, created=2025-09-07T09:04:57]: I was diagnosed at an A1C of 10 shortly after COVID in 2023. Got it checked yesterday and I’m at 5.6. The biggest step I took was making conscious decisions. For example, if I wanted a cheeseburger with the bun, get broccoli instead of fries. If I’d rather have the fries, get the burger with no bun. In changing my thought process to viewing things as a trade (have this instead of that but not both) I started re-wiring my diet and the way I viewed food. I have been on Synjardy 1,000MG twice a day. Now I’m on 5MG of Mounjaro (7.5 made me sick so I went back down to 5), 1,000MG of Synjardy once a day, and I’m down almost 70 pounds in 2 years.
3. u/Little-pug [score=2, created=2025-09-07T07:56:45]: I had reversed my diabetes and kept my A1C low for 5 years with diet and exercise no meds. Intense Stress happened and my A1C crept up to prediabetes levels slowly and then back to full blown diabetes despite still eating and exercising similarly. I wasn’t able to stay off meds and am now on mounjaro. It wasn’t my plan but I have since lost more weight than I had before. I used to fast and eat keto as well. It’s a lot of work and it takes a long time to reverse the insulin resistance naturally and it’s not permanent either unless you do it very early in diagnosis (doesn’t include those who went undiagnosed for years). I didn’t want to believe it wasn’t progressive but for me it is. Maybe not if you can manage stress well. I don’t have any complications but meds have been great for me. My A1C naturally never got below 5.2 and is now 4.9 with mounjaro, so I’ll be on this as long as I can be.

I'm simply briefly sharing my journey so far. I was diagnosed at 12.4 a1c... Fasting was 20 mmol. I took no meds.. my doctor was not happy. 🥴 My 3 months is coming up end of September. So a few weeks. My fasting numbers are anywhere from 4.5-5.4 mmol.. was like this from 1 week in when I got my meter. The only thing I've changed in my diet is from that day I've had no juice, pop or sugary drinks. I don't stack my meals. I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't really snack at all. And when I tell you guys I was an INSANE abuser of juice and sugary drinks. For context I would drink 2 L bottle of juice in a few hours and that wouldn't take into account if I ate something else that came with a drink. I would mix different juices and pop together. When I was diagnosed it was no surprise I simply just said well I did this to myself. Drinking water was a foreign concept to me. Also I had constant urination at the start of the month I was diagnosed. I found out on a Thursday and the urination went away 2 days later. So by Sunday I noticed I didn't get up at night to pee 3 times minimum. Also my eyes went blurry after diagnosis and that lasted two weeks. Everything has been back to normal now. I did a diabetic eye test and everything came back clean. I obsessively tested with finger pricks. At first i would be doing 60min, 90min, 2hr and 2.5 hr so I could understand the curve of the meals I ate. I've charted everything with chatgpt to share with my endocrinologist follow up in a few weeks. With all of that being said I've tested some VERY risky foods for diabetics and I rarely see a spike to/above 8.0 mmol within the 60-90 min mark. And within 2-2.5hrs I'm back to mid 5.5 mmol or lower. Sometimes 4s. All my meals have carbs except breakfast when I usually sometimes have a protein shake or maybe just start my day with lunch. I've charted 120 grams of carbs in a meal before. As OP mentioned the only time I saw a fasting in the 6 was when I had the cold/flu. Was about 2 days then back to down. I should also mention I lost about 30 lbs in less than 10 weeks. I did no exercise. No post meal walks or anything. My body has always been very responsive to dieting changes and I also gain muscle very fast when I do work out in the gym. I do plan on getting back in the gym after my 3 months update. I was at 230 ish and now I'm at 195 as of today. I'm 5'11. I do know my A1C is now atleast at 7.1 mmol. I tested at shoppers drug Mart 6/7 weeks in my journey. So we will see where I'm at end of this month. My energy and feel for life has changed so much I am honestly thankful for this diagnosis I feel like I've saved my own life and changed the direction I was going in which was most likely an early grave. Most people see this diagnosis as the end of life.. for me it was the start of mine. I will never return to that version who was slowly killing himself. I'm also still very new and not sure what all of this means.
5. u/Wall-Live [score=6, created=2025-09-07T06:44:29]: This is a solid question and discussion. I can eat some carbs but never on an empty stomach. I cloth my carbs with fat, scotch, exercise. Each work differently. I don’t got overboard. Example French fries. I’ll each 5-10 and be done. Scratches the itch doesn’t cause a spike. Your new normal is likely healthier than you had been in a long time.
6. u/anneg1312 [score=6, created=2025-09-07T05:07:26]: My experience has been that once my bg was normal, I still had to correct insulin resistance. This takes longer and for me, required more significant intermittent fasting. Once that was better, my glucose response is pretty normal as long as I don’t go overboard either in number of carbs or elevated carbs for too long. I’m still fine tuning…. Look… it’s a living system and what “normies” eat carb-wise is higher than humans should be consuming. Breaking the system makes it more sensitive to the abuse of carb load and everyone is different in what they can process. I suspect that given enough time of normal bg combined with intermittent fasting and most of time being in nutritional ketosis allows the body to heal enough to be able to process more carbs normally… but not a big amount for long periods (that would easily kick you back into insulin resistance). I intend to test this theory thoroughly over time :)
7. u/KerryBoehm [score=3, created=2025-09-07T04:58:04]: I was diagnosed in April. My a1c was 9.5. I immediately got a stick meter and tested 2 hrs after every meal. Anything which put me over 180 I stopped eating. I already exercised far more than suggested. I’m now down to 6.1. Of course these changes will need to be followed for the rest of my days and one day they too may no longer work. Many people can do it but require discipline. Many others are beyond lifestyle and will die without meds.
8. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=5, created=2025-09-07T02:00:11]: Low 5‘s A1C and rarely spike with no meds. I still have dawn phenomenon, but to lesser extent (it’s my current war to crush it if I can) than I used to and I can certainly eat more carbs in a day than at the start without seeing any real spike in my glucose after a year and a half of going low carb. Sometimes I eat something and I‘m surprised at how little it moves the needle and then occasionally it’s whoa slow down. Do I think if I eat like I used to I’d see no spikes and everything is back to normal as it was when I was younger? No. I know if I push it I’m going back, but I still call it reversed since my numbers moved back to non-diabetic range. I liken it to weight loss (for me), if I go back to eating the way I used to I’ll certainly gain all the weight I lost and all those complications that are possible will come back.
9. u/SargeMaximus [score=4, created=2025-09-06T22:27:30]: I can eat carbs. I do some hacks that seem to help. I’m also very skinny. Been normal BG for over a year. No meds
10. u/slaveofacat [score=6, created=2025-09-06T21:37:23]: For me, with a now "normal" bg and a1c, it still looks the same for me as it did at diagnosis. I'm not in remission by any means, if I eat something carb heavy or processed to the heavens, I still spike. It's still about controlling my diet more than anything. And, I'm honestly scared to eat "normally". I don't want to slide back into bad habits, I don't have major cravings anymore, I'm happy with my alternatives; why mess with what's working? Just my take though, YMMV.
