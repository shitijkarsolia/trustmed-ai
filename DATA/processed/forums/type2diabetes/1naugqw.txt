===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with T2D last April. Officially in remission since last December. Wanted to hear the thoughts from the community on the following: 1. My BG typically stays between a range of 50 points. Between 85 - 135 / 95 - 145 ( Based on how active I am in the current week). Should I do something to reduce this or this seems alright 2. When I am playing squash my BG typically raises to 160/170 and the comes down to baseline in an hour or so. Is this something to worry about or it's a natural response. PS: I shared this with my endo and she was happy with the results. But people on Instagram / reddit keep commenting that we should maintain a very tight range for best results so confused here.

2. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=2, created=2025-09-08T04:34:17]: Your numbers actually look really good, especially given that your endocrinologist is happy with them. A 50-point swing is pretty normal. blood sugar isn’t meant to stay at one number all day, it naturally moves with meals, activity, and stress. Exercise (like squash) can cause a temporary rise because your body releases stress hormones to fuel your muscles, and as you noticed, it comes back down quickly on its own. That’s a healthy response. Some people online aim for very tight ranges, but what really matters is overall stability, avoiding frequent big spikes, and keeping your A1C in a safe range, which you’ve already done. It sounds like you’re managing things really well.

4. u/Erza88 [score=5, created=2025-09-07T11:51:03]: From what I understand, even people without diabetes can spike to the 180s depending on what they eat. What's important is that your numbers return to baseline after 2hrs. The danger of high blood sugar is not necessarily the spike, it's how long it stays high. Like the other redditor said, though, trust the professional!
