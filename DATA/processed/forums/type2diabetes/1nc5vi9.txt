===============================================================================

Hi all, I'm a 45 yo Aspergers who has for much of adult life been in the pre-diabetic range. I'm seeing a new PCP in the south who is definitely interesting (maybe Rogan-like) who saw increase in 3-straight years - still in the prediabetic range - and put me on Metformin. Cholesteral also. 500mg 2x day. I started taking about 6 weeks ago. I was 6-2, 225 when I started, now I am 205 and dropping. Weight loss is good, but the reduction of neck and back pain I never really knew I had is enormous. What is most notable is cognitive function. I feel like I have leveled up in a video game. Attention, focus, organization all a clearly and notably improved. Production skyrocked. I can sing and play instruments better. This feels like Limitless. Or when Theodin got healed by Gandalf. Yikes. What is happening here? I have not really researched this much but I'd love any feedback, I appreciate it.

I have type 2 diabetes and was also diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome 20 years ago (I disagree with this diagnosis, I believe atypical autism) The influence of blood sugar levels is great and extends throughout the body. The pains you experienced are probably of neural origin. For me, the decrease in sugar was marked by the disappearance of hypertensive crises
