I drank some juice and was at 120 in a few mins. I get low after I work out. I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago. My starting glucose (not fasting) was 357 and I freaked out. 3 weeks later I’m at 150 2 hours after I eat NO MEDS! I refused insulin and metformin. I did the immediate high fiber, high good fats and high protein diet. I skip breakfast and I exercise but I dip really low after I work out.

3. u/Subject_Singer_4514 [score=1, created=2025-09-15T09:23:39]: I was diagnosed 22 years ago. I have never had a time when my BG went too low. I have no complications and feel healthy. I take 2 grams of Metformin ER each day. This has never caused me a dangerous BG low even when I have skipped breakfast and lunch because I was so busy. However, I remember feeling pretty fatigued after not eating all day and that I felt so much better after having salmon and brussels sprouts.

5. u/Shinkai2008 [score=4, created=2025-09-10T07:20:06]: I used to be like that when I used to eat 3-5 times a day. But after slowly moving into an intermittent fasting way of eating, I don't get those lows anymore but maintain normal sugar levels till next eating period. Right now I do OMAD Mon-Fri and 2MAD Sat/Sun and it's been working out great for me and totally sustainable for my living style.
6. u/Sassy-Me86 [score=2, created=2025-09-09T21:38:22]: I started getting headaches when I start to drop. I thankfully haven't had severe drops like when it was gestational diabetes, and I was on insulin. I had 3 major drops. But now I get a headache, and I'm like oh yea ... I should eat I guess 😅
7. u/ott2k6 [score=2, created=2025-09-09T19:47:45]: That's me when my sugar is too low. Like 3.8mmol/L low.
8. u/alittlediabetic [score=3, created=2025-09-09T18:52:10]: LMAO thats what I used to be like before my diagnosis, actually! Not so much anymore!
