===============================================================================

I was talking with a team of researchers about diabetes and I got people mad. They had a very strong stance and corrected me that I used the term diabetics. I was told that I must say people with diabetes and never use that term again. I wonder, does it really matter to you guys?

2. u/khaotickharisma [score=2, created=2025-09-13T06:47:48]: I literally just called myself a diabetic 3 mins ago. It literally is what it is. People these days are just super sensitive.
3. u/KerryBoehm [score=1, created=2025-09-12T11:22:50]: I’ve been called far worse. Didn’t know this was a thing
4. u/Bliss2Jessie [score=1, created=2025-09-11T21:02:25]: It matters. But they should be a little bit more gentle to you when telling you this. All the new docs I’ve met recently have referred to people as diabetics. I’m not diabetic (oops, I mean I don’t have diabetes), but my husband wants to keep his secret and kinda deny it. It’s “the man“ trying to tell him what to do. Yeah, the wounds that don’t heal (he thinks they’re from repeated injuries), the burning feet (TBI as a Green Beret), the clot in one eye that means he has to get a shot in his eye every couple of months (he hasn’t given an excuse yet), the ED (no excuse given), the being pissed off all the time... He is not stupid. He just has stupidies.
5. u/Putertutor [score=2, created=2025-09-10T11:07:36]: It's likely a part of the new(er) "people first" language thing. Just like you would say "person of color" as opposed to "colored person" or "boy with down syndrome" as opposed to "the down syndrome boy." when describing someone. It's a politically correct thing, I think. I have seen it addressed in trainings as a teacher.

7. u/mYstiSagE [score=11, created=2025-09-09T20:45:32]: Yeah, F them because "people with diabetes" are diabetics. Jeez, that is just ridiculous.
8. u/ac7ss [score=7, created=2025-09-09T19:27:38]: Having diabetes does not define a person. They are not a diabetic any more than they are a sports fanatic or bus driver. Some people get upset about this. I don't care.
9. u/alan_s [score=14, created=2025-09-09T19:09:52]: Semantics. I've never understood why some folks get bothered about it. It has never bothered me.
10. u/Pedal2Medal2 [score=5, created=2025-09-09T18:44:01]: Language changes all the time; 2 yrs from now they could change it back
11. u/anneg1312 [score=6, created=2025-09-09T18:43:47]: Doesn’t matter to me even a little bit. What kind of researchers were these???
12. u/islandjaq [score=11, created=2025-09-09T16:59:03]: Doesn’t matter if people call me “drop dead sexy” or “person who is of really really really good lookingness” either is fine
13. u/mrnoonan81 [score=11, created=2025-09-09T15:51:08]: As a diabetic, I would be offended if you called me a person with diabetes.
14. u/vape-o [score=13, created=2025-09-09T15:47:24]: Oh for God’s sake, your words are just fine and the researchers need to stop worrying about words and worry more about cures.
15. u/arguix [score=1, created=2025-09-09T14:40:26]: why? is it too close to dianetics? or does it mean type one? what is the issue?
16. u/curiousbato [score=3, created=2025-09-09T14:09:01]: This has happened to me once or twice when speaking with health care professionals. It really doesn't make a difference to me. If anything, it's easier/quicker to say "I'm diabetic" than saying "I live with diabetes". As others have said, I think it has more to do with being "politically correct" if that makes sense?
17. u/OneLaneHwy [score=10, created=2025-09-09T14:08:52]: Sure, language matters. But not like that. The only reason they want you to use "person first" language is so they can "correct" you and make themselves seem superior to you.
18. u/CreativeChaos2023 [score=8, created=2025-09-09T14:05:46]: A lot of professionals like to push person first language as a way of allegedly showing you’re more than your disability or health condition. I use a wheelchair and prefer identity first (disabled person not person with a disability) as do most other disabled people I know. I don’t want to clog up this thread but I can point to some resources that explain it if you want. I hadn’t really thought about it specifically for diabetes. I refer to myself as a diabetic or having diabetes.
19. u/k_princess [score=1, created=2025-09-09T13:56:55]: Person-first language is supposed to be used for those with disabilities.
