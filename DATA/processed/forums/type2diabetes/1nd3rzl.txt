===============================================================================

First time posting and have lived with diabetes for about three years. So three years ago I was officially diagnosed as diabetic and was prescribed Ozempic which was doing pretty well until I got Covid a couple years ago. My A1C shot up and raising the dosage of Ozempic did barely anything to help. Since then I’ve started Mounjaro and my A1C went from 7.9 to 6.2! But I just got diagnosed with Covid again. I’m scared of the process/roller coaster starting all over again. Was the Covid the only thing that changed about my life back in 2023 that could have affected my diabetes? Definitely not. Do I want to risk this happening again without preparing? Oh he** no. I’m asking my doctor about what to do or if she’s seen this before, but I thought I’d ask here as well. Thanks!

2. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=2, created=2025-09-10T08:04:24]: It’s understandable to feel worried, you’re definitely not alone. Infections like Covid can temporarily raise blood sugar because your body releases stress hormones that make you more resistant to insulin. That’s why many people with diabetes notice higher readings during illness, even if their meds were working well before. The good news is that these spikes are usually temporary and often settle once your body recovers, especially since you’ve had such a strong response to Mounjaro. Preparing ahead (hydration, close glucose monitoring, staying in touch with your doctor, and having a “sick day plan” for diabetes management) can really help lessen the roller coaster. It’s great that you’re already planning to discuss this with your doctor, they can adjust things if needed while you’re sick.

4. u/heylookachicken [score=1, created=2025-09-09T22:22:14]: That's funny you mention this. I was on a downward trend until I got COVID, then it's gone up. Just started mounjaro and noticing some improvement as well.
