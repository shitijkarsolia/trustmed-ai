I’ve noticed fasting blood sugars can sometimes be the hardest to manage. For those with type 2, what’s worked best for keeping your morning numbers steady?

I stop eating after 7pm (that's when I start my fast) and avoid any heavy carb laden food when I have dinner (usually around 6pm). Unfortunately we can't post pictures here, but my readings are pretty normal between 7pm and 7am. I see a slight bump when I wake-up but then they stabilize. BTW I do take a slow-acting insulin as part of my therapy and I am on insulin.

That way, I wake up to numbers in the mid 80s. I'm a grab &amp; go kind of person so, for me, that looks like a small apple, a slice of cheese, and 10 plain almonds. If I stray too far from that balance, I spike and then crash.

5. u/gertymoon [score=3, created=2025-09-10T09:51:56]: I try to either take a walk or a jog in the evening after dinner, if I run my numbers are vastly improved in the morning compared to just taking a walk.
6. u/SmaugTheMagnificent [score=1, created=2025-09-10T09:25:34]: Mine also spikes around 3am. I've found that taking a walk before breakfast (ie. while fasted). Or like today having to drive 1.5 hours to the office brought my numbers from ~135 to ~100
7. u/ShopNerd [score=2, created=2025-09-10T08:55:27]: Im under the belief I get the "dawn phenomenon" just about daily i can see with my CGM that I spike usually around 3 am most days and slowly come down. To combat this my breakfast has changed to low or no carbs depending on where my day starts at. I usually have eggs on toast or an apple with yogurt but ill cut back on the toast or apple if I start high. Just eggs and hot sauce or yogurt and keto granola seems to do the trick ok.
