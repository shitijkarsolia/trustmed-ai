===============================================================================

Recently diagnosed with T2D. Over the course of three months, my A1C went from 14.5 to 6.1, 167lbs to 155 and am 5’7” (height didn’t change unfortunately LOL). Anyway, I still don’t quite understand carbs on labels. I realize I am to stay away from boxed food items to avoid “bad carbs” and I do. I spend my time looking for low carbs and no sugar (or very little) but I am afraid that I am not recognizing if I may be missing “good “ carbs. It would be awesome if labels just said something like: Carbs 20g (15 good and 5 bad). Is there a rule of thumb I should use? While I am showing good results on paper, I am really just doing things haphazardly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

That is important because in the USA fibre (aka fiber) is lumped in with carbs in the nutrition count while in most other countries it is listed separately. For that reason fibre must be deducted to see the actual carbs in the USA but not elsewhere. &gt;While I am showing good results on paper, I am really just doing things haphazardly. Any help would be greatly appreciated. In any case the best method is to use nutrition labels as just a guide when selecting foods the first time but your meter as the judge to determine whether to include that food next time and the appropriate portion size if you do.

Fiber is not readily converted to glucose and absorbed into the blood, so it's the net carbs number that matters most. Outside the US fibre (with an 're') is listed separately from readily absorbable carbs, so the 'total carbohydrates' figure on a European food label for example is equivalent to 'net carbs' in the US context. 'Good carbs' for a Type 2 are ones which are digested slowly, as that gives the pancreas more time to release the necessary insulin to handle the carbs entering the bloodstream from the intestine. Generally speaking the best carbs come from whole foods like whole grains, veg and nuts - foods where the carbs are locked up with other nutrients which delay the digestion of the carbs - fibre, fat and protein. The best available indication of this is the 'glycemic index' (GI) of a food. You can find information about the GI of various foods online. In reality though it's as much about quantity as it is about how 'good' the carbs are. A large amount of 'good' carbs in a meal will cause a bigger spike than a small amount of sugar. For me personally a meal with a lot of brown rice is worse than a moderate portion of ice cream. There's much more starch in a pile of rice than there is sugar in a couple of scoops of creamy ice cream, and the fat in the ice cream helps to delay digestion, stimulate incretin hormones and so suppress the spike. The complexity of all this is why testing your blood before and two hours after a meal is useful. It provides real world information about how well your body handled the carbs in a specific meal. This allows you to learn over time which meals and portions are 'good' and which are too much for your body to handle well, in which case you might need to tweak the portions of carbs in the meal.

Then there’s things like sugar alcohols that aren’t necessarily good but those that count net carbs subtract those as well as fiber from total carbs. IMO is best to keep total carbs lower while also paying attention to fiber.
