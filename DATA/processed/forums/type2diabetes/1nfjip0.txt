===============================================================================

Just trying to salvage this patch for a few more days. I’m on the last couple patches, and can’t afford to buy more as I just lost my job. I’m struggling over here as I don’t have a choice to not use one. I have a tumor on my adrenal gland that is causing me to sweat a LOT and it is humiliating to even have to admit. But I will say, a patch at least keeps the sensor on, but assuming the patch hangs on. If anyone can help, I will be so grateful.

I’ve done that before, and it was really worth it, especially if you’re on a tight budget. It’s a great way to see if they work well for you without spending extra.
