===============================================================================

I know this might sound whiny or something to some on here, and I want to apologize in advance for some of that. I know I’m in OK shape, but I’m really struggling the past couple weeks and wanted some advice or others experiences.. Diagnosed in early March at 7.1. First 3 month check got down to 5.0. Was so pumped. Did low carb, exercised, tested often (5-10x a day). My glucometer average reflected what my A1C was. An average of 98 I think. Through June, July, August I really switched to testing fasting and maybe 1 other time a day. So probably 6-10 tests a week. My fastings were always 80-100 ish. Some days a bit more than 100, but rarely and that was the highest. I have tried to somewhat loosen the reigns for sustainability, but have struggled with that mentally. Now - ever since September, my fasting are always above 100. About 15-25 points higher than they had been. I really am not doing anything different… maybe walking a bit less. But not noticeably so. I had a 125 this morning and I just kind of broke down. Like this was solid 80s-90s for weeks and now I feel like I’m sliding and lost any semblance of freedom I had - And I am still super low carb. My averages are still ok. And I have another blood test this week and expect that A1C to be ok at least although at this point it’s gotta be higher than 5.0. I just don’t want to backslide So my question to some in here is … Have you experienced anything similar? Why are my numbers for 14-15 days considerably higher with the same diet? And is there a chance they’ll go back to where they were? Do I need more drugs? I’m 750 mg metformin once a day rn. I have a doctors appointment next week and will ask as well. Just wanting some guidance.

It could be regular meals I eat all the time, but theres a different reaction and I swear its the period. Or the wind is blowing extra hard that day, I think theres so much that can through it off thats not within our control. As much as it messes w my head, and I get super frustrated sometimes, you got to ride it out.
2. u/alan_s [score=3, created=2025-09-15T18:04:20]: I must admit I stopped worrying about fasting blood glucose levels as long as they are in healthy range (4-8mmol/l ot 70-140mg/dl) many years ago. Its primary purpose was diagnosis, after that I see it as no different to any other BG test. I also suffer from [dawn phenomenon](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2009/02/i-ate-nothing-why-are-my-bgs-high.html) so I am happy if it is under 8(140). Your A1c is excellent. Are you seeing any post-meal peaks over 140(8)?
3. u/KerryBoehm [score=1, created=2025-09-15T15:52:48]: I had a similar experience and only conclusion I could come to was I was working 12 or more hrs a day and then getting friction from the spouse so every waking hr was just non stop stress.
4. u/RandomThyme [score=2, created=2025-09-15T15:36:16]: You've done great so far! Diabetes is a marathon and not a sprint though, so the changes that you made and continue to make need to be sustainable for the long term. There are so many factors that can affect our sugar levels: lack of or poor quality sleep, stress, illness, exercise, medications. Working about your numbers can have an impact on your numbers. As long as your time in range between 3.9mmol (70mg) &amp; 10mmol (180mg) is more than 70% and your A1c is below zero you are gaining the most risk reduction. If you are finding it difficult to maintain the changes to reach your targets, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate those targets. Something not quite so tight might make it easier to maintain over the long term. I would recommend getting a cgm. Abbott (Freestyle) has a program where you can get a trial sensor for free, you can find it on their website. Getting a cgm doesn't mean that you need to keep them for longer than the first sensor of you don't want to but having just one will provide you with some good data that can be much more difficult to capture with finger pokes alone. I was really skeptical about them and didn't think that I would like having one but it surprised me. I find that I like having it and it makes some things easier. I don't even notice the sensor when it's on. If you decide to keep them you can experiment with different placements, some people get great results with chest or thigh placements, then it is hidden from view.
5. u/vape-o [score=1, created=2025-09-15T14:54:36]: I have found following my blood sugar is somewhat like following the stock market. I go crazy when I have consistent mornings of 130-140 and don't notice my "normal" tests during the day. I have to keep reminding myself that what's really important is my A1c. Period. My testing is more to catch any dangerous highs or lows, and my day cannot be based on whether I was able to keep that tight control I want to ideally have 24/7
6. u/portal_to_nowhere99 [score=2, created=2025-09-15T08:12:40]: My fasting readings in the morning are consistently some of my highest over 24 hours (I wear a CGM). My blood sugar seems to spike as soon as I wake up and start moving around with or without eating. I’ve seen this referred to as dawn phenomenon or boots on the ground phenomenon. I used to freak out about my morning spike but I know now that it’s going to go up and then go back down quickly and it never goes completely out of range (at least not yet). Would also recommend trying a cgm as you really get a much better sense of what your body is doing.
7. u/Confident-Cellist-25 [score=1, created=2025-09-15T07:56:43]: If you can, get a CGM (I use the Libre 3+). It made such a difference. First, you only need to do a finger stick when something doesn’t seem right, but you get so much information about what affects your blood sugar. For me, super low carb didn’t help. Instead, adding the right kinds of carbs made a huge difference. That and getting my meds right. I meet with a diabetes specialist every month, and she has really helped me understand my condition and how to control it without it taking over my life.
