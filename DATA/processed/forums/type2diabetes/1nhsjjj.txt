===============================================================================

I’m just here to vent because I’m frustrated. I’m 94% in range per my Dexcom but still not happy with the occasional spikes. I was diagnosed about 4 months ago. I do not and have not taken insulin. Glipizide and metformin currently. I want a better medication but there seem to be none and the endo stepped my glipizide back from 10mg to 5mg and says I may be able to come off all together. She won’t prescribe GLP-1 because I’m 5’3 and 119lbs. My husband was convinced I had excess visceral fat but per our Dexa scans this morning my visceral fat is .49 percent—- besides gaining more muscle is there anything I can do. I’m working on my diet—- it’s mainly whole food, low carb. I’m also in the gym lifting heavy (for me heavy, lol). What meds are you lean diabetics taking?

2. u/miss_suzka [score=1, created=2025-09-16T03:14:32]: There is a lot you can do to address the spikes while still following your doctor’s advice re: medication. Some diabetes hacks might be helpful here! 1. Wait 4 hours between meals 2. Try vinegar at the start of a meal via salad dressing or shrug 3. Try modifying your meals to see what specifically is causing your glucose spikes 4. If you’re not using a CGM - try one for 2 weeks - they are really informative! 5. Yes, build more muscle 6. Try changing the order you eat your food. Protein &amp; fiber first always then carbs
3. u/alittlediabetic [score=2, created=2025-09-15T20:54:00]: How high are your spikes? What do your plates usually look like when you have a meal? Do you eat fast or graze?
4. u/According_Bear_6599 [score=1, created=2025-09-15T19:48:25]: I’m 5’2” and 100lbs. I’m as lean as they get. Diabetic for 6 years. (Now almost 38). Leading up to my period, I spike like crazy and stay high. The rest of the month I am pretty good. 2000mg of metformin daily for me. I workout, lots of cardio (biking and walking), and try not to stress about the peaks. I also don’t really track my cycle so it’s usually me getting frustrated, going for a super long walk and then realizing why my blood sugar won’t stabilize.

There’s more to investigate including as another said, cortisol, to which I would add thyroid, testosterone, growth hormone. I’m not sure what in range means but the main reason for a lean diabetic to use a CGM is to double check the A1c. Beyond this, there is more to consider such as nutraceuticals, sleep, stress, and a few other hacks only for the lean diabetic. Edit: prediabetic to diabetic

Use your Dexcom to improve those spikes: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

8. u/Wiserestman97 [score=3, created=2025-09-15T13:30:05]: I'm not diabetic but I was almost prediabetic. My entire family has history of diabetes so its really easy for my glucose to spike or drop. What helps me the most is: -eat a couple pieces of veggie before each meal as it helps with glucose spike as it has fiber. -drink metamucile before meal if its easier rather than veggies or do both up to you. -talk to your doctor about taking CoQ-10 supplements, it helps those who are predisposed to metabolic syndrome which plays with diabetes. -eat slower, chew longer, use a smaller spoon, fork or smaller plate. Eating slower helps with glucose spike and metabolic syndrome. -walk after eating or dont lay down right away. Try standing or sitting up right or do smt that makes your heart rate above resting. Doesn't need to me over 100 bpm but just enough to get your blood flowing -eat protein first when you eat if anything as it helps slow digestion and switch out to carbs with fiber. You want to slow your digestion to help with glucose spike. I eat brown rice as it has more fiber. -gain lean muscle mass. More muscle the better. Which requires more protein. Hope it helps

10. u/curiousbato [score=12, created=2025-09-15T11:45:37]: Just a friendly reminder that spikes are totally normal and happen to every single human on earth. Spikes are just part of how our bodies work. If you want to focus your efforts on something focus on getting a stable and low A1C. You can stop worrying about your spikes. :)
11. u/tfunk024 [score=2, created=2025-09-15T11:19:23]: No meds, but you may want to look into some supplements to help support overall pancreatic health and improve your insulin resistance.
12. u/K9CatSprinkles [score=5, created=2025-09-15T10:54:54]: I’m not taking any medication. Just change in diet and same as you, I do strength training twice a week at the moment. Numbers are heading in the right direction.
13. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=10, created=2025-09-15T10:53:37]: &gt; I’m 94% in range per my Dexcom but still not happy &gt; besides gaining more muscle is there anything I can do. Learning to be happy with being in range 94% of the time is a valid option.
