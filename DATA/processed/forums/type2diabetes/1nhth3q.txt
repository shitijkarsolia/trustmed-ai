===============================================================================

Hey all I am 30F diagnosed with T2 diabetes 2 years ago. I had GD when pregnant with my daughter 4 years ago. Normal sugar levels after for 2 yrs then within 6 months I was diagnosed with prediabetes 3 months after they returned to normal then within weeks became diabetic. Anyway since then I went from 2 500mg of metformin a day well controlled with A1cs coming back at 44-47. Then all of a sudden I become uncontrolled and had to up my metformin to 2000mg a day. Back to good sugar levels. Dast forward 6 months meds stopped working so we added gliclazide to the mix. 40mg twice a day. Back to being controlled with a hba1c of 41 (non diabetic levels)....over the moon. To all of a sudden about 7 weeks ago my sugar levels completely uncontrolled again so I started 80mg of gliclazide twice a day and I am over a month in of taken 2000mg of metformin 80mg twice a day of glic and nothing is working my sugars are higher then ever. My question is why am I becoming insulin resistant even more when I haven't changed anything. I try eat as well as possible, I am moving around a lot in the day at work. Sometimes I can get it down to around 9mmoll at night and wake up with them at 13mmoll. I am less than 5% in range on my dexcom and it's accurate I've been checking against my finger pricker. The hospital are currently doing lots of different tests on me to make sure it's T2 I'm pretty sure it is with a family history of T2. They are even discussing starting me on insulin. What is Happening!? Has anyone had an experience like this? Thank you for taking your time to read.

Hormones change your sensitivity to both insulin and food so it might be worth getting some tests to check your hormones both when you are "normal" and when you are "uncontrolled" so they can compare. I was put on medication to help level out my sugar levels by getting more level hormones. Having comparisons of full blood tests from when you are "normal" and when you are "uncontrolled" can also help to determine other causes from any changes.

If not I suggest you ask your doctor for testing. Different types need different treatment. While you wait to discusss that with the doctor please expand on: &gt; I try eat as well as possible, I know you are already low carb but use your meter at your peak (probably about an hour after eating) to see if it agrees with you: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

In regards to diet/exercise, Diabetes fatigue seems to be a common thing based on this sub. People become very strict with diet, exercise, meds, etc, then after a year or more, they slip up....then it becomes a slippery slope.
