===============================================================================

I recently made my first post sharing how I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Quick recap: I went to see my doctor because I wanted to quit smoking, only to find out that I was diabetic. That moment changed everything. I started focusing on my condition and dove into researching diabetes. One thing I began noticing (something I’d never paid attention to before) is the convenience store. I live in Canada, and here we have a law that requires cigarettes to be hidden from view behind the counter. The packs also feature prominently displayed graphic health warnings. It’s clear these rules are in place to protect public health, and I’m totally fine with that. I don’t have an issue with it. But since being diagnosed, I’ve realized that most items in convenience stores aren’t suitable for diabetics. For example, not long after my diagnosis, I went to the store to grab some milk. As I looked around, right next to the milk fridge were soft drinks, energy drinks, sugary juices, and beer, with just a small section off to the side for bottled water (almost like an afterthought). Then I started looking at the products on the shelves, and almost all of them were bad for diabetes. As I walked toward the cashier, I saw the front of the counter packed with candies, rows and rows of them. I couldn’t help but think to myself, “I could kill myself in here. LOL.”

I'm just starting to make stuff at home, so I can fully control what's in it. I made these [blueberry bars](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1nkgw4j/random_madness_september_18_2025_recipe_blueberry/) not too long ago and they are delicious! Gives you all the sweetness you could ask for but better than store bought.

I read that it would take 8 oranges today to get the same vitamins and nutrients from 1 orange back in 1960. Our food has been manipulated. Think about milk. Just something so simple right? We have been told our entire lives it’s good for us. It’s NOT! We are drinking breast milk from another species. Cows arw HUGE animals. It’s for baby cows to get HUGE. How is that healthy for humans? It’s barely food anymore. It’s all about mass production and growing food as fast as possible. The seeds are so bioengineered. Then you have all this sugar. Sugar is in so many foods. It’s also very expensive to eat healthy. My food bill was insane to begin with but it’s almost doubled now for all fresh fruits and vegetables. It’s just sad. They’re killing us on purpose.
4. u/tbrando1994 [score=4, created=2025-09-16T01:31:45]: You also have to ask yourself “why are the candy, cookies, junk, ect up by the register/cashier”, anyway? I mean, the food aisle is where are this food should be—-yet, they also put it AGAIN up by the register to taunt you to buy the “impulsive items”. The marketing that these business’ do rely on solid psychological studies that show the human behavior is predictable and easily manipulated. There is a reason most “impulse buy items” are at a certain height—-the height of a small child. A small child will coax their parents to getting whatever is by that cashier. It’s done on purpose. If you look around, we are being manipulated from the fact that this so-called-food (it’s actually non-food that is not real food) is plentiful and down to how it is made with three main addictive ingredients: sugar, salt and fat in copious amounts. This is so you will never feel satiated and will increase your dopamine hits so much that they will dull over time and you will need more and more all the time. If you think about it, landing on the other side of diabetes can be a blessing in disguise as we are actually becoming aware that things must change. We must eat real food and not to go overboard. We have to live against the grain of how 80% of the rest of the population (that probably has undiagnosed metabolic syndrome too unknowingly) lives yet we have an active advantage to stop the progression. It’s sad what has collectively happened to the world. It’s sad that we have to fight against what is being thrown at us at all times to consume. The worst is that there is more type 2 diabetes across the board than at any time in history and the population is getting younger and younger. 😩

6. u/RandomThyme [score=3, created=2025-09-15T15:13:02]: How do you afford milk at the convenience store? I live in Watern Cansda and a gallon of milk is usually easily at leat $1-2 more than the grocery store. Some of the 7/11 around me have some measly and questionable quality veggie cups with ranch. Usually just carrots &amp; celery sticks. But most of them offer a selection of nuts so that it what I would get. Usually, due to the expensive prices, I avoid convenience stores like the plague. They are about convenience not health.
7. u/Generations18 [score=5, created=2025-09-15T14:16:08]: I work in such a store. We have exactly ONE snack I could eat. Its the cookie and cream quest bar so that works for me). the diet soda section is so small it runs out a few times a week. I work in the kitchen, and its all fried food, burgers pizza etc. My levels have actually dropped to normal since I started here but only because I rarely eat here.
8. u/OneLaneHwy [score=10, created=2025-09-15T12:49:31]: I live in the USA. The number and variety of packaged foods that have added salt and added sugar is astounding. Frozen foods and other foods packaged in boxes, bags, aluminum cans, glass jars, and plastic jars — it's hard to find any without a ton of salt or a ton of sugar or both. Why does *fruit juice* need **added** sugars?!? Our federal government is going after artificial dies and ingredients, and that's good. But I suspect added salt and sugar are an even worse problem for public health.
