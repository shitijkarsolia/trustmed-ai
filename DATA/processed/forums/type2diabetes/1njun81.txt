Diagnosed about 6 mos ago. Give me some easy snack options that won’t spike my blood sugar. Anybody find a protein bar they like?

Sometimes I'll have broccoli, or cauliflower with a home made Red Wine Vinaigrette dressing (compared to store brands, home made is better as there is no added sugars). For protein bars, I like the Kirkland brand (Kirkland Signature Chewy Protein Bars 42 × 40 g). 180 calories per serving, 16g of carbs but 10g of protein. Before this, I was buying Kind but they had more calories, fat, carbs and less protein in them.
5. u/PacRimRod [score=3, created=2025-09-18T09:17:02]: Beef jerky, premier protein 30g protein shakes, 1g sugar, walnuts and almonds, a quick scrambled eggs or hard boiled are my go to's.
6. u/JEngErik [score=3, created=2025-09-17T20:16:32]: Boiled eggs, home made jerky, home made fruit leather, raw veggies, home made pickles, nuts (not legumes aka peanuts), seeds (pumpkin, etc), . I don't snack much but these are my go to when the mood strikes.
7. u/Equivalent-Yoghurt38 [score=3, created=2025-09-17T18:45:48]: Chomps meat sticks, Catalina Crunch snack mix (the spicy has a great kick!), hard boiled eggs with everything but the bagel seasoning, cherry tomatoes w/ drizzle of olive oil and salt + cheese (I always have string cheese and fresh mozzarella in the fridge), cottage cheese with sriracha or hot sauce, carrot sticks and guacamole (I buy the Trader Joe’s singles of guac) I find that most highly processed foods spike me more than almost anything else. So I stick to mostly whole fresh foods and things that are minimally processed.
8. u/Sweaty-Atmosphere248 [score=2, created=2025-09-17T18:26:06]: My go-to snacks since diagnosis in June have been: Peanuts or peanut butter Jack Links beef sticks and pepper jack cheese (19g protein per pack) Quest cookie dough bars (20g protein per bar) Core Power protein vanilla or chocolate. Either 26g or 42g varieties Sugar free Jello Sugar free Hershey bars Low sugar/No added sugar apple sauce Berries, watermelon, bananas, grapes Hope this helps
