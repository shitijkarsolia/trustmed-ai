===============================================================================

On August 14th, I went for my physical with my primary care. My A1C and sugar level was check, my A1C was 7.7 which was an increase from 7.3 on January 29th. I had a conversation with my primary care and I admitted that I hadn't been taking Trulicity he prescribed me because I was scared of needles and I would've needed to be injecting myself three times a week. My doctor didn't get mad at me, he instead decided to change my injections from Trulicity to mounjaro which made it so I only needed to inject myself once a week and I agreed to it. The process did take a little since they needed to wait for approval from my insurance, then sent prior authorization to my pharmacy and I finally picked up my pens on September 10th and started them first day. The first week I started the injection I was very nauseous and for several days I got waves of very bad stomach aches, I would go through one if I ate too much or a big meal and immediately develop very bad aches if i was hungry to the point the pain would wake me up and I couldn't lay down to sleep so I obviously had to have tums and pepto on standby which helped a little, my breath also tasted like rotten eggs which made it uncomfortable. I didn't fully recover until Tuesday and I once again took my second injection today which for some reason did make me bleed a little this time and the injection side did hurt afterwards but honestly i wasn't as nauseous as the first time and I haven't gotten worsening stomach pains. What has been everyone's experience with mounjaro?

My first week was similar to yours, I had zero appetite, felt nauseous, and also had flu symptoms. It got better after two weeks. Nowadays I don’t really have any side effects, outside of the occasional constipation, but getting plenty of fiber and taking a magnesium citrate pill fixed that. I’ve lost 105 lbs since March and my A1C last month was 5.2. I’ve never seen my blood sugar spike over 140 yet with any meal I’ve eaten. My appetite is still very low and I have practically zero issues with sticking to a healthy diet. I hate to use the phrase miracle drug, but it really has changed my life. I don’t mind taking this drug for the rest of my life if I need to. I recommend sticking with it for at least the full month to see if it gets better. A bit of advice for the injections, make sure you let the shot sit outside of the fridge for an hour or so before you take the injection and you probably won’t even feel it. Taking it straight from the fridge always hurts a little due to the cold liquid.

And yeah, glp 1s can be rough at first, sometimes your doctor will be fine with slowing down the increases, just to give your system more time to get used to it. I had trouble at first but no issues at all now.

But, to answer your question, Mounjaro can be a rocky start, but if you give it time, it should work for you with minimal side effects. Works best if you also keep to a low carb diet and eat small portions. The more you don't do that, the more side effects you'll likely have.
4. u/unitacx [score=1, created=2025-09-17T23:33:42]: Huh? The recommended dosage frequency for Trulicity is once a week, same as Mounjaro. Both have a half-life of \~5 days. Trulicity and Mounjaro have a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Mounjaro also has a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. Mounjaro is reportedly more effective at weight loss as a result of the GLP-1 - GIP combination (which appears to be the only distinction). Given the peculiar dosage for Trulicity, I'm wondering if the GP followed recommendations of titrating up to the present dosage. It's common to start with a minimum dose, but if already taking a GLP-1 drug, base the initial dose on the prior GLP-1 dose. Then only after the GLP-1 is agreeable for at least 4 weeks, incrementally increase the dose. An endocrinologist would be able to work out a regimen that would be effective and agreeable to you and probably avoid the digestive distress you are describing. Of note, Lilly's autoinjectors (single dose, e.g., US market) have gone from about a 29 G needle to a (thinner) 31 G needle at about the end of 2024, so the injections should become less of a problem.
