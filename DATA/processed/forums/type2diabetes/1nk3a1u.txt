===============================================================================

I was diag'd back in May. My A1C had been slowly inching up for the past few years, from 5.3. At May's checkup, it was 6.9, so full-on Type 2. Came home and started watching YouTube vids from Berry and Davis (I also have Celiac, and some mild IBS). Cut the carbs, and basically went to ZERO alcohol, Zero sugar, Zero starches, or as close as I could get. Lost 20lbs, have another 40 to go (at least) to get me under 200. A1C At Home kit showed 6.9 when I first tested with it back in June, so figured that was a good baseline as it agreed with my labwork. Latest test was 5.3, so good, solid progress there. Morning numbers are high, so guessing part of that is the Predawn crap that others experience. Just now I was at 140. I've been doing OMAD fasting. Checked BG yesterday at 5:30 before eating, and was at 97, lowest I've ever tested, but I've never tested at that time, either. VA doesn't cover CGMs unless you're on insulin, which I am not, and they only cover 50 test strips every 180 days (I'll be buying my own soon so I can test more frequently). It can be frustrating to nail things down, given the Celiac and IBS. I came home yesterday and had a fresh tomato after I tested, and in 15mins had major gut cramps, so off to the bathroom. From a freakin' TOMATO. My evening "treat" is a bowl of berries with some SIBO yogurt, sweetened with Allulose. The SIBO is pretty amazing, and can definitely feel an impact from consuming that. Chips are my downfall, both potato and corn. I had a handful of chips last night before bed, which I suspect was part of my 140 reading this morning. Really wanted to say thank you to the community here. It's such a great resource, and can definitely provide some inspiration.

1. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=1, created=2025-09-18T19:37:27]: That’s incredible progress bringing your A1C down from 6.9 to 5.3 in just a few months is no small accomplishment. The morning spikes you’re seeing are very likely the dawn phenomenon, which many people with T2 experience regardless of how disciplined they are with food. Keeping evening snacks lower in carbs or higher in protein/fiber sometimes helps smooth those numbers. With Celiac and IBS in the mix, your gut reactions make it trickier, but you’re clearly finding strategies that work. Staying consistent, using your own strips to track patterns, and leaning on the progress you’ve already made will go a long way.

This should help you use those strips systematically: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) If the cost is a significant problem this might also help: [Testing on a Budget](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2007/04/teting-on-budget.html)

It's only been 3 or 4 months so don't put more pressure on yourself: it took us a while to get here so it takes a lot less time to come back down but not by snapping your fingers. Your little splurge for tomatoes or chips for me is ice cream: fortunately and it’s a chance to be able to indulge in small pleasures. Regarding health insurance, we are already lucky to have coverage and everyone needs it. You have to deal with that to do the best you can. I have never been able to test allulose: it is not authorized in France I believe. We are slow! But I can't wait. In any case, good luck and good luck for your efforts.
