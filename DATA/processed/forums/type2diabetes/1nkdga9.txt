===============================================================================

hey everyone doc wants 45-60 min walks daily. my current pair pinches a toe (went black/blue near the nail). i suspect the front tapers too much and the wide pair i tried was heavy + kinda bites the top. so… time to actually buy something decent. questions: \- are diabetic shoes worth it, or should i just focus on fit (extra depth, real wide toe box, lighter weight, maybe rocker)? \- any tricks to tell if the toe box is truly wide before buying online? \- break-in tips so i dont wreck my toes again? Pair i am considering: \- hoka bondi \- new balance 1080/880 \- oliver cabell low 1 \- orthofeet \- propet anyone has experience with these, i would appreciate any recs or advices. thanks

3. u/Anthropogenic12 [score=2, created=2025-09-19T10:43:51]: I was issued some orthopaedic hiking boots by my orthotist. They've been an absolute game changer. I can walk for miles and miles without any problems.
4. u/smokinLobstah [score=1, created=2025-09-19T04:06:23]: My last job required a lot of standing/walking, and we had to wear black shoes/sneakers. I needed a new pair, so stopped into Walmart for something cheap and quick. I bought a pair of Sketchers Memory Foam sneaker/shoes for $29. The BEST footwear I've purchased in a long time...and plenty of toe-room. Go give them a try before spending $100s...

The problem is that you can never be certain if manufacturers or sales people are being honest when they describe a product as "diabetic". 20 years ago I went to a shop selling shoes for sports people. As well as carefully measuring my feet they had a a computerised gait testing system. I found I needed 4E width and flexible shoes. Eventually I found the best fit for me are New Balance 624 series. They have been my primary footwear ever since. Later I developed Plantar Fasciitis. I saw my podiatrist. He took a cast of my feet and arranged manufacture of specific orthotics to correct my stance. They corrected the problem within a couple of months.

7. u/110Baud [score=2, created=2025-09-18T13:09:02]: I have neuropathy and have to be very careful with my feet. I wore New Balance walking shoes for a few years and they were pretty good, but a couple years ago I switched to [Keen hiking shoes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YL34K1P) and love them. Good hiking shoes are designed for walking long distances without rubbing or blisters, with thick protective stable soles and super traction to avoid slips. Keens are known for their large toe box and these have been great, but you can get extra wide and/or move up a half size for more room, maybe with extra thick hiking socks for more padding.
8. u/TheFeshy [score=2, created=2025-09-18T12:52:16]: Walking is *so* helpful for managing glucose. Long ago I got myself those crazy "toe shoes", and have been wearing them regularly for this. They might look crazy, but you'll never have squished toes! They also fixed my knee problems. After very long walks (like a day at the theme park) my knees would hurt for days. Now my feet get sore instead, but it only lasts a day or less. Muscle pain vs joint pain, basically. After a year of wearing them though none of my old shoes fit. Too narrow now that my toes are in a more natural position, and my foot arch improved so much I changed size. Jogging basically meant starting from scratch, but walking wasn't a problem beyond the psychological feeling of walking into a store in what feels like bare feet. I get that not everyone can stomach the idea of shoes with individual toes.
9. u/Sayoayo [score=1, created=2025-09-18T11:59:38]: So i was diagnosed in July and had a trip planned already. I was super concerned because there would be a lot of walking involved and i was feeling overwhelmed with quality vs cost vs comfort vs style. I ended up with [these on Amazon](https://a.co/d/ieeg6qw) and i was super happy with them. For context I went to Iceland in August and we did a lot of walking, not hiking. I would recommend those shoes or something similar for what you're describing.
10. u/mythicaliz [score=1, created=2025-09-18T11:45:19]: I got winter boots from fitville on Amazon and they are SOOOOOOO much better. I have super wide feet with a high arch so shoes are almost impossible for me
11. u/Adept-Driver8576 [score=5, created=2025-09-18T11:09:10]: I have Hokas (Bondi &amp; Clifton) shoes and they've made walking much more comfortable and easier. I would recommend you try them on in a store to see if they work for you.
12. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-09-18T11:03:02]: I would buy a good pair of shoes. I was using WM shoes (not a good idea) for the longest time. My boys got together and bought me Hoka's and they are absolutely AMAZING! It literally feels like I'm walking on air. I can easily complete 10km - 15km without any foot pain as there is so much padding in them. I know others have had challenges with Hoka, but I can't complain. I've had them for a year and put on about 100km per month on them and they are still in good condition. They bought me another pair, but the 1st pair is still in great condition. They got me the Hoka Cliftons (waterproof version) as we live in the Vancouver and winters here get pretty wet.
13. u/ArsePucker [score=4, created=2025-09-18T10:19:11]: I’ve actually not heard of Diabetic shoes.. But as someone who’s on their feet 12hrs a day and T2, just get a decent pair of walking / or work shoes. Running shoes likely work too. Fit is important. I went to wide fit for everything a few years ago.. it’s a beautiful thing. Your feet are important, get shoes that fit correctly. Go get them measured if your unsure of what fit to get. Life’s better with happy feet! 🦶 🦶
14. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=5, created=2025-09-18T10:13:20]: Foot care nurse here. Do you have neuropathy? Circulation issues? Edema? If you have any of those then yes you need to get diabetic shoes. You need to be properly fitted and may need inserts. I say this because your toe turning blue from pressure and you not noticing it makes me believe you didn't feel it. If you did feel it, then wake up and take better care of your feet.
15. u/Me_Krally [score=2, created=2025-09-18T10:13:16]: I never tried diabetic shoes, but the key has always been a size larger and wider fit. The downside to this is if you do physical activities sometimes you don’t get good footing because when you exert force down your foot won’t have the support of the shoe in the areas where it’s longer and wider. The Hoka’s are nice but they do give you a feeling of being elevated due to the padding. The NB are pretty good as well, being light weight is great.
16. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=3, created=2025-09-18T09:53:16]: My go-to now is slip-on Skechers. Very comfy, wide enough but not too wide, stretchy so they hug without pinching.
