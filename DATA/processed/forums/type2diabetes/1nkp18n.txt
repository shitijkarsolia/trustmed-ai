===============================================================================

Hi everybody. I’m a 28M, I weight 187.4 pounds. I don’t want to get you bored with a very long post, but I’m just looking for some lighting. Three months ago my Hb1AC was 6.3. then I started to exercise more, to change my habits. I even lost 38 pounds (17 kilos). The last week I got exams, and I got happy because of the encouraging results. Some days ago before my exams I got a glucometer, just because I tought it was a good idea (it’s one of those that you need to pinch your finger to get a blood test). But actually it just has made me feel worse, because I see very high numbers, so I don’t know what to think now. I’m on a keto diet, I’ve had some cheat meals of course, but this last week I’ve been eating healthy and today my glucose even passed 200. Yesterday the highest it went in the whole day was 120, even 2hrs after eating! One day I even tried some tacos and the next morning it wasn’t that bad. It’s something that never ever happened to me before. Today, before I ate dinner, even with 7 hours of fasting, it was in 191. I don’t have symptoms like going to pee a lot, thirst, blurry vision, nothing like that. Please tell me if someone has gone through something similar, I know each body is different and we don’t work the same way, but I’d appreciate any piece of comment. I haven’t gone to a doctor in this period of time because I tought I only needed to change my habits but now I don’t know what to think :(

And ask your doctor if they can refer you to a diabetes education program. Often, insurance will pay for that, because they’d rather you learn and take care of yourself than have uncontrolled diabetes that leads to costly health problems.
2. u/alan_s [score=1, created=2025-09-18T17:36:12]: As you are only 28 I suggest you ask your doctor for further testing to be certain you are not one of the variants such as type 1, LADA or MODY. As u/ephcee implied, timing matters: [When To Test](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/11/when-to-test-one-hour-or-two-hour.html)
