===============================================================================

I deal with diabetic feet all day and would like to share some knowledge about caring for your feet. Do not soak your feet in hot water. Use warm and test the temp with your wrist. Hot water dries out your skin which can cause cracks in your skin. Possibly leading to infection. Possibly leading to loss of a toe or worse. Callouses are a huge no for diabetics. Calluses are usually from friction or pressure. You want to avoid calluses which can hide an ulcer under it. They develop to protect your tissues. If you don't keep them under control and the friction or pressure continues, the tissue under the callus is rubbing between the callus and bone. I've worked on what appeared to be an ordinary callus and found an ulcer under it. When you have diabetes, it takes months to heal that ulcer. Months of risking an infection. That means a special dressing, which you will have to change yourself or go to a wound care specialist once or twice a week to change the dressing. Or maybe a wound vac or oxygen therapy. It's not fun. You can't put weight on it, so plan on wearing a special boot or using a knee scooter for months. Fungus. Athletes foot is very common with diabetics. As soon as you notice it, see your doctor. OTC meds aren't particularly effective for diabetics. That fungus can go to your toenails and that is very, very difficult to get rid of, if you can. Look up diabetic fungal nails. Put lotion on your feet every day, but not between your toes. Lotion between toes can cause fungus or maceration. Maceration is open skin, que risk of infection. Go on the internet and do research, look at pictures.

I am not a fan of the wound care NP they’ve given us, but I’ve heard only good things so I’m trying to ignore my personal issues with her. When they first took him off the wound vac, she was like, here, we’re taking it off, come back in 4 days, you can suddenly go to full weight bearing, etc. Of course, there was excessive drainage, macerationq, and hypergranulation and they had to put it back on the next week. A few weeks later, we’re back to removing the vac (this time it’s staying off). But she drops out of the blue today that he can’t ever not wear shoes again, full shoes, not even slippers with cushy feet and hard soles at home, and even to get up to use the bathroom at night he needs to put his surgery boot on and once he’s in shoes, put the real shoes on… the toilet is about 13 clean, clear feet from his side of the bed) Only ever have it off in the shower. Well wait, he’s been weight bearing at least partially for like 5 weeks now and you’re just telling us this today? So after being free one week without the vac, and hypergranulation, he’s full weight, I change the dressing every few days for the next 2 weeks, no washing it, I had to practically beg to be able to put something on it to help the moisture (she said betadine on the edges “if you really feel you have to”). The substitute nurse and I had a talk about how awesome MediHoney is, and how great it is preventing hypergranulation (I used it for a wound years ago), and when I asked if it was a possibility for hubby, this NP laughed and was like, “oh that so old school” then talked about getting a skin graft approved (no evidence yet he’ll need one). So there’s my rambling, but do you have any thoughts? I’d love to change, but she’s pretty much the only wound care midlevel in the office, and we don’t want to leave this particular podiatrist. I just feel like we’re really not getting top care (and I swear she’s doing the “she’s to the bathroom” just as a dig bc she saw how it kinda shocked and irritated me that she hadn’t said anything, so she doubled down… And if by some chance this is her… talk the other NP into taking us please and stop punishing my husband bc I told you I’d prefer MD and DO to midlevels for major care?

3. u/Fancy_Leshy [score=1, created=2025-09-21T10:35:48]: Question if that's ok: I recently got an injury that resulted in a few bone chips in my foot. I was in a cast, then a boot, and now I am in a light duty brace that fits in a shoe for walking in. I have a follow up in a few weeks, but should I be keeping an eye out for certain red flags? As far as I understand, bone chips are treated naturally by the body by creating a callous around them. Also, in regards to callouses in general, I have one or two in placed I have had come and go pretty much my whole life (side of ball of foot, side of pinky toe knuckle) and just have seemed very normal. How do I treat/remove callouses like that?
4. u/Xilanxiv [score=1, created=2025-09-21T00:33:02]: Can the toe fungus lead to issues in and of itself? I've had it on my big left toe for years, but I've avoided getting the pill or cream to treat it because I know anti-fungals can make bacterial infections worse or more likely. I do see my endo every 3 months and he checks my feet and has never been worried about that nail though.
5. u/Cast1736 [score=2, created=2025-09-20T22:57:52]: I have tried to keep the calluses off my feet but with my job, I swear I need them. Smooth skin on my feet and my next shift i ended up with blisters that night from being in work boots and turnout boots all day on calls. For now I try and tow the line of not completely smooth skin and not letting the feet look like a dried up prehistoric riverbed.
6. u/AntGroundbreaking102 [score=3, created=2025-09-20T14:11:58]: i’ve never even knew diabetics are supposed to go to foot doctors until i joined reddit. my mom has been diabetic for over 30 years (started off as gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with my brother and turned type 2 sometime after it) and she never knew either and has never been to one. she cuts her own toe nails. in eight years since i was diagnosed, my doctor mentioned it once and said as long as my feet are okay, it’s fine for now. and my pedicures are okay, which is good bc i only trust certain people with my feet. i also tend to get calluses on my feet bc i walk around barefoot and without socks whenever im home
7. u/mariemrm [score=3, created=2025-09-20T12:34:54]: Thank you for your informative post. Everything you said is so important. If there is one thing I would say about diabetic foot care it is to check your feet often, every day if possible. Things can go downhill fast and getting problems under control usually requires enormous effort with frequent doctor visits and treatments. I developed a pressure ulcer under a callus on the ball of my foot. I thought I was keeping the callus in check with gentle use of an emery board and lotion. On the surface everything appeared fine but I started getting pain under the callus. I used insoles that had more cushioning and that helped for a couple months. Suddenly the whole ball of my foot was red and swelling. I set up an appointment with a podiatrist but by the time I got there, 3 days later, the ulcer had broken through the callus and was oozing very nasty stuff. It was infected and spreading. 8 months of wound care treatments followed. There were infection treatments, debridement and other wound therapies, wound dressing offloading, or deflecting pressure away from the wound, shoe adaptations, an orthopedic walker and physio therapy. And lots more I can’t remember. I now know that if I had gone to the doctor when the pain started I probably could have avoided the worst of it. So pay attention to your feet, a little neglect can erupt into major issues.
8. u/sharpecads [score=1, created=2025-09-20T12:22:30]: When you talk about athletes foot I don’t get this but I do get jock itch a fair bit. Do I need to take any other precautions other than the anti fungal stuff I currently use?
9. u/gertymoon [score=1, created=2025-09-20T11:55:51]: Is there a particular lotion to use for your feet or is something like O'keefs feet cream adequate?

11. u/dafrog84 [score=3, created=2025-09-20T06:16:29]: I've been to my diabetic doctor(s) many times, none of them have said anything about my big toes, each of which has fungus under the toenails (about a quarter). It's never gotten any worse than it is now, but I broke both my feet about 12 years ago and when the casts came off my big toes on each foot had it. Good Lord. PS thanks for your post, and yes I went and googled the pictures. So I'm ordering what I need to take care of it.
12. u/Mimi-The-Minx [score=3, created=2025-09-20T05:48:56]: I went on a Diabetic awareness course yesterday &amp; got told this information bc I've not had my feet checked yet since being diagnosed in March this yr. Not pleasant was also told never to walk around barefoot even indoors bc you can not always feel that you have hurt the bottom of your foot . So I should go to my Doctors as I swear I have that problem in my toenails had it before I was diagnosed. I wash my feet everyday not hot water I can't tolerate hot water I make sure I have no callouses but think 1 is developing on 1 of my big toes I moisturise, but have never put it between my toes .. I care about my feet even though I don't like them
