Hi. It's me again. So. I keep forgetting to ask my doctor this. But, if you don't have your gallbladder, do you think it affects your numbers? I had mine taken out about 12 years ago. Diagnosed t2 in December of last year and even though I have changed to a really strict diet and am exercising my sugars are still in the low 200's. They were in the high 500's when I was diagnosed. I get my A1C checked in a couple of weeks so hopefully that is lower than 10. I was just wondering if maybe not having that second digestive organ is affecting me.
