===============================================================================

A T2D friend of mine has been experiencing cramps while exercising recently and was wondering if this is a common symptom, but we can’t find any information online. It seems like cramps while immobile (like lying down at night) are quite common, but there’s not much on cramps while exercising. What are you all’s experiences? Would really help my friend to know if what they’re going through is common or not…

Low B12 can lead to cramping at night and in general.

Now I use sugar free hydration tablets in water after any cardio beyond 45 minutes, or if I've sweated a lot. Keeps the cramps at bay

I was able to walk it off and when I got home I drank more water, which helped. I used to also get those bad night cramps, where your leg feels like it's seizing up and read that it could be due to low potassium so starting having bananas more regularly and they seem to have subsided.
