===============================================================================

At what point do type 2s use insulin? I am trying to get insurance approval for ozempic and the new company is asking why I never tried insulin...? I had no clue insulin would even be considered at a1c lower than 7 for type 2.

After many years of use, we have discovered and learned a great deal, often about what the medical and insurance don't disclose. I keep this short and say how I am successfully treating my T2 (test as non-diabetic) after many years of using or trying about every drug and other options. Stopped all pills because of their side effects. I use inhaled insulin (Afrezza) as my primary bolus because it's by far the fastest-acting and also out of my system in 1.5 hours. Also, it doesn't cause weight gain like regular insulin. I found that no other insulin treatments can deliver these benefits. For stability, I use 10mg of Mounjaro and the basal insulin Awiqli (a weekly single injection). The benefits are use very few shots and then only weekly. Easier to travel and fewer operational problems. When I switched from Lebre and Dexcom's to the Eversense 365 CGM (which lasts for one year and eliminates the weekly CGM problems and operational issues), As a result, I simplified and significantly improved my diabetes treatment, and my out-of-pocket costs actually decreased substantially.

Once my A1C was normal, insurance wouldn't cover it. As if my diagnosis would change 🤣 I'm now on the compound version mainly for maintaining my weight but I still get pretty big spikes so I'm thinking insulin might be the way.

It’s certainly doable for most people, but for me, insulin was an absolute game changer. I didn’t realize how much much body was reacting specifically to things that insulin can help with until I had access to it. Long acting insulin especially has helped me immensely. Yes, it’s a once a day injection, which can be rough for some people, but it lasts for roughly 12 hours and has helped me be able to moderate things so much more easily. If numbers help, before I was using any insulin, my A1C was coming in at around the mid 7s, and that was back when I was working out at least 45 minutes a day for about 4 days a week and heavily moderating my sugar and carb intake. I was still taking the other meds I described above. Once I started using insulin (and got access to a CGM), it went down considerably. My last A1C was 5.1.

5. u/slitherkime [score=2, created=2025-09-23T06:40:27]: I love insulin. Go to Walmart and get Novolin R in pen form. This costs me $45 for 4 pens. It works for me and I hope it works for you.
6. u/MetalBrat098890 [score=4, created=2025-09-22T18:44:12]: I was on insulin for 7 years as well as metformin my A1C ten years ago was 9.8…?, the insulin became less effective so I have been on ozempic for three years, I lost 35 pounds and my a1C is 5.3 now. Whew 😅 being a diabetic is complicated. The insurance companies are gonna wanna see you tried something before they give you the ozempic I would assume. Now a days you would think with the success stories they would just give it to you based on your type 2 diagnosis. I live by the ozempic. I really don’t think I would be in this good of shape without it. Keep fighting for it.

9. u/pinkfong5678 [score=4, created=2025-09-22T10:15:27]: I was recommended to begin insulin when my A1c was not budging even when I was taking the prescribed pills at max dose. Started on long acting insulin only then added in regular insulin when needed. I’ve been working with my medical team on adjusting doses for 2 years and am only now being offered a glp-1 to help lower my A1c to below a 7%.
10. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=5, created=2025-09-22T09:56:28]: For me it was when the drugs/pills were no longer working My A1C was not dropping and my daily average was always 10 mmol/l or higher. As soon as I was put on insulin (two types - fast acting, taken before meals and short acting taken at night before I sleep) my numbers stabilized. I'd ask your doctor about insulin - I don't trust insurance companies to question treatment decisions. But it would be odd to ask about (or suggest) insulin if your A1C is within an "acceptable" range.
