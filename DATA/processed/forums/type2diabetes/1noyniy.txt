Personally, I also don’t like the fact that it contains so many other ingredients other than konjac. These days, when I want pasta, I do half a serving of Only Bean pasta. I like both the black bean ones and edamame ones. Neither spike me.
4. u/Zeus783 [score=2, created=2025-09-25T01:44:06]: This kind of product made me go off pasta altogether.. So that's that. Beside being bland the slimy texture just killed the idea of having pasta again..
5. u/TheFeshy [score=1, created=2025-09-24T15:29:40]: I eat them pretty frequently. The Konjac works well with very flavorful and thick sauces, but not in other contexts. The texture isn't very noodle-like, and the taste mostly isn't there at all, unlike pasta. But I just had chicken alfredo made with them tonight, and it's something I got used to. If you absolutely love pasta, they aren't going to cut it. If you love alfredo sauce and need something that you can put it on, it'll suffice. I personally like spaghetti sauce thick enough to eat with a fork, so I use them for that too.
6. u/Me_Krally [score=2, created=2025-09-24T07:45:53]: They’re not bad, but definitely not pasta like.
7. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=6, created=2025-09-23T20:50:59]: Konjac noodles are really good replacements for rice noodles, like when you'd have pad thai or throwing it into a pho. I agree with atsu333 though that they're definitely not for Italian pasta style recipes though.

9. u/atsu333 [score=6, created=2025-09-23T18:30:27]: Not that brand, but the same kind of product. I honestly don't remember what it did to my readings, except it wasn't a massive spike. I do remember that it had a mild flavor to it that wasn't great, and the texture was straight up bad. It can work for like an udon or glass noodle maybe, but it just doesn't work with italian style dishes.
