===============================================================================

I've been using 3/10mL syringes. I ran out and went and bought another box. Didn't notice until I got home that they were 1/2mL syringes. Does it make any difference in the dosage? I mean if I'm taking 25 units of insulin would it be the same with both needles?

As long as you’re able to figure out the difference in what you need to draw up into the actual syringe, you should be fine.
