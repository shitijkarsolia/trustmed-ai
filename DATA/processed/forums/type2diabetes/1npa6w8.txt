===============================================================================

Please can anyone give me your stories of encouragement. I have R1M1 but my sight is getting worse. I always see clouds and black shadows and dark spots and blind spots. I am so scared I am going to go blind. I have reduced my blood sugars very quickly and now read this is not good. Do the eyes get used to it after some time ? I went for a oct at spec savers recently as it scared me how many floaters I suddenly had but they said my floaters are normal. My vision is giving me a headache now. I’m going to be seen by the Moorfields on 4th Oct. Can people give me your personal views. What can I do to help me! I’ve started using Noctura 400 past 2 months but my eye vision has got worse :(

Be aware that opticians and optometrists are not ophthalmologists; the difference is important: [The Three Types of Eye Doctors: Optometrist, Ophthalmologist, &amp; Optician](https://www.aucmed.edu/blog/the-three-types-of-eye-doctors)

My vision is alright now, but only because I went to a specialist and had work done. Mitigating your blood sugar can help prevent damage from occurring or worsening, but dont count on it undoing damage thats already been done.

I went undiagnosed for 12 years and started having vision issues which lead to my diagnosis. My A1C was 12.3 at diagnoses and it’s been 5.5 to 6.7 over the last 10 years. I’m currently 45 years old. I had tiny blind spots and that blocked out areas of my vision and I had distortion and blurriness. I started out receiving injections in both my eyes. Eylea was injected directly into my eye to stop the swelling. I also had three laser surgery’s to cauterize the small tears/bulging vessels in my retinas that caused the swelling. This was about 8 years ago and my retinal doctor said I would eventually lose my sight. However, and this is important, You HAVE to keep your sugar under control and A1C in non or pre diabetic levels. My left eye became stable after 4 years of laser surgery’s and injections. It is still stable. My right eye did not respond to Eylea and I started getting Ozurdex steroid capsules injected in my right eye and I continued with laser surgery’s periodically. The steroid causes cataracts as it slowly clouds and deteriorates your lens. This side effect eventually lead to getting my lenses replaced. The drug can also cause eye pressure to spike and that can cause glaucoma. Pressure needs to be monitored. After 5 years of Ozurdex injections I had leftover capsule shells floating in my retina. Those were all recently removed. 12 years later: - Been on Invokana for 11 years - My left eye is still stable. - My vision is now 20/15 thanks to my cataract surgery. (I do need reading glasses) - My right eye is still swelling but it is managed with a topical steroid patch put directly on the back of my eye (no longer getting injections) - I’m happy and healthy and no longer afraid of losing my eyesight. What to do. - See a retinal specialist immediately. - Manage your A1C at all costs. - Exercise. - Cut out 95% of all refined sugar. - Low carb high protein diet. - Don’t panic. Be proactive and monitor.

So, please feel encouraged for yourself too. There are lots of treatments to prevent total vision loss. Relax . Blood Glucose level control is the key . Please do not feel panicked or despondent. The vision in my right eye is affected, but I feel okay. Just to make you understand, I just came back from a 5 km walk and I am 50+ years of age. You too can be okay, as long as you keep your Blood Glucose levels within range . ( FYI : Am not a Medical Doctor) I live in a small town in South India . There were a lot of treatments available (at a very nominal cost ) to me even here. Docs gave me Laser Treatment to seal all the damaged blood vessels in the retina. The next line of treatment was the anti- VEGF injections to the eye. It is not as dangerous as it sounds. It is meant to slow the decline or stop the decline in vision. Anti- VEGF injections seem to have done the job .Vision in my Right Eye has not declined since 2015. I am sure you have such treatments where you live too. I feel okay since 2015 and lead a very active life . Hope this encourages you . High Blood Glucose levels during my COVID hospitalization in 2021 also did not affect or worsen my Macular Edema either. You too will be okay. I feel that keeping your Blood Glucose levels within range is ultra important . To keep your blood sugar levels within range meds are important, but an active lifestyle and a protein based , low carb diet is ultra important. FYI : I am Type 2 Diabetic . My a1C is below 7.2% . I do not have to take Insulin , I have been prescribed oral meds only. Good Luck to you . Modern meds and a good lifestyle will keep your eyes safe . There are trials of STEM Cell treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy going on in Canada . See if they need volunteers or just follow the research periodically.

So you are definitely going to the right place (you’ll be seeing people who deal with stuff like this day in day out) and you don’t have long to wait. Try to stay off Dr Google if you can. I know it’s hard but it probably won’t help. Reach out here if you need some support.
6. u/JEngErik [score=2, created=2025-09-24T05:44:59]: The reason for sudden onset blurriness/vision changes is that the lenses in the eyes do not easily move glucose through the membrane creating an osmotic pressure gradient from the falling glucose outside the lens, causing the lenes to distort, resulting in temporary changes to vision. As the glucose stabilizes and the lenses reach equilibrium with the surrounding fluid, the lenses return to their normal shape. This is not the same as the recent hysteria over NAION which is also caused by rapid changes to glucose and totally unrelated to GLP-1RAs themselves. Dr Google AI might make mention of this, so I wanted to be sure you had the scientific basis before self diagnosing (always consult a physician familiar with _your_ medical history). The point is ... Keep glucose under control and all should improve with time.
