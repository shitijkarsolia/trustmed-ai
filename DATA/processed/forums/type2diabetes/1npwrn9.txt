===============================================================================

Hi all, I know this wont apply to everyone here but i'm trying to get mounjaro on the pbs for severe insulin resistance and I need more people to sign and share my petition. I live with severe insulin resistance—my insulin levels are over 970 (when “severe” is usually 200–300). Standard treatments don’t work, and the only medication that helps, tirzepatide (Mounjaro), isn’t on the PBS for insulin resistance.This leaves me and many others facing impossible costs just to stay healthy. No one should have to choose between essential treatment and basic living expenses. Please sign and share the petition to get tirzepatide listed on the PBS for severe insulin resistance. Together, we can push for change.
