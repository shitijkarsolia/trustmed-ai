===============================================================================

Altered my diet immediately and my glucose is ranging from 118-128. Dr said I only need to test once a day and this is a 12 day span. I test at different times, after sleep, snack, and meal. Weight and BP is very good and stable. My question- is the variance above good or do I need to knock it down more? Thanks for your help

I wrote these to help you use your meter or CGM systematically: * [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) * [When To Test](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/11/when-to-test-one-hour-or-two-hour.html)

Some suggest that huge swings with a “good” average are more damaging than a somewhat high number. A strict endo I like says 83 is the perfect blood sugar number; but that is contrary to many endos that are afraid that is too low. I check once daily, mostly before breakfast; but occasionally check 2 hours after meals as well and at 3 a.m. as I experience dawn phenomenon.

If that’s after a meal, then that’s great! My goals for myself (NOT saying this is what others should necessarily strive for) are &lt;100 fasted and &lt;140 after eating.
