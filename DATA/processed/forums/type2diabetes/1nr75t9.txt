Is their any good soap for diabetics? I'm a type 2? Using a stelo cgm to monitor it any advice on a good body soap that I can use that won't harm my body or the sensor would be greatly appreciated I tend to usually only shower between cgm or after when dies I usually shower then wait a few mins before put a new one and then don't shower until it does so I don't mess up the sensor but idk I feel like I need to start showering more often then every two weeks so need some good body soap advice 😀

I use a little patch with a hole in the center for my sensor from expression meds and sometimes have to replace that halfway through but have not had a sensor fall off yet. Actually, I find them pretty hard to get off after the 15 days lol Please just shower and use whatever soap, your sensor will be fine

5. u/tiathepanacea [score=13, created=2025-09-26T15:17:31]: You shower once in every two weeks...? Come on, use regular soap and shower regularly. Don't make a bigger deal out of this than it really is. Your body and sensor are both gonna be fine with whatever soap you use.

7. u/inertSpark [score=10, created=2025-09-26T12:23:37]: Well, just soap. Nothing special. Just soap.
8. u/zoptix [score=8, created=2025-09-26T12:09:36]: I've been using the Stelo for over a year. I've not changed anything about my showering habits. The Stelo needs no protection.
9. u/TheDailyDizzy [score=13, created=2025-09-26T11:47:58]: Why wouldn't you shower? Shower every day and use whatever soap you want. That's gross and weird!
10. u/SnorlaxIsCuddly [score=4, created=2025-09-26T11:45:03]: Put a cover over the sensor. A cover also prevents it catching on something and/of falling off your body
11. u/SquirrelBun [score=4, created=2025-09-26T11:18:52]: You can shower with the Stelo, no problem, don't go for two weeks without showering! I shower every day with mine and have had zero issues regardless of water temp, how long I'm in there for or what kind of soap I use.
