I know right now it feels like the world is coming down, crushing you. Lean on this community and read these posts. They helped me, and I can tell you that your outlook will become positive soon. Wishing you all the best.

If you’re feeling like you don’t know where to start I would recommend just starting with one thing and building from there. If you’re not active, become more active. Different people have different experiences but for me my activity level makes a massive difference in my blood glucose level, sometimes seemingly more than what I eat. If I ever plan to eat something “bad” I do it before going hiking lol. If you’re already active, work on the dietary side of things, starting with the easiest to cut out. Alcohol is good to remove first since it’s pointless calories and can cause problems for diabetics AND for people on metformin. And just be nice to yourself, because it’s a thing you’re going to have to manage long-term. I find this subreddit pretty helpful to browse when I have questions because we’ve all had pretty much the same questions at different times.
3. u/Cereal_Killer147 [score=3, created=2025-09-27T09:46:28]: I cried, A LOT. I freaked out and decided I’m not taking meds and I’m going to change everything because what I’m doing is NOT working. I think for most people, it’s a shock but in reality, it’s not. I’m obese, I’m eating carbs and ice cream and I don’t exercise. I had a lot happen to me to get to this point so I by no means am beating up on myself or others but it’s a shock in the sense that I was gonna get ahead of this and I didn’t. So you do as much research as possible. I started walking every day and I cut out as much sugar as possible. No carbs, high fiber, high fat, high protein. I think almost all of us do this but what’s important is can you be consistent and continue with that or is it not sustainable and you fall back. That is why I chose NO meds. In a month my blood sugar went from 357 (not fasting) to 150. I think once the shock wares off and you decide what to do you will have more clarity and the depression and anxiety will subside. I’m 2 months in and I am focusing on me. I’m 47 with a 21 year old daughter and it’s always about my husband and daughter. I’m putting myself first. It’s not the end of the world, I promise you. It’s the beginning of a new you.
4. u/Emergency-Hippo2797 [score=2, created=2025-09-27T07:35:50]: I just got diagnosed two weeks ago, A1C of 7.1. My GP never once mentioned drugs, I’m going strictly by diet, fasting and exercise. Also no refined sugar, processed foods, or starchy veggies. I’m over 60, so 30 years old seems pretty young to me not to have been given a diet option.
5. u/oldhippie73 [score=5, created=2025-09-27T03:25:24]: My Mother died from diabetes related illness after suffering with it for many years. She died at 75 yrs. So when I was told I had it, I felt like my whole world had fallen apart around me. Shocked, depressed, anxious, miserable. Until I did what you are doing now. I reached out to diabetes groups and got good information. I studied diabetes. I bought cookbooks for good meal planning. I did my best to get healthier by exercising (mostly walking) and losing some weight. I still cheat occasionally with treats, but all in all I feel great. I measure my blood glucose at home and see the Dr every 3 months for lab work. My A1c stays pretty steady at 5.1 to 5.5. I am 70 as of July. Hang in there. Do what you KNOW you're supposed to do and you may have another 30 or 40 years left in you.
6. u/catsandplants424 [score=5, created=2025-09-26T16:59:29]: You will be fine if you make the changes you spoke about. I got diagnosed in 2020 then found out I had cancer in late 2023. I survived both so far so I know you can do this. 50ish female.
7. u/MeasurementSame9553 [score=5, created=2025-09-26T16:49:26]: For a lot of us the diagnosis turns into developing a plan and getting to the healthiest we have been in years. Progress is compounding. Make small healthy changes everyday with food and exercise. You got this and we are all here to support you.
8. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=3, created=2025-09-26T14:39:01]: Ask your doctor to order you a continuous glucose monitor. The majority of us use them and they are immensely useful. You get realtime feedback on what you're eating and how it affects your glucose levels. Most insurance companies have figured out how useful they are in prevention and they are approved far more routinely now. Take some deep breaths. You will understand all of this in time.
9. u/ArkieRN [score=3, created=2025-09-26T14:31:50]: Not drinking alcohol is best but if you’re going to imbibe then pure spirits are better. (Rum, vodka, tequila, whiskey, etc) Putting it in a no or low carb mixer is best. A good choice is Sprite Zero and rum. If you prefer cola then Diet Coke/Diet Dr Pepper and rum. Or Diet 7&amp;7 (Zero sugar Seven Up and Segram’s 7 whiskey).
10. u/edtank1103 [score=0, created=2025-09-26T14:27:29]: Try the carnivore diet. Look up Dr. Ken Berry on YouTube. He explains the diet. Try it for 90 days and see where your sugar stands ithen.
11. u/Cultural-Custard-968 [score=3, created=2025-09-26T13:40:11]: First of all - YOU HAVE GOT THIS! Life must change, but it is FAR from over! Use as much technology and research as possible to understand what is happening to you. Your journey will be different to everyone else's. Get a monitor, get some nutrition scales, get things to make you feel better :) Ask questions. Never feel like a question is stupid or not worth asking. It is important that you are seen and heard. A good step joining this subreddit - everyone here is critically minded and so supportive. Google the crap out of dietary alternatives. If you like something, find a way to have it. DIABETES WILL NOT STOP ME EATING PIZZA! YOU WILL FIND A WAY! Know you will fail - and that's ok! That's how we figure out what we can and can't have. How we keep moving forward with purpose. Do not feel shame! What is happening to you is not worthy of shame. It is worthy of action. Please carry the immortal words of Gandalf the Grey (and Tolkien) with you. "I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo. "So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."
12. u/mereshadow1 [score=5, created=2025-09-26T12:57:25]: I was diagnosed in 1987 in my mid thirties and could have written your post. This was before the A1c test was generally used. My BS was over 400, high blood pressure, high cholesterol - the whole works which isn’t uncommon in newly diagnosed diabetics. Now I have blood tests done every 6 months. I’m taking various medications and now use insulin but my blood tests have been normal for years, including my A1c. My last test was 5.5. It’s a big change in your life, but if you don’t make some changes, it gets very ugly. But if you read through this Reddit, you will see a lot of success stories. Highly processed foods and preservatives are not your friend. Hang in there!!

14. u/Artsi93 [score=3, created=2025-09-26T12:20:25]: Its new chapter of life now. How about alcohol, nicotine and foods like potatoes, rice and pasta? Sausages? I dont know whats most easiest and healthiest snack or food what to make, feels like all yogorts and salads are in use currently. Also had high trigly ldl 2.0 and they couldnt measure hdl.
