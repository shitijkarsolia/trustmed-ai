===============================================================================

Hey folks, I’m APOE4 x 2 (lucky me). My fasting glucose is elevated…not quite type 2 but hovering in pre-diabetes. I’ve lost about 10 pounds in the last two months (I’m still overweight but not obese), and barely touch sugar or refined carbs. I’ve read the Diabetes Code and Glucose Revolution and follow their guidance, trying to eat a Mediterranean diet. And yet I can’t seem to get my fasting blood sugar to come down. Anyone else in this boat and have a success story (or not) to share? I feel like my APOE4 status is working against me in this fight.
