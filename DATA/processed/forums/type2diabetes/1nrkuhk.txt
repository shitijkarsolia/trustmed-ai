===============================================================================

Read Sheri Colberg's The Athlete's Guide to Diabetes (2019) which was good, but it's clearly really written for Type 1s with Type 2s as an afterthought. Are there any up to date books or other good evidence based resources on exercise and managing type 2 diabetes? I'm currently doing 20-30 minutes of walks a day, 5-10 minutes of dumbbell exercises and doing multiple blood glucose monitoring tests a day with an Accu-Check meter. Thanks in advance. P.S. Also thank u/alan_s for your blog, really helpful.
