===============================================================================

Hey ya'll, just wondered if anyone else has experienced this. I have been on Tresiba for at least 2 or 3 years now (so long I can't even remember). I was initially prescribed 70 or 80 units &amp; went up to 100 to attempt better numbers &amp; have been on that amount forever. I inject at night before bed. I have always taken a shower, injected, got in bed, read for a while, watch tv or whatever &amp; go to sleep. Most of this time I did not wear a CGM &amp; did not test my BG frequently. I saw a new endo a few weeks ago &amp; started Lispro for the 1st time. My overall sugar is coming down. She never said to reduce the amount of Tresiba. So one night, I inject, and about 15 or 20 minutes later, my Freestyle Libre 3+ reader alarm starts going off. It said my blood sugar was down to 56! What the what?!!? How? And why? From Tresiba?!!? By the time I got downstairs to try &amp; find sugar I was about to pass out &amp; had to yell for my mom to come &amp; help. The next night, I injected my Tresiba as usual (just like I had for months &amp; months), but this time, I had my CGM reader sitting right beside me &amp; I watched the numbers tank yet again. Thankfully, they didnt drop quite as far, so I went to sleep, only to be woke up around 4am with the Low Alert &amp; blood sugar showing at 62. So I called my endo later that morning &amp; told her what was happening &amp; all she said was that since the rapid acting insulin was bringing my overall sugar down, that 100 units of Tresiba was now too much &amp; to reduce to 80. So that night I injected 80 and...guess what? Rapid drop again. It didnt go as low, but I am concerned that I watched it instantly plummet at least 25 to 50 or more points. Now I am absolutely terrified to inject. I didn't know that Tresiba (ultra-long lasting insulin) could do this?!!? And to have been injecting such a high dose for sooooo many years &amp; not ever had any problems &amp; now this? I even asked my doc if I maybe accidentally injected into a muscle or vein (because I had injected into my leg that 1st night) &amp; she said no, that wasn't a "thing" with ultra-long acting insulin. Is it possible that they'e packaged the wrong insulin into the Tresiba pen? That low really shook me up. It felt terrible &amp; has triggered such extreme anxiety that I cant inject the rapid-acting insulin anymore &amp; I have started over with the Tresiba in an attempt to titrate back up &amp; only injected 16 units tonight. This is terrifying 🥺
