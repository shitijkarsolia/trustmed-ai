===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with type 2 almost a year ago. I tried GLP-1 but I can’t afford it and my insurance won’t cover it. I just started metformin 500mg just once a day. The constant diarrhea and nausea is a lot worse than I expected. I’m only taking one pill a day!! My glucose numbers are pre diabetic when fasting and normal levels after eating and we are waiting for my A1C to come back. Should I get a second opinion? Any advice on handling such I low dose of metformin? I was drinking heavily when I was first diagnosed. I also had gestational diabetes with both of my kids. Edit: I am overweight and my dr wants me to lose weight in order to lower my glucose levels overall and I understand that.

After many years of use, we have discovered and learned a great deal, often about what the medical and insurance companies don't disclose. Unfortunately, insurance coverage often dictates the treatment and care options available to us. However, there are usually workarounds and ways to win. We just have to ask them, what they require for certain types of treatments, and then get our doctors to support the approval. I keep this short and say how I am successfully treating mine (test as non-diabetic) after many years of using or trying about every drug and other options, including getting insurance coverage. I could write a book about what worked and didn't. I stopped all pills because of their side effects. They all have them. Some are worse than others. I switched to insulin because it works, and that is our problem, it's easy availability, costs are affordable, and all insurance covers this treatment. I use inhaled insulin (Afrezza) as my primary bolus because it's by far the fastest-acting and also out of my system in 1.5 hours. Also, it doesn't cause weight gain like regular insulin. I found that no other insulin treatments can deliver these benefits. For stability, I use 10mg of Mounjaro and the basal insulin Awiqli (a weekly single injection). The benefits are I only need two injections weekly. Easier to travel and fewer operational problems. When I switched from Lebre and Dexcom's to the Eversense 365 CGM (which lasts for one year and eliminates the weekly CGM problems and operational issues), As a result, I simplified and significantly improved my diabetes treatment, and my out-of-pocket costs actually decreased substantially.

Also you shouldn’t really drink alcohol unless you want your diarrhea to be more painful… you also want to have whole meals like with veggies and protein otherwise sugary carb meals will make ur stomach hurt. Drink lots of water too. You will be okay, but it’s really tough adjusting at first. It’s not forever but if you eat consistently and drink fiber it will help your bowel movements. Never take it on an empty stomach unless you want the worst cramps of your life only take it like right after you’ve eaten.

4. u/hellgabeez [score=3, created=2025-09-28T17:29:00]: I'm in 2000 mg of the metformin extended release. I had tummy problems for a little while but it got better. Maybe it just takes time?
5. u/rohanedmonson [score=3, created=2025-09-28T06:49:14]: To lower your glucose spikes without taking metformin, you have to switch up your diet and activity level. A long walk after a meal will lower the glucose spike. Eating Fat, Fiber, and Protein with your carbs also keeps you from spiking too high. 1-2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar in a tall glass of water before a meal will also reduce your spikes. Use the Zero app to help you track your fasting times. Do a lot of research about the power of intermittent fasting.
6. u/oldhippie73 [score=2, created=2025-09-28T04:33:18]: While I was taking metformin the diarrhea was terrible. Made me a prisoner in my own home. A trial month of Rybelsus proved to be fantastic but that stuff is anywhere from $250 to $500 per month, even with insurance. I now get it for free through a program you can find on line. I probably can't post it since it will seem to be an advertisement. Hmu and Ill give you the info somehow.
7. u/alan_s [score=4, created=2025-09-27T16:13:29]: Discuss this ASAP with your doctor. Metformin is only an aid to an appropriate diet and exercise and there is no need for you to suffer the side effects which affect a minority of users. &gt;My glucose numbers are pre diabetic when fasting and normal levels after eating Define "normal numbers" please. Read this to see why I ask: [Blood Glucose Targets](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/blood-glucose-targets-2015.html) This might also help you improve your A1c without the metformin or other oral meds: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

9. u/Correct_Chocolate528 [score=2, created=2025-09-27T16:03:23]: I also have type 2 and was taking metformin like you and just got diagnosed with IBD and I seriously think it was the metformin
10. u/JEngErik [score=2, created=2025-09-27T15:49:31]: When you say GLP-1RAs aren't approved by your insurance, are they in your formulary and just got denied or not in your formulary at all? If it's the former, what was the reason for denial?
11. u/boiled_frog23 [score=3, created=2025-09-27T15:33:40]: Eating with food helps but avoiding all simple and complex carbs makes them easier to manage.
12. u/Few_Championship1798 [score=3, created=2025-09-27T15:13:29]: I found I have less gastric issues if I take my Metformin mid meal. Eat half, take your pill, eat the rest.
13. u/AlwaysFalling859 [score=3, created=2025-09-27T14:04:27]: I can’t tolerate Metformin, the shots-trulicity, Monjaro, or Ozympic, seems like there was one more. It caused me severe abdominal distress. Every time I put food in my mouth I was curled up in the fetal position in pain and with nausea, and diarrhea. The doctors and nutritionist said something like “well just try to power through the first two weeks and then it seems to get better for people.” It was like they were told to say this because they all used the same lingo. I told them after failing all those drugs to quit saying that crap. I’m a person who can’t tolerate that with out severe pain and being confined to a nearby toilet. This was before all the class action lawsuits came out and it was a known common problem. So I say all this to say if you aren’t tolerating something, don’t let them bully you into taking it for two weeks, discuss with them now for a different alternative. I support you.

15. u/vape-o [score=3, created=2025-09-27T10:52:39]: I take psyllium husk daily mid afternoon (works after work for me) and I don’t have the diarrhea anymore. I take metformin 1000 mg twice a day.
