===============================================================================

My father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last year (and was borderline for years) and i'm really conflicted on how to help him lose weight. He is on weight-loss medication, workouts his arms everyday (from what he told me), doesn't have sweets that often/drinks sugar free soda but i'm afraid that he isn't losing weight fast enough. I've noticed that he eats a lot of sandwiches and noodles which are high in carbs? and sodium and i really want him to eat better. I feel so incredibly guilty for not stopping him from eating unhealthy foods but i don't know what foods he can have, I just want him to get healthy and mobile and I'll do whatever it takes to get him to that point (but keep in mind that he has tried to go on diets multiple times in the past but he always gains the weight back, he gives up on himself often). I want him to get the help that he needs but his only support is the rest of my family as we can't afford people to come in to help him.

You can definitely enjoy food while being diabetic but the problem comes when things aren't easily accessible so people end up eating whatever is nearby. Look into Ethiopian cuisine they have a bread called injera bread made from teff flour. This doesn't spike blood sugar at all and it's healthy. If hes a big a rice guy then look into cauliflower rice. He can still eat steak, grilled fish, grilled chicken. Go to middle eastern spots and get a chicken shawarma plate with veggies. No rice. For breakfast boiled egg salad with sugar free mayo from avocado oil. There's alot but you gotta explore other cultures and cuisines. All the best! Being active and constantly walking is key

Just make it into a salad :) I like cheeseburger salads, taco salads, stir fry, send me some of his favorite foods maybe we can work together

The decisions are his, not yours. You have no right to feel guilty, nor have you the right to stop him. But you can offer support and, if he is happy to accept it, advice. If he is ready to discuss the problem note that weight loss is not his primary goal; that is secondary to blood glucose control. If he is prepared to learn ask him to read this: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html)

5. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=2, created=2025-09-28T01:36:07]: Something that's super delicious is stirfry bowls. I love chopping up tofu, dicing up zucchini and mushrooms, then sauteeing it all together with some G. Hughes General Tso sauce.

Raw and cooked. With the minimum amount of fat cooked. A little bit of various starchy foods: lentils, white beans or bulgur…. Eat salad as a starter for fiber and with little sauce and only homemade sauce. The rule of the plate: half vegetables, a quarter starch, a quarter protein (meat or fish, or eggs) 120 to 150 grams for a man. Eliminate white bread, industrially prepared meals, non-wholemeal pasta, white rice, white flour (pizza quiches lorraine torte, etc.), cold meats and cheeses in large quantities, fast sugars (ice cream cakes, milk chocolate, white and dark if there is less than 70% cocoa, soda, candy, fruit yogurts or chocolate chips, etc.). Finish your meal with fruit: to still have a little sugar in the diet but with fiber and at the end of the meal exclusively. If he drinks alcohol he will have to eliminate strong alcohol and beer and only consume red wine (one glass per trip maximum) You will find lots of recipes on the internet and you can ask chatgpt for diabetics. Give your father courage by perhaps eating like him to help him: it takes courage to forget the habits of several decades or even of a lifetime. Prepare his meals at the beginning in advance…. Consult this site where everyone has their experience on the subject. Your father is lucky that you want to help him: good luck and good luck to you, it’s doable, there are lots of testimonies here
7. u/JEngErik [score=2, created=2025-09-27T22:21:08]: Veggies of any kind and protein, steak, chicken, pork, rabbit, turkey, etc. You can create quite a number of combos with those guidelines. It's what works for me
8. u/PacRimRod [score=1, created=2025-09-27T20:00:28]: Steak tips, chicken breasts, salmon, air fryer chicken tenderloins, I loved seasoned shaved steaks, omelettes are a staple for me.
