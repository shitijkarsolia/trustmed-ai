===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with T2 approx 3 weeks ago after a blood test for smouldering myeloma showed my blood sugar was 32. Sensequent test was 22 so I was well into the danger zone and endo commented I should have been in the ER at 32. I've brought my levels down to between 5-7.5 with IF and low carb diet but I'm not much of a fan of meat or fish, so looking to supplement my protein with a powder as a meal replacement every other day. What protein powders have you found that work well for you as a T2 ? Bonus points if it's plant based and available in Australia 🇦🇺

The budget part won't be useful to you but I built this tool that will help you plan you macros [https://www.proteinmath.app/](https://www.proteinmath.app/) I presume you're trying to lower your carbs right? Just sort by "carbs" column and see what's available in Australia.

They are pea protein and have superfoods and a whole serving of fruits and veggies per shake. I make it with fairlife protein milk and its so good and filling. The chocolate and cookies and cream flavors are not great, but the strawberry, vanilla, and berry flavors all rock.

I have them both on subscription since I go through them so quickly (chocolate more than vanilla). I have one just about every day for either breakfast or lunch. You can also use the powders foe all sorts of other stuff. I like to experiment throwing random things together and see how it tastes. Almond milk, Greek yogurt, cocoa powder, cacao nibs, sugar free granola, frozen fruit, etc. I've added it to (keto) cookies for a bit of extra protein. It's quite versatile and the best chocolate flavor I've tried (I've tried several, more expensive options and they all had that nasty protein flavor that Premier doesn't have somehow).

Vegan, 400 calories, 40g protein, 23-24g carbs (4-5g sugar, 7-8g fiber) per 17oz prepared serving. I also got an email from them recently that the new formulations coming out this fall will have less sugar and more fiber which is exciting. Note that the non Black Edition powder has much less T2 friendly macros. If you can’t get Huel, Orgain is also vegan and more of a straight-up protein powder than a meal replacement. I used to blend it with cold brew to make a chocolate pb latte and that was pretty great. I still buy the little ready to drink cartons sometimes. Owyn is super low carb and tastes good but the texture is a little slimy. I’m not at all a texture person but even I had some disheartening moments with it lol.

It mixes well in smoothies and yoghurt, and I like the taste. I've tried other brands, and like this one the best because it doesn't have an aftertaste.

11. u/North-Country-2545 [score=1, created=2025-09-28T06:19:00]: Look for protein powder using pea protein instead of whey.
12. u/deacc [score=1, created=2025-09-28T05:39:56]: There are tons available on Amazon (at least in the US). When I do drink them I just go with the ready shake. It depends on whether you are looking for high protein (so high protein and very little carb) or one that is more a truly meal replacement (so more carbs with a good amount of fiber).

14. u/RandomThyme [score=1, created=2025-09-28T02:46:17]: I'm guessing you meant mmol/L and not mg/dL for measurement. This is the protein powder that I use. It is affordable and seem to mix well into things. I mix into my yogurt and various sauces. My husband likes to put a little bit in his coffee. It is one of the more affordable ones, in my area it is available at local pharmacies as well as online. https://www.amazon.ca/BOOST-Protein-Unflavoured-Powder-canister/dp/B01MU99ALM?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB
