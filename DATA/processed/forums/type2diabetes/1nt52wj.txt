Hey guys, I might need to get the mengìtis vaccine for travel but I'm worried about the potential effects. The covid vaccine took a huge toll on me few years ago and I dont do well with vaccines. Anyone take this vaccine? Im not coming for medical advice obviously I should consult a doctor but just general convo with the people about this since we all share the same concerns with family and health. Cheers! Hope all you guys long lives and healthy lives.
