===============================================================================

On mobile so sorry if formatting is weird or if typos happen. Ive been diagnosed t2 almost 2 years now, and its been a journey. Im technically obese. Bmi is a 31, im 5'3 and fluctuate around 165-175. They thought it was diabetes 1.5 or something for a while till I finally got in with an endocrinologist, and she ordered the right testing. I have pcos and there is insulin resistance going on. Anyway, I cannot take metformin, it makes me ill. I was on a combination of jardiance, glimeperide, and long acting insulin and that was working. I was spending more time with my sugars around 150 or so. Cut out as much sugar as we could find in our diet. The one thing I will not give up is potatoes, we cut back though. I lost my job and my insurance at the end of May. I've been getting by with coupons to keep the insulin and glimeperide, but I cannot afford the jardiance. Im trying to try brenzavvy, but its been hard finding a local pharmacy that carries it. Are there any other meds or even diets to help lower my a1c? I can't afford diet books or plans right now. I get 10000 or steps at work, and it would be nice to lose some weight but thats not my focus. Edit: I do exercise. I get 10000~ steps per day. I do understand the exercise is an important part of this, and i could do more in that aspect. Im looking for medication alternatives or links to diet plans that won't cost me an arm or a leg. Thanks!

Doc tried to put me on loads of meds but i wanted to attempt lifestyle change first. Granted there was big shift in lifestyle changes, the only “pills” i’ve taken is a berberine.
2. u/Negative_Joke_1912 [score=4, created=2025-09-30T20:45:50]: What works for me is counter intuitive to most on this forum. Long before insulin, metformin, etc a change of diet was the only cure. If you are seriously trying to manage t2 without meds give a whole food plant based very low fat (10 grams max per meal) a try. Be religious on the low fat and whole foods, shopping the produce aisle mostly. The low fat requirement will cut out all animal products and manufactured foods. Tofu is okay, beans are your friends, and you will be able to eat fruits. After a few weeks your tastes will change and steaks and pizza won’t tempt you any longer. You will lose weight by filling up on nutritious low calorie meals. Cholesterol will plummet, BP will normalize and you will find stability with blood glucose measurements. A cgm is highly recommended. 2+ years since diagnosis with a 9.6 a1c (currently 5.1), never any meds, dropped the statin, don’t need the blood pressure meds, in remission for 2 years. And… I do enjoy my meals.

I've lost 15lbs in 7 weeks so far. I am borderline, and I have Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
4. u/BoogerMayhem [score=2, created=2025-09-30T07:48:44]: Berberine with cinnamon. I take a half dose and it dropped my a1c 0.5. A full dose gives me low blood sugar though. Be careful with it, it’s a supplement similar to metformin but without the side effects in my case. I don’t tolerate metformin.
5. u/PossumHollerKoolaid [score=5, created=2025-09-30T07:05:38]: Check out the Glucose Goddess on YouTube, she is a scientist and I have found that she has some interesting tips that you may not have considered before. In terms of keeping the potatoes in your diet rotation, allegedly if you cook and then cool them first, their starch structure changes and they won't affect your sugar as much. You'll have to use a meter to test how it affects you but it could be worth the extra steps. Google resistant starch potatoes and that will help explain everything further.
6. u/Ok_Tomorrow_7065 [score=6, created=2025-09-30T00:36:31]: Food low in carbohydrates (so no potatoes or very little) Physical activity Maintain regular and sufficient protein intake. And on the medication side, some recommend berberine which is a plant which regulates the functioning of the liver a bit like metformin and would also regulate intestinal transit.
7. u/alan_s [score=3, created=2025-09-29T21:03:04]: &gt;Are there any other meds or even diets to help lower my a1c? This is what I did myself. This method helps you modify your menu for better blood glucose management without going to extremes. It works regardless of whether you are using a meter or a CGM: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)
8. u/Lopsided_Maybe5040 [score=2, created=2025-09-29T18:52:39]: I love potatoes too, but don’t miss them now..Have you tried cauliflower rice, or beans?
9. u/catsandplants424 [score=3, created=2025-09-29T17:36:22]: Not sure how natural it is but my doc told me to try Benefiber powder and it's knocked my numbers down some. He also said building muscle helps, not like a bodybuilder just increasing your muscle mass. Haven't got that far yet as this was just last week.
10. u/PacRimRod [score=7, created=2025-09-29T17:31:07]: Walk after meals, go low carb, no added sugars, intermittent fasting. I knocked mine from 10 to 5.5 from May to September using this. Remember to give yourself 3 months so your glucose laden blood cells can be replaced by the cleaner ones.

12. u/According_Bear_6599 [score=2, created=2025-09-29T16:49:55]: 10000 steps is an amazing start. But it can mean very little other than you’re on your feet a lot… try doing 30 minutes of resistance training to open your muscles to use the glucose in your body!
13. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=6, created=2025-09-29T15:25:24]: &gt; Im technically obese. Bmi is a 31, im 5'3 and fluctuate around 165-175. &gt; it would be nice to lose some weight but **thats not my focus.** It should be your focus. Get down to 140lbs and (most likely) watch all your problems go away.
14. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=3, created=2025-09-29T15:24:51]: If I remember correctly, there is a generic for Jardiance. I don't have insurance either, and my doctor said to use up what I had and she has sent the new prescription to my pharmacy. It is either Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and Invokana (canagliflozin) which are the same time of medication. But the BEST way? Cut down your carb intake by measuring what you're eating. That and regular exercise.
15. u/arguix [score=3, created=2025-09-29T15:06:36]: The Diabetes CODE, Jason Fung you said you cannot afford books. I have found this at library, and it is all available for free in blog form on his web, just harder to find. It is food, and certainly not miracle diet, works for some, but overall still being researched. SUMMARY: very low carb and or fasting
