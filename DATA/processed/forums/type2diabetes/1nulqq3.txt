TW: Miscarriage, TTC Hi everyone, My husband (M32) and I (F31) both have type 2 diabetes. We’re both on metformin, he’s also on Mounjaro, and our A1Cs are both under 6.0. So, medically speaking, we’re actually doing pretty well. The not-so-fun part: we’ve just gone through our 4th miscarriage (all before 10 weeks). Our first loss was before we were diagnosed, but by the second, we both already knew about our diabetes. Here’s where it gets messy—recently a “friend” told me I should basically give up on trying for a baby because, according to her, our child would be born unhealthy and diabetic, and that God is probably purposely not letting us have kids because we’re “unfit.” (Yes, she really said that. And yes, she’s over 300 lbs herself, so I’m not sure why she felt qualified to hand out health shame coupons.) Thankfully, we’re seeing a fertility specialist now, and she definitely didn’t act like diabetes was the apocalypse my friend is making it out to be. But after hearing that comment, I can’t stop it from creeping into my head. I’m not even sure what I’m looking for—maybe advice, maybe encouragement, maybe success stories? Just something real from people who’ve been through this, because the more I sit with my “friend’s” words, the more I start to believe them, and I really don’t want to.

That being said, diabetes *is* genetic, so you and your husband both being diabetic means the child would more than likely develop diabetes in their life too, regardless of how healthy they grow up to be. So that *is* something to consider. But people live long, healthy, happy lives with this disease, so it's technically not the end of the world. There *are* other risks that come with having children while being overweight, both for the child and for you, the mother, so be sure to talk to your doctor about any concerns you might have. A good doctor will address them and work with you. Your friend is not a doctor. Don't listen to her.

It takes a lot of work to keep your blood sugar under control while pregnant (hello, hormones), but you'll do it because you have to take care of your baby. You'll be told they may be born big because of your diabetes, but mine was 7lb 3 oz. No sugar issues at birth. So don't worry about what your "friend" said. If you want to be a mom, keep trying.

Second, your friend is not your friend if they say that kind of stuff to you. Ditch them. They suck. I'm 29, 36 weeks pregnant with my first and she's been perfectly healthy the ENTIRE time. She's 5 pounds, 12 oz as of right now. I don't have any signs of preeclampsia or anything like that. Just because we're diabetics doesn't mean we're automatically going to have a bad time in pregnancy.
