===============================================================================

Hi all- I got diagnosed with t2d in 2023 - I had just turned 37. I probably had it for at least 2 years before that. I am 39 now. In 2023 I was 303 lbs and my A1C was 6.8 I brought it down to 5.7 and my weight down to 230 lbs. Before I got into huge financial issues. And had to pretty much work all the time. My A1C shot up to 6.1 and I gained back 30 to 40 lbs. At this point I have decided to try zepbound. I am going it will help me with my weigh and bring down my A1C. I am really concerned about my feet tho. Every job requires me to be physically active and that affects my feet. I have flat feet and have a few calluses. I also have dryness and also athletes foot. I went to podiatrist recently- they gave me a cream. My concern is obviously if I am in danger of causing damage to my feet with my lifestyle. I am not on any meds but I still do struggle to eat right. I end up binging and pretty much as I used to but not to that crazy degree. But Definitely I am not 100% good with doing the low carb. Can you guys share what you went through and if you ended up loosing toes and having surgery? What can we do to make sure we can take care of our feet? My current A1C has to be back to 6.3 if not higher.

I had a blister on the side of my foot that went septic really fast, I was in his office next day, still ended up with a bone infection but got on top of it fast enough we were able to address it before anything too bad happened. As far as calluses, make sure to moisturize and keep those clean and possibly sanded off. What'll happen basically is you'll start to develop pressure ulcers under them which are no joke. Get sole inserts or tarsil pads that'll put the pressure off of those areas.
