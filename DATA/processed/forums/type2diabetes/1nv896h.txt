I’m curious because I don’t and I feel like it is the best way to manage out of control levels alongside meds. Thanks

But you should eat some healthy carbs, which are roughage foods. Roughage carbs are not absorbed in our bloodstream, but they are needed by healthy gut bacteria. In turn, healthy gut bacteria keep us healthy.

My medication has been decreased throughout the year and will likely decrease again my next appointment with these results! It’s really going to depend on your body. A year ago I couldn’t tolerate any carbs, right now my father has to eat lower carb to control his blood sugars.

It was lowkey hell, now I probably eat more carbs than I’m supposed to but my A1c has gone down and I feel so much better. I think you have to find the balance between eating to feel good and eating to lower your levels. Eventually you’ll find it
4. u/Successful-Cry288 [score=3, created=2025-10-02T10:55:03]: Yes and no - mainly in moderation and focus also on the calories of what I’m eating, so the weight comes down also

6. u/[deleted] [score=4, created=2025-10-02T04:43:25]: Does the whole bucket of popcorn at the Yankees Game count?! I mean is it really a Carb?! I try to eat low carbs in general but they are my absolute weakness. However I try and control it as much as possible and I’ve cut down on eating a lot altogether so that helps. It’s a balance that I aim for daily.
7. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=9, created=2025-10-02T03:32:58]: I eat moderate carbs. Usually around 35g max per meal. I don't think you need to go to keto levels, especially since this is a lifestyle change and keto might not be a sustainable option for everyone.
8. u/uconnbobby [score=7, created=2025-10-01T18:46:44]: I eat low carb - there’s no other choice for me.
9. u/anneg1312 [score=9, created=2025-10-01T18:41:49]: Not everybody, no. I chose to eat super low carb (ketogenic levels) because I wanted to give my body the best chance of correcting what it could without meds. I’m not against meds, but I don’t want to be one anything permanently unless I’ve exhausted non meds approach. So far I haven’t needed them, but they’re there if I ever do. Not that I’ve corrected quite a bit, I still eat low carb… just not keto as much anymore. Also I do intermittent fasting. Keto/IF was literally a life saver for me!
10. u/jack_hanson_c [score=4, created=2025-10-01T17:47:12]: No, I eat Mediterranean diet with moderate carbs
11. u/HipChick73 [score=3, created=2025-10-01T17:26:20]: No - but I’m getting better. I’m on Mounjaro 7.5mg so the first few days I focus on a fair amount of protein bc I’m just not hungry but after that I get carby craving so I eat what I’m craving but less of it. I also follow my sugar readings carefully.
12. u/jaymienicole [score=3, created=2025-10-01T16:44:35]: No. Cuz I'm weak and love pasta. But I have no one to please do my weight doesn't matter and my diabetes is well controlled
13. u/jolard [score=5, created=2025-10-01T16:34:53]: If you are on insulin versus not on insulin is the big difference I think. I am not on insulin, just metformin and low carb. Personally I think low carb (not necessarily keto) is an important part of managing Type 2 for those not on insulin.
