2. u/sweetsaskymolassy [score=2, created=2025-10-05T02:31:18]: I eat those Smart Sweets which are a really just a fibre supplement. I can’t eat a full package because it will make me feel sick, but a few before bed help my sweet cravings and keep me regular!
3. u/HasBinVeryFride [score=2, created=2025-10-03T17:29:55]: Every time I eat one of these "good for you" treats, it just makes me want the real thing. I wish there was a way to not crave sweets at all. I've known several people over the years that did not care for sweets. It must be nice!
4. u/rckblykitn14 [score=3, created=2025-10-02T11:52:30]: Pb cups is easy. Sugar free chocolate chips melted, and the pb is regular (sugar free) pb mixed with powdered sugar (I use Swerve) and a couple drops of vanilla extract. I've eaten the pb mixture by itself several times lol. Easy quick and friggin delicious!

6. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=1, created=2025-10-02T01:30:28]: Almond flour waffles with Cary’s no sugar syrup and whipped cream. No sugar Jell-O pudding with a bit of liquid Splenda whipped up into ice cream in the Ninja Creami.
7. u/gertymoon [score=2, created=2025-10-01T21:56:28]: cold brew coffee, stevia, half and half topped with whip cream.
