===============================================================================

I’m T2D (almost a year since diagnosis), and up until recently was doing a low carb, high protein diet, all the zero sugar substitutes, and everything I should be doing to get my A1C down. I went from 11.4 to 5.9 in about 5 months, which is amazing. But here’s the issue - food is so expensive now, especially meat and alternatives to things I’ve been consuming for months. I have no idea what to eat anymore, and my family’s budget just got tanked to the ground. Everything cheap is higher in carb and I have no idea what to consume when I have to slash tons of money off my budget and feed my whole family in the process. I know some carb sources are supposed to be “off limits” and I’m just trying to get things in check without messing up all my progress. Does anyone have a bare bones type of grocery list or ideas that I can try to use? I have myself, my husband, and one child to feed. Thanks in advance!

Several ways to eat those chickens and the tortillas can be eaten a variety of ways too. The tortillas are $7 and the chickens are $5 each. Thats a lot of food for $20
3. u/Cereal_Killer147 [score=2, created=2025-10-03T08:11:49]: Beans, tuna, rotisserie chicken, soups. I make a huge pot of chili for fairly cheap. Trader Joe’s or Aldi’s ground beef if you have them in your area. I freeze it. Cheese. Veggies can be fairly cheap but I get it. The 1st time I went shopping for everything I spent well over $250! I can’t afford half of that so I had to make some major changes. I make a bean burrito with the keto friendly tortillas that fills me up and it’s full of fiber and protein I add Greek yogurt and cheddar cheese and it’s super filling. I’ll slice up an avacado for a snack. That fills me up. Good luck it’s not easy out there.

5. u/anonhelp11111 [score=0, created=2025-10-02T23:28:02]: Whole grain bread or apples with peanut butter. I make pizzas with pita bread, tomato sauce and veggies. Protein balls made from peanut butter, oats, ground flax. I fill up on cheese quite often. If I eat something with white bread, I'll have a whole can of veggies with it plus protein such as eggs, chicken, or bacon. I make stirfrys with canned veggies and chicken stock cubes. Some people find they can eat pasta without spiking, especially if cooked the day before. Hot dogs with whole grain bread as buns. Plain no sugar greek yogurt with frozen fruit (fruit heated in microwave) and a bit of maple syrup or sweetener. Tuna sandwiches. Pasta salad. Going for walks, drinking water and keeping stress down, getting good sleep.

8. u/Professional_Tip_867 [score=3, created=2025-10-02T17:26:04]: tuna or canned chicken lettuce wraps eggs, for dinner as an omelet or a frittata chicken thighs. over cauliflower rice for you and regular rice for the family french onion soup, without the croutons for you i make gumbo, and I just skip the rice, i make it with file powder and okra in general, I eat a protein and 2 vegetables for dinner. I make a side of roasted potatoes for every one else. what ever is on sale. you can get big bags of frozen veggies for cheap. tofu scramble celery/ carrot/ apple sticks dipped in dressing or peanut butter. buffalo or seasoned chicken legs with celery . it is a very expensive disease.

12. u/Royceman50 [score=6, created=2025-10-02T12:28:14]: Bulk ground beef is 3.75-ish per lb at Chef Store. Amazon has sales on bulk beef for about 4$ per lb. I realize that even 2 lbs a day is 240-300$ a month for one person. When my kids were younger and I was the sole provider that was literally 1/3 of the budget for the month, which is hard to justify when money is tight. Maybe just one lb a day, add brown rice, oats, and beans. And do lots of walking. Seriously 10k steps a day. It'll help regulate your sugars. But yeah, life isn't sustainable anymore.
