But I think it was for the best. A couple of weeks ago, I posted in here, wondering if it was possible for my A1c to go from 9.4 to below 8 (for surgery) in roughly four weeks, since that was the amount of time since I’ve started Metformin and monitoring my blood sugar. I had it tested yesterday. Drumroll please… 8.1. 😂 So hey, at least it’s very clear I’m doing everything I need to do. It just wasn’t quite enough time. I’m fine with that, honestly – the idea of going under the knife in a little more than a week doesn’t thrill me, as there are a lot of things up in the air right now. I think it would be best to wait another month, stay the course, and lose more weight/build my stamina before surgery. Even so, it was nice to see the actual proof that I’m heading in the right direction. 👍🏻
