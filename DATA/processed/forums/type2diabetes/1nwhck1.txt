===============================================================================

I am type 2, 40 year old female, was diagnosed in 2016. I've lost 60lbs since my diagnosis and went from an A1c of 12, to my latest test at 7.3. I am unmedicated, walk 10 000 steps a day and try to eat relatively healthy. My usual energy level is quite good. I work fulltime, am in school and have my hobbies. But probably once a month I get hit with this intense exhaustion that can last a day to several days. I feel like I have the flu, as in, I'm too exhausted to breathe but I am not sick. Sometimes it happens when I have my period, other times not. When I check my blood sugar during this time I dont notice anything really different than any other time. I'm curious if this is something anyone else deals with? Is it diabetes related? Kidney related? Maybe it's unrelated and I'm just burnt out. I should add, all other blood work is normal aside from glucose but sometimes over the years, my eGFR is normal, sometimes that numbers would indicate mild kidney damage but my doc has never felt concerned about it. Thank you to anyone who shares their experience or any thoughts.

I tend to agree with the other comment that medication would likely help if the exhaustion is related to your BG. 7.3 is a good improvement but with that number you’re either hanging out in moderately high numbers or having big spikes. Regardless, this sounds disruptive for you and would be worth talking to your doctor to find out your options.

Make an appointment for as soon as there is an opening. A1c of 7.3 is still too high. You are damaging your eyesight, kidneys and circulation every day.
