===============================================================================

So I ended up buying a liquid death severed lime from the gas station because I've had their cherry seltzer before and it treated me fine, but I read the can after already drinking down half of it &amp; realized it has slightly higher sugar count than the cherry one. I don't have my finger pricker with me at the moment, and can't check my sugar. Has anyone else experienced this and how has it affected them? I know liquid sugar hits faster and harder so I want to what ride I'm in for Edit: forgot to mention, I'm only on metformin 1000mg a day (500mg 2x daily)

4. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=0, created=2025-10-03T06:05:48]: I'd say if you’re worried then just have it with a little low-carb, high-protein snack to give it some balance, but I wouldn’t be worried about 4g.
5. u/MentallyPsycho [score=3, created=2025-10-03T05:52:38]: 4g isn't a lot of sugar, but it also depends on how well your blood sugar is managed normally. But unless your blood sugar is already incredibly high, I wouldn't stress about it.

I only drink alcohol like vodka and gin mixed with sugar free. Your liver burns alcohol first, then carbs. So if you drink a lot of carbs with alcohol the liver "stores" the carbs much longer and is working over time. It gives a high triglycerid and risk for fatty liver, pancreatitis and heart diseases. So once in a while is ok and not with so many carbs. Not english speaking....

I usually like the plain sparkling water one but they have some nice flavored ones) I would just minimize carbs at your next meal and go for a ten minute walk mostly to ease your mind. If you’re well managed it should be ok.
