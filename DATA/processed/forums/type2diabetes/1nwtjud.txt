===============================================================================

Hi! I recently met up with my consultant and he confirmed there are correlations between metformin and mounjaro that make GI/tummy upsets worse. I’m on 5mg mounjaro but it’s when I take metformin that I struggle. I’m on 2000mg a day, two tablets twice a day. The consultant told me not to take it when I’ve just injected mounjaro to see if it made me feel better—it did! But then I took a metformin last night and I feel crap again. Literally 💩 And I’m on the slow release metformin 🎉 He said he doesn’t want to take me off the metformin as it has cardiovascular benefits but I’m not sure what to do as mounjaro is helping my appetite, weight, and sugar levels. He also questioned MODY diabetes as I was diagnosed at 25, told I was type 1 but c peptide was tested ten years later and I was told I was actually a type 2 that’s very insulin resistant. I struggle with ibs too so can’t eat anything fatty. Just wondered what you all thought? Thanks 🙏

I already have IBS so the upset stomach is horrible &amp; can be really bad @ times, the Metformin has made it worse. I had to have gluten free &amp; watch my Dairy intake so I have cut my carbs a lot more bc they just cause really high blood sugar spikes .The only plus side is I am 74lbs down a total weight loss so far of 5st 6lbs since march so my Dr wants me to carry on with the Metformin as it is helping me to shift the excess weight so I've escaped being put on the mounjaro.

I would imagine that means good fats as well? There are other options besides Metformin. Ask about Jardiance. I took slow release metformin for 2 days and was violently ill and was done with it. I decided no meds. I’ll do this on my own with diet and exercise but I know that’s not an option for everyone.

It really made me sick for about a month after that it got considerably better however I would still occasionally get nauseous in the mornings. I've lost about 40lbs since then. My doctor just took me off metformin yesterday and put me on Monjourno. I'm picking up my prescription today. I really hope it's better than the metformin. Good luck
