===============================================================================

Hello! I was diagnosed type 2 fairly recently (PCOS + 2 GDM pregnancies got me). My doctor prescribed me a CGM patch that is working really well for me. For various reasons I have chosen to keep my diagnosis private from my family members, mainly to avoid being the subject of judgement, gossip, and obsession about my health. I’m seeing my doctor, I’m following the rules, so far it’s well managed etc. etc. I know sharing with certain people will be unhelpful so I’m just keeping it on the DL generally. My question is about CGM placement. I know the arm is standard, but does anyone have any experience placing it elsewhere on the body so it’s less visible? I was specifically considering placing it on my glute so it will always be covered. With the holidays coming up I’ll be spending a lot of time with family and I just don’t need this to become a bombshell revelation that then we have to Talk About. I really prefer to keep it private. Anyway, TL;DR - can I stick my CGM on my ass?

I prefer this placement over the “love handle” which I have also heard is very popular because I like to take baths.
