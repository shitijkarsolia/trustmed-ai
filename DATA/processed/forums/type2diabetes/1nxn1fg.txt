===============================================================================

I’m going to Moorfields today for my normal retinal check up. I have had these almond like shapes in both eyes - similar to the shapes u see in vision when u look at bright light. They are usually visible when eyes closed and sometimes there when i open eyes. The shapes are fixed. Now there is a strong line under these shapes- I’m so so worried. Has anyone had this before?

It would point to something else, perhaps addressable, if your blood sugar is in the range you need to keep it in. "Shapes" that don't move sound like retinopathy. Cloudy or darker shapes is how I've heard it described.
