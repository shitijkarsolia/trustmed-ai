My mom is type 2 she's in her 70s. It took a long time but she is on the right amount of insulin. She's always worried about carbs. How many carbs per meal is good? Thanks!

The 'good amount of carbs' is the one that her glucose meter says it's good for her. T2 is a very personal disease ; there are some guidelines that applies to everyone (i.e. Keep carbs low to avoid spikes) but most of it is down to the individual... Hence there isn't one pill that fixes it an why sometime people have to try various medications until they find what works for them. I assume she has a glucose meter? As she should eat..test.. adjust portions for next meals if she's gone too high in her spikes. For most people 100/150 gr of carbs per day (some even per meal) is too high...whilst other can handle that amount quite well with the medications they're taking. It sounds messy at first.. To be fair it probably is.. Until you get the gist of it and things start to make sense, at which point one just need good will power and things will be under control. All the best! 👍

Generally sweets are a very small portion. Monitoring blood sugar through the meter can show if there’s a particular carb that causes spikes, which can be dependent upon the person.
