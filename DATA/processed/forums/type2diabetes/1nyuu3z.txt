===============================================================================

Twice now I’ve taken my kids to the park on a hot day and have had a corresponding blood sugar spike. Not so much as to be completely out of range, but still kind of alarming. Is this a thing? I know sunburn can cause spikes but can just being outside in the sun cause them as well? Or am I especially sensitive? I bring water and wear sunscreen.
