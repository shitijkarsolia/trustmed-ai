Hello all! I’m still figuring out the ropes of this thing, and have a million questions. I’d ask my endo, but she might block me for harassment — lol! Recently, within the past couple of weeks, my sugars have had a difficult time coming back down to baseline. Before, you could hardly even tell I was diabetic! I’m wondering what’s causing these and, of course, I’m becoming a bit nervous. To combat these readings, I’ve started upping my exercise to &lt;10,000 steps a day, with my usual strength training. This helps during the exercise, but then my sugars start creeping up again … I’m wondering if it’s stress related. I am a naturally anxious person and this new diagnosis has not helped. I also haven’t been sleeping properly. I didn’t know what your guys’ experiences were with variations in sugar because of stress/sleep issues. If you want to share, please do!

2. u/Zeus783 [score=2, created=2025-10-07T05:06:57]: Stress, anxiety and being 'pissed off' rises my BG way higher than if I had a whole pizza +fruit + cake in the same meal! Bad sleep does pretty much the same thing. It's all about the chi my friend. 😐 Food is easier to control... Not wanting to kill people (and refraining successfully from doing so) takes a massive toll on my BG 😤

5. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-10-06T14:10:33]: Yes, stress can affect your blood sugars as can not getting enough good sleep.
6. u/PacRimRod [score=2, created=2025-10-06T10:33:40]: First, talk to a doctor. Beyond that, keep a diary of what you are, did you exercise, how stressed you felt ect. See if you find a direct correlation. Yes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol can raise blood sugars.
