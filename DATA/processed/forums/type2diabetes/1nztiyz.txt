Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has gone through something similar. I recently switched from Glipizide to Mounjaro because of the lows I was getting. Since making the change, it’s been amazing. My lows are basically nonexistent now, and my overall glucose numbers have dropped and stayed more consistent. I’ve been on Mounjaro for about a month and a half, currently in week 2 at 5 mg, and things just keep improving. I’m really hoping I can stay at this dose since it seems to be working so well. The only downside so far has been some nausea after injections, but it’s manageable and I’m hoping it fades over time as my body adjusts. Has anyone else here moved from Glipizide to Mounjaro? How did your transition go, and did the nausea eventually settle down for you?

It hasn't been long enough to see a real trend in numbers yet, but it has definitely already killed my appetite. Overall numbers do seem to be trending down.
