===============================================================================

Hi all, Newly diagnosed at fairly young age. I was prescribed metformin immediate release 500 mg BID and I’ve been taking it for around 1 week so far. I have also transitioned my diet to limiting carbs and heavy on protein and vegetable. I feel like I’ve been getting lightheaded and sometimes while eating I feel that way/pressure/headache. It’s an awful feeling. I get this way typically after taking my metformin but tonight I felt it without taking my dose yet. Just wanted to see if anyone also felt this way on metformin and if I just need to give it more time to get used to it? I really just want to know that I’m not alone. I have been feeling awful this whole week while taking it. I also am going to ask to switch to extended release to see if that helps but in the meantime I just needed to hear others experienced this as well and what you did/how long it took for this awful feeling to go away. Thank you so much!

It's not the metformin, it is your blood glucose variations affected by your menu choices. &gt;I have also transitioned my diet to limiting carbs and heavy on protein and vegetable.

Your body has been running on high sugar for a while ; you said you've adjusted your diet and presumibly have significantly reduced carbs... That can and very likely will make you feel awful for a while. I had the weirdest headache when I changed my diet and on some occasion I thougt I was going to die from it. My brain was on fire and it happened every time I put food in my mouth. It actually stopped when I increased carbs. I introduced a square of dark chocolate at the end of my meal and it seemed it took the edge off until it disappeared. It may last a week or longer but eventually does stop.

I was on 1000mg, and dropped to 500, and switched to XR, and they went away. They decreased after the dosage change, and went away completely when I switched to XR. That's just me, though. Please tell your doc what you're experiencing when you ask to switch to XR. There's so much that can play into meds in terms of reactions, interactions, etc. Good luck!
