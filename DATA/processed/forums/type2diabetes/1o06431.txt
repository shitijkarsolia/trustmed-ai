===============================================================================

As the title says. Do I have diabetes? Of course I am not expecting to find a doctor on here but I whanted to ask people who have type 2 diabetes if I might have it. I am only a 16 year old boy. I have had prediabetes for a very long time and I believe I have gotten type 2 diabetes not to long ago. The last time I whent to the doctors my levels were high, close to being considered a diabetic. Fortunately I lost a but of weight and cut out a lot of junk food eich was contributing to my diabetic state. Unfortunately I fell off my diet and returned to my old ways and now I truly regret it. Recently I have started to feel tingling in my right foot and right hand, it started not to long ago maybe about 1 week ago. I have also noticed that my mouth seems to water a bit more often than usual. Finally I have noticed my hair has started to thin a bit. Regarding other common symtoms lime extreme thirst, constant bathroom breaks, feeling tired all the time, bad sleep, and more. I have not felt those. I cant believe I might have type 2 diabetes. I tried so hard but I lack the discipline to prevent it. I dont know what to do. Does anyone have advice? I am scared.

3. u/Zeus783 [score=3, created=2025-10-07T04:34:59]: Pre or official diagnosis won't change the fact your body can't handle carbs as 'normal' people can. You're young and you should look for changes that will stick with you for a lifetime and not just a quick fix to stay in the pre-diabetes zone. Given your age I would focus on other aspects of your life first rather than diabetes itself : do you have a social life? Do you move around or sit most of the day? Do you do any phisical activity? Do you sleep OK? Are you worried most times? Do you like/accept yourself? Are you happy? Focus on personal aspects of your life you are not happy with rather than on a disease that you may well have.. But if you do is probably caused by other elements other then just food (when you say diabetes people automatically think food - Food is the tool to keep it at bay... Causes can be most times found elsewhere). You ve had the first scare (tingling in your limbs), don't wait for the next one as it could be something less pleasant and permanent. Love yourself and diabetes will likely leave you alone. Personally I think most diabetics (not all) need a therapist first.. A nutritionist in second instance. All the best! 🙃

The great news is that you are young so not much damage has happened and your metabolism is strong enough to reverse back to normal fairly quickly (although now extra sensitive to carbs/sugars). I wish I had learned about how to reverse this when I was young! I suggest going significantly low carb with an emphasis on protein and healthy fats… minimal (less than 100g but more than 30g per day) carbohydrates. AND get an a1c, fasting insulin (so that you can get a HOMA-IR baseline reading to know exactly how insulin resistant you are) and a c-peptide. Also, because you’re so young, make sure the type you specifically and monitor it every 3 months to make sure it’s type 2 and not any of the other types. Last, wear a CGM for a month so that you can see how your body reacts to specific foods so that you can adjust accordingly. Avoid spikes of 30 points or more.

Also know- every diabetic suffers from diabetes burnout from time to time. You have to help yourself NOW, as the outcomes aren’t good LATER. Start with seeing a Dr. A school nurse can do a fingerstick to see where you are at. But that’s a one time read. Despite the stigma from some of the societies- diabetes isn’t your fault but control controlling it is your responsibility
6. u/inertSpark [score=3, created=2025-10-07T01:19:37]: &gt;I have gotten type 2 diabetes not to long ago Rather than 'believe' you have type 2 diabetes, you should go see your doctor so that you 'know'.
7. u/alan_s [score=3, created=2025-10-07T00:34:52]: &gt;The last time I whent to the doctors my levels were high What were the actual test numbers and what did the doctor say? Share your concerns with your doctor. That is the best advice I can offer. If you are eventually diagnosed with diabetes - or with pre-diabetes - come back here for some practical advice.
8. u/Small_Slide_8550 [score=2, created=2025-10-06T23:57:57]: Yea go get your a1c done. But the symptoms start even if you are a pre diabetic so just stop all carbs right now! No bread no pasta no pizza no rice nothing No soda or anay fried food No processed junk food or any sugar Just eat salad, chicken grilled or grilled fish Drink water and exercise. Heavy weight training helps
9. u/Fickle-Ad271 [score=1, created=2025-10-06T22:32:18]: A blood test is really the only way to know for sure, and you're going to have to go to a doctor for that.
