===============================================================================

I finally forced myself to see the doctor to get an update on my A1C1 and it came back really good, it was at 5.5 and probably the first time I've been there since being diagnosed. I was at 10.1 in February and my doctor gave me the wake up call that I needed and been working hard to get it down but have been scared to go back for an update even though my morning numbers were telling me I was doing good. Now I just need to keep the train going. It's just a sigh of relief that the work I've been putting in has had results. I should go celebrate with a pizza but I know better now. =) My goal now is to start reducing my medication intake.
