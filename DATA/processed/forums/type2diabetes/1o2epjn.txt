Hi all! Please keep in mind, I am not a professional and this is from my own experiments with dieting. But! I tried a new protein smoothie recipe and it doesn’t spike me. The plus side? It tastes like chocolate mousse! Here’s what you’ll need: Owyns sugar free chocolate protein powder (1 scoop) Oikos sugar free vanilla yogurt (I typically go with the lowest fat option, 2 spoonfuls) Half an avocado 1 tbs of flax seed meal 2 cups of unsweetened coconut milk A dash of cinnamon, as preferred Ice (not too much) Blend all together on medium for about 20 seconds, then enjoy. Please let me know if you try this, and if you like it! :)
