Corticosteroids are [one of the few known medications which can actually cause type 2 diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35791627/). If you already have diabetes it can cause havoc with blood glucose levels. When I was undergoing chemo the oncologist prescribed Prednisone over four days during the infusion period. After my first infusion I saw what it did to my blood glucose levels and halved the dose despite his objections. After the second infusion I halved it again and BGs stayed within acceptable limits. The med was supposed to minimise nausea side effects; those were acceptable despite my reductions.

I prepare all her food. I have not given her any food containing carbohydrates except asparagus. Her BG did not go up at all. I am grateful. Her last A1C was 5.2. She eats less than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day. I cannot advise you on whether to take the rest of your pills. I am not a doctor. I can tell you what is likely to stop your BG from rising above normal.
