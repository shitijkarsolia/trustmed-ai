===============================================================================

Howdy y’all! My 24th birthday is coming up in a couple of months. Cue dramatic music … If you haven’t seen one of my posts by now, which might be impossible because I’ve asked a million questions, I’m new to this T2 deal. My diet has been OK for the most part. Carb-wise it’s been very good. That switch was surprisingly not super hard. However, I could probably do better in the sodium/cholesterol department… My question is: I’ve heard of some folks treating themselves with a cheat meal now and again. Would it be horrible if I treated myself to a slice of cheesecake on my birthday? I have insulin resistance. I know that the reading would not be satisfactory afterward. But is that OK once a year?

I think you will enjoy this, scroll down to Birthday Cake: [Thanksgiving and other Feasts](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/11/thanksgiving-and-other-feasts.html) &gt;My diet has been OK for the most part. Ask your meter an hour after meals if it agrees with your statement: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

They've been replaced by a different keto bakery, but they don't know if they'll be open in 2 weeks. There's another one an hour and a half or so away too. I may go to that one to find me a treat. And if not, fuck it. I'm getting a goddamn slice of regular cake. I don't think there's anything wrong with it once in a while, especially as a birthday treat, and don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.

I had a seared ahi salad first, then a slice of cheesecake, followed by a 2 mile walk. It still spiked my blood sugar, but the next day I went right back to my low carb diet. So, I say, go for it, but keep it to that one dessert.
6. u/deacc [score=5, created=2025-10-12T13:10:53]: Only you can answer that question for yourself. For me personally, it is a no. I will never have a bite, let alone a slice, of my favorite dessert again. I am also not interested in the keto friendly etc version of desserts. But that’s my decision and I know it is a decision that I can live with.
7. u/Soft_Ad1968 [score=5, created=2025-10-12T12:55:51]: Whenever I have a cheat meal or treat that will make my blood sugar go up, I make up for it by going on a fast 2 mile walk. My spike is greatly reduced when I walk after a meal. That’s what works for me but try it for yourself!
8. u/Bippityboppitybeau [score=9, created=2025-10-12T10:17:47]: You are probably going to get a bunch of mixed responses here, but this is how a friend of mine talked me down after i had a bite or two of birthday cake, my blood sugar went up to 200 for the first time in four years, and i was upset. He said “ you have it so under control. Some times blood sugar is just going to have to take one for the team” Once a year on your birthday, cheesecake is going to be fine. As long as it’s once a year. Plan around it. Eat a high protein low carb meal, drink lots of water. Walk before and after dinner. All those things will help your sugar go up less. Maybe eat only a bite or two instead of a whole slice.
9. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=3, created=2025-10-12T10:03:02]: You know where your numbers are and how your discipline is these days, so obviously ultimately whatever feels reasonable to you…but I think it’s fine. I personally find that having a cheat meal/cheat treat goes best if it’s a breakfast or lunch thing and I can walk or hike after to smooth out my BG, vs dinner when I’m less likely to be very active afterward.
