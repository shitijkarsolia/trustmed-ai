My A1C was 13.9 and blood glucose was 457 when I went to the doctor on October 3. I’m finally taking this shit seriously after being diagnosed 10 years ago.

I took my Metformin and only replaced regular soda with diet. About a year and a half ago at 7.3, I finally got serious. I saw a nutritionist who suggested some changes. That got me down to 6.8, but still on 2,000 mg/day of Metformin. I started using a CGM, and after two weeks of finding a good meal plan, an emergency separated me from my meds. To my surprise, my numbers never went up. When I got home, I never restarted my meds. Five months later, my A1c dropped from 6.8 to 5.8 on no meds at all!

I pretty much blew it off for 25 years, and it finally caught up to me. Short version, bone infection, big toe amputation, double bypass surgery scheduled for Wednesday. So yeah, keep kicking ass! There's other stuff I suffered through this year, but those were the highlights.
