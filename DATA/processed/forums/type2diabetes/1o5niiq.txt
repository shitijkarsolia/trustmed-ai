6/30/2925 was when I went to the hospital..I passed out after work while driving home, fortunately I had just parked at a gas station to get fuel..I went to the doctor on7/7/2025 and that’s when my world changed, and found out I was type 2, with a super solid case of neuropathy and an a1c of 13.8. I’ve changed diet added some metformin, Lantus, and some ozempic. Cut out the soda, and eat basically chicken and salad now..except i crave chicken and noodles for some reason even sense I started the ozempic..so o eat that a few times a week also. Today was my 3 month a1c check and I went from 13.8 down to 6.8!
