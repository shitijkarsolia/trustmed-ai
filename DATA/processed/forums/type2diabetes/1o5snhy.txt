===============================================================================

Hi all! I’m a recently diagnosed diabetic, and I’m really struggling. I’ve been having some back pain and I’ve convinced myself it’s kidney pain. How do I know the difference? For reference, I’m on my feet for 8-10 hours at work. I’ve always had back pain but it’s usually my upper back. I’m having tenderness around my lower back right now. My fiancé tried to give me a back massage and I thought I was going to pass out from how bad it hurt. I haven’t noticed any changes in how much I pee. But I’m always tired and fatigued. I’ve been having those issues for years but I’m wondering now if they’re related/exasterbated from kidney issues bc I was getting more energy for a while.

See your doctor for diagnosis. &gt; I’m a recently diagnosed diabetic, I wrote this to help you begin: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.

4. u/joesperrazza [score=1, created=2025-10-13T15:51:51]: I had similar pain. It turned out to be gallstones with a blocked bile duct. Ultrasound saw it. CT confirmed it was not the Pancreas. Robotic surgery removed the pancreas with quick recovery. No more pain. No side effects.

If the pain is relatively stable, and you don’t notice anything weird or new when you pee, it’s more likely to be back pain. Kidney pain would be associated with an infection or a stone, the pain tends to get real bad real fast. You could try Tylenol or ibuprofen to see if that helps, and something like icy hot or voltaren.
6. u/egg1st [score=1, created=2025-10-13T12:02:23]: Do you notice any change when you pee? Is it both sides? Have you changed any level of physical activity recently that could explain back pain. Does the pain ease with ibuprofen or anti inflammatory drugs?
