3. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=5, created=2025-10-14T00:49:04]: I eat anywhere from 80 - 140g of carbs a day, but I would worry more about how many carbs you're having per meal. I usually keep it around 35g per meal maximum, and make sure it's paired with a solid amount of protein.
4. u/alan_s [score=4, created=2025-10-13T19:33:19]: Your best advisor is your meter an hour after you eat those carbs. It isn't carbs per day which matters, it is carbs per meal. Your body doesn't save up the results of your daily carbs for one big spike but reacts with a peak after every meal: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

6. u/Subject_Singer_4514 [score=1, created=2025-10-13T17:22:31]: We are all different. I have had T2 for 22 years that I know of and need to keep my daily carb count down to 20 grams in order to maintain an A1C of 5.2. I am just very sensitive to carbohydrates. I had my dose of carbs tonight with a side order of cauliflower with our fish.
7. u/anonymiam [score=-1, created=2025-10-13T17:07:19]: Wow I do &lt;10-15 per meal. Have done for almost 4 months since diagnosis too... I can't imagine having 100g carbs.
8. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=2, created=2025-10-13T16:46:50]: That really depends on how those carbs are spaced out and what kinds they are. For some people with Type 2, 100 grams a day from high-fiber or whole food sources works just fine, especially when balanced with protein and activity. The best way to tell is by checking how your glucose responds after meals since everyone’s tolerance is a little different.
9. u/deacc [score=2, created=2025-10-13T16:31:56]: It really depends from person to person. Also, one needs to consider total calorie intake as well. For someone consuming 1500cal a day then 100g of carbs will be approximately 27% of total calories whereas if someone was consuming 2000cal a day, then 100g of carbs will be 20%.
10. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=3, created=2025-10-13T16:06:10]: I eat between 100 and 150 per day and my A1c has been steadily reducing since I was diagnosed 13 months ago, but I’ve seen some people on here struggling with their numbers on basically keto (25-30g/day). It will depend on your medications, your exercise/activity regimen, your stress level, and tbh probably your luck.
11. u/RandomThyme [score=4, created=2025-10-13T15:39:05]: It is different for everybody. 100g/day probably wouldn't be enough for me. I feel best at around 125g-150g per day. 30g - 50g per main meal, 3x day and no more than 30g for Mt mid work snack.
12. u/jack_hanson_c [score=2, created=2025-10-13T15:38:50]: No, it’s not. I have 150g per day, my A1C is perfectly fine
13. u/PacRimRod [score=3, created=2025-10-13T15:15:06]: It is too high for me, probably double what I consume, but listen to your doctor, your results, and your body.
14. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=3, created=2025-10-13T15:11:06]: My doc said 50g/meal, 3 meals plus a snack for 250g/day. I told her I do 50g/weekday and 100g/weekend day. She said that’s even better.
15. u/smokinLobstah [score=3, created=2025-10-13T15:10:20]: Everyone is different. No way to tell except try it.
