Newly diagnosed T2D, about five weeks ago. How does everyone go about telling friends and family about their diagnoses, or rather, do they not?

2. u/Dangerous-Agent-9017 [score=1, created=2025-10-17T09:21:08]: I wasn’t going to tell my family. my sister-in-law was visiting and there was a package in the mail and I opened it up and it was a sharps container. I looked at her. She looked at me and I told her about the diagnosis. Made her promise not to tell my brother who is an exercise/food nazi-in the most loving way. I thought about it overnight and called my brother in the next day and she had already she had already spilled the tea. He did not lecture me like I thought he would. I told the rest of my siblings and close friends.

4. u/StandardNo7025 [score=3, created=2025-10-15T12:07:49]: Send a gif of Wilford Brimley
5. u/KerryBoehm [score=3, created=2025-10-15T11:36:12]: I bring it up when I turn down carb heavy food. It’s never been a big deal. I’m not all that social. If I know there won’t be options I just toss a meal in my backpack
6. u/prunesquallr [score=4, created=2025-10-14T17:30:12]: I tell people if we’re going to be sharing food. “Can we get something other than pizza, please? I’m T2, I can’t eat all those carbs”
7. u/AssistanceNo4648 [score=2, created=2025-10-14T15:44:07]: I’ve only told a couple people but they are also diabetics. No one knows what medication I’m taking but one close friend and my pharmacist and doctors. I’m quite a private person so it’s none of their business.
8. u/alan_s [score=5, created=2025-10-14T15:10:27]: I didn't announce it but I did not keep it secret. If the subject came up among family or friends I was honest about the diagnosis. If stupid advice or opinions were offered I either corrected them or told them to shut up.
9. u/jzmariej [score=3, created=2025-10-14T14:44:46]: Diagnosed 2 years ago and I still haven’t told my parents. I’m ashamed.
10. u/ShopNerd [score=0, created=2025-10-14T13:24:19]: Diagnosed 7 months ago now and almost everyone I know is aware now. It was nice to just get it out personally and I knew they'd eventually see my cgm on my arm. Plus I was doing finger poke tests at my hobby night so it was tough to hide from friends. Family wise I mentioned it to explain why I have pills at family dinner or why I'm avoiding eating my granny's perogies since I never used to turn those down. Personally I found it not to bad but there has certainly been some unnecessary attention from coworkers that say stupid stuff but I learned to keep quiet now
11. u/faithmauk [score=6, created=2025-10-14T12:05:45]: I really dont see the need to announce anything lol. My partner knows, but other than that its no one's business really. Im not ashamed or trying to keep it a secret, I just dont see the need to broadcast my personal health issues to every one I know
12. u/Putertutor [score=3, created=2025-10-14T11:19:29]: I was diagnosed 6 years ago at age 59. The only people I have told are my husband, my 2 adult kids and my brother (since diabetes runs heavily down through our mother's side). Oh and maybe 3 friends. Other than that, I would rather not bring it to anyone else's attention. My MIL would feel like she should cook something special for me (I don't expect that). And whether it's a valid feeling or not, I don't want to invite people to play "food police" with me. I don't even want people thinking "Should she be eating that?" This is my demon to slay.
13. u/Alarming-Salary-4935 [score=2, created=2025-10-14T10:44:04]: I’ve only told 5 ppl, that is it !
14. u/Ischarde [score=3, created=2025-10-14T10:36:35]: I have usually regretted telling family anytime I have a dx like diabetes or my heart issues, because THEY make a huge deal. And they try to use it against me. All the little nags....should you be drinking/eating that? Do you need to take your insulin or whatever? Like I can't figure this out for myself. Just you and your medical team are the only ones who need to know.
15. u/SeriousData2271 [score=2, created=2025-10-14T08:10:26]: No need to announce health issues unless you have a terminal diagnosis and you don’t have long to live
16. u/FlowTime3284 [score=9, created=2025-10-14T07:42:51]: I don’t tell people. I know what I need to do and I do it. Not sure why everyone on here makes such a big deal about this diagnosis. Get educated on what to do to keep your blood sugar under control and move on.
17. u/LPoland2014 [score=3, created=2025-10-14T07:31:54]: I only told my nuclear family and friends. We don't talk to my husband's family and they don't need to know my business anyway
18. u/AntGroundbreaking102 [score=4, created=2025-10-14T07:31:39]: why would you tell anybody? it’s nobody’s business but my own. the only person who SUSPECTS it is my mom but that’s bc i live with her and she has made pharmacy runs for me. i have never outright told her nor has it ever been brought up.
19. u/undercover_batgirl [score=2, created=2025-10-14T07:31:00]: A select few friends know, my husband, and my sister. I refuse to tell anyone in my husband's family, as they can be extremely nosy and judgmental, and I won't tell my mother, because she's got issues with her memory, and I don't want to tell her every time she forgets.
20. u/RetiredToExplore [score=3, created=2025-10-14T07:17:26]: One suggestion: I think it is important for you and for others you choose to tell that you are not a diabetic. It does not define who you are. You are the same person who has a problem called diabetes that you need to control or manage.
21. u/Laubster75 [score=1, created=2025-10-14T07:05:09]: My spouse, my sister, and a couple of my brothers know, mainly because at the time, I was having other health issues that were worrying. My parents do not, as my mother would be very critical about it.
22. u/GoldenTortoiseshell [score=1, created=2025-10-14T06:56:58]: I just told anyone whenever it came up. I refuse to tell my mom though because she would feel responsible even though she’s not. We live on opposite sides of the country though.
23. u/AFC_Darko [score=3, created=2025-10-14T06:48:32]: Meh I’ve never really announced it aside for my partner and my parents (since they usually ask about my doctors appointments). I wear my CGM so people just notice and ask if I’m diabetic, I say “yup” and the conversation usually ends there haha
24. u/babytofus [score=1, created=2025-10-14T06:15:16]: If you don’t feel comfortable sharing with people then don’t! I wear a Dexcom CGM so people know before I tell them (or they’ll ask if they’re curious). But I’ve been diabetic since I’m 18, so I personally don’t mind letting people know.
