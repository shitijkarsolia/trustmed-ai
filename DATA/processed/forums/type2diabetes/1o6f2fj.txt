Did anyone experience daily headaches as one of your first signs of diabetes? How would you describe their location, when is their onset, and how long do they last?

In the front of my head and face generally speaking. Usually in the mornings a couple hours after waking and then around 2pm/3pm. After diagnosis I learned they were from spikes happening around those times. They are the first indicator for me that I’ve spiked- within ten min of them my monitor is going off with a high glucose alert. This type of headache lasts until I manage the spike, ten minutes if I walk it off but up to 30 or so minutes if I have to wait it out. When my bg is “low” my head sensation is also the first indicator but it’s more of a swimming loopy feeling, no pain. It lasts until I eat something. Hope this helps.
