Been having trouble digest food lately and its been messing up stomach bad. A while back I saw someone suggest the Kirkland brand fiber but I don't have a costco membership, any other (easily accessible) options?

9. u/ShopNerd [score=4, created=2025-10-15T11:43:53]: Im sure it's been mentioned before but I use chia seeds for some extra fibre. They're best eaten soaked in something so I add them to some plain yogurt with fruit, vanilla, almond milk, some granola and leave it all over night. Adds a ton of fibre with a low sugar spike at breakfast

It has no taste and gives me my full daily servings of fiber. You can get it at cvs, amazon or any grocery store.
11. u/St0rytime [score=4, created=2025-10-15T10:45:23]: I eat a lot of whole wheat grains. Also, I use the Mission Carb Balance tortillas for a lot of things all the time, and one of those has around 18 grams of fiber.
12. u/Subject_Singer_4514 [score=5, created=2025-10-15T10:38:33]: My own opinion is that natural fiber is better than fiber from a can. I eat 2 or 3 servings of asparagus, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, or broccoli each day. I think it is good for me and the carbs in those vegetables do not produce any spike, at least for me. They are also drowned in butter. These vegetables are relatively cheap except for the asparagus.

14. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=3, created=2025-10-15T08:24:02]: Not fiber but something that’s really helped my digestion is taking digestive enzymes after every meal. The ones I use are like 1 or 2g carb per serving I think so depending on your diet you may want to find a zero carb option.
15. u/Jadey13 [score=5, created=2025-10-15T07:58:09]: You can just do regular metamucil. I got a box of individual "on the go" sugr-free packs when I saw them on sale. I remember the discussion about the Kirkland stuff, too. I remember thinking it wouldn't help me because it seeems I'm constantly in the bathroom already. But I decided to give it a try based on the comments. I don't have a Costco membership either. So I got the name brand stuff. I'm only doing 1 serving per day and i have definitely noticed a big difference. It's actually helped me to stay more "regular" if you know what I mean. I've noticed less urge to rush to a toilet at times throughout the day.
