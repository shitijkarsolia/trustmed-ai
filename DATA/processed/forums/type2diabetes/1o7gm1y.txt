Has anyone successfully reversed type 2 diabetes?

I'd also like to add another term that I've discussed with a few health professionals... "Recovery". There have been cases where some people have regained near/ full insulin first and second stage responses. Beta cells that were thought to be impaired or burned out have started functioning normally again... They see near normal diabetic curves with basically anything they eat. This disease truly affects everyone as uniquely as our fingerprints are. Functional remission is entirely possible for everyone. "Recovery" is like winning the lottery.

I was 18 months researching the root cause, reading a great number of scientific research papers as I refused to accept the daily blood testing and uncertain future. I was shocked that nobody knows the root cause of Type 2 Diabetes. It seems the insulin receptors are embedded in the cell wall which is made of fat. So I concluded that it is very important that this is natural fat to ensure the insulin receptors work as intended (avoid insulin resistance) and not industrial fats from vegetable (seed) oils etc. So I eat lots of natural fats and avoid industrial fats. That's it.

4. u/Sorry-Narwhal-7457 [score=6, created=2025-10-15T14:22:49]: I am new to all this, so please take this with a grain of salt, but when I went to the American diabetes association website it said a person is considered in remission if they can "sustain normal blood glucose levels (less than 6.5%) for at least three months without taking diabetes medication". Press release was from 2021. I also read an article published by Yale school of medicine dated February 12, 2025 that stated that diabetes can be reversed if you reverse insulin resistant (lose and maintain weight loss, exercise, and eat healthy), but the article doesn't have any supporting data like trial results.

A lot of hard work goes into keeping it there, and I’m not going backwards. I manage carbs, light weight, lost weight, etc. MJ also helped. I’m not one cookie away from diabetic ranges, but I have to keep an eye on my carb levels. It’s easy to ease up knowing that I’ve been so successful. I had a former friend who was diagnosed as diabetic and went on keto to manage it. She was a big pusher for all of her dang MLM products, hence the former aspect. She declared herself diabetes free and having cured/reversed diabetes. Crazy thing - she went back to her carbs, and her A1C went back into diabetic range. She didn’t reverse anything. She controlled it and then didn’t.

Both of these things technically “reverse” your a1c, but you cannot simply wish it away because your a1c drops to non diabetic range. I’m also someone who would rather still be able to eat carbs I want here and there and stay on my meds for life rather than try to get off meds and restrict forever. Heck no! My a1c at diagnosis was 13.8 and I’m now at 5.3, and don’t consider me “cured”, just in remission (on meds).
7. u/jackbauer24bestshow [score=6, created=2025-10-15T11:46:14]: Agree with the other comments about reversal/remission. My A1C at diagnosis in 2018 (age 38) was 10.2. I was taken off the medication (Metformin) 15 months later to see if I could manage with diet &amp; exercise. The answer was yes. My numbers stayed in the 5.7-5.9 range until I lost 50lbs this past year and my A1C is now 5.2. It's strange...white rice would spike like crazy on me when I would eat it when I was overweight and unhealthy. It no longer spikes me. When I do eat white rice (which isn't that often), I make sure to pair with protein &amp; veggie. Like another poster said, I believe my insulin sensitivity is much better now that I have lost weight. I eat everything in moderation at this point...I do not restrict completely at all. You can absolutely do this!
