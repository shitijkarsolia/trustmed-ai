Between glucose checks, meal logging, and step counts, it sometimes feels like half the day goes into monitoring instead of living. Has anyone found a good way to stay consistent without getting burned out by all the tracking?

I check food labels and be mindful of my choices. Eventually I got a better idea for how things make me feel, what does and doesn't work well for me. It's all about balance, and for me, tracking everything was immensely triggering. I did count every calories and macros and check my levels a lot more for a couple of months after my diagnosis, but I was forced to stop for mental health. If tracking so much is hurting more than it helps, or feels like it's taking over, I would try cutting something. Or cutting back how often you check or something. Try to give yourself some grace.

I used to keep my 5-minute chart up all the time on my phone. Once I figured out a menu free of spikes, I stopped logging carbs (they were often guesses, anyway). Then I eventually stopped logging food descriptions unless I was trying something I've never had before (with the CGM). I configured xDrip to speak my reading out loud every 30 minutes or when the value has changed by 15 mg/dl or more. Every morning, I run a 90-day performance report to get my estimated A1c and glance at my hourly summaries to see if any 60-minute averages exceeded 140 over the reporting period. Glancing at my estimated A1c once in the morning is a far cry from the OCD I was experiencing nine months ago.
4. u/smokinLobstah [score=2, created=2025-10-16T08:35:44]: I don't track steps, and I don't track food, other than to say I know when I've "cheated"...like when we visit friends for a long weekend. I know I'm going to have a few beers and a few glasses of wine while we're there. Tracking it won't change it, but I know when I come home that my FGL is going to be a bit high...then it goes back to the 1teens.
5. u/slowcarbmornings [score=3, created=2025-10-16T00:28:11]: yeah, totally get this. I burned out hard on tracking last year. now, I treat tracking like training wheels. use it for a while, then coast until I start drifting again. it’s kind of a cycle but I’ve made peace with that.
6. u/alan_s [score=7, created=2025-10-15T19:56:26]: I only did it that intensively during my database building period, easing off as I learned which foods and portion sizes are acceptable and which are not. Well before the end of the first year I had moved into maintenance mode, testing when I tried new recipes or often enough to be sure nothing had significantly changed. More on that here: [Do I Really Have to Test so Much?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/im-new-type-2-do-i-really-have-to-test.html)
7. u/Dazzling_Cause_1764 [score=3, created=2025-10-15T18:48:07]: Yep, and I am about to quit. Maybe one last month of tracking. It's been 7 months and the last two days I have had glucose numbers below 100. If that continues for a month, I feel I will fully understand what I have to do and will just continue that indefinitely.
8. u/rckblykitn14 [score=4, created=2025-10-15T16:55:30]: I feel like for me it's become part of my routine. It's a habit now. It's been almost a year and I track my food (losing weight) and numbers (same app) and a couple other things. I just do it without even thinking about it now, honestly.
9. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=2, created=2025-10-15T16:27:11]: First: yes I do lol But also: I added a step count widget to my phone’s lock screen so I can see it without opening an app and that has been super helpful for me. I only have insurance coverage for 3 test strips per day (and no CGM) so usually the only one I have to think about is the second one…first is when I get up, third is usually when I’m about to go to bed, second is the wildcard to figure out what specific parts of the day look like or a specific food is doing. Food tracking is honestly an entire pain in the ass but I like the app I use (Lose It). I also tend to eat a lot of the same things at least for breakfast and lunch so dinner is usually the only one that requires much doing. If you’re more interesting/varied in your food I think you’re just kinda SOL on making it easier unfortunately. Honestly diabetics are unpaid data scientists lol
10. u/Jadelily41 [score=1, created=2025-10-15T15:21:00]: A CGM definitely helps with the glucose monitoring. My Apple Watch tracks my activity/ exercise. I log carb intake through my cgm app, but I also write it in a small notebook. I find writing it down keeps me accountable.
