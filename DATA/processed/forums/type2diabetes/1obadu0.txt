===============================================================================

For those who’ve been living with type 2 diabetes for a while, what strategies really made the biggest difference in keeping your A1C down? I’ve seen so many approaches, from adjusting meal timing to increasing protein intake, and it seems everyone’s body responds differently. I’d love to hear what worked for you (diet tweaks, exercise habits, or medication adjustments under your doctor’s supervision). Sometimes the smallest routine changes end up having the biggest impact.

2. u/Complete-Chair8251 [score=2, created=2025-10-25T14:49:35]: Wearing a cgm was a game changer for me. Seeing how food actually affected me helped a lot. But even more of a revelation was seeing how timing my eating affects me. I basically am doing intermittent fasting now. I used to think my BG was low if I didn't eat something for breakfast but now I see that it isn't. I can wait until late afternoon to eat with no issues. And if I just eat one meal a day I can eat almost anything without my glucose levels spiking. So now I just have a piece of cheese or some other high protein snack in the afternoon and then dinner. It's not for everyone but it works for me. Also a big help was discovering low carb pasta. Partner is Italian and pasta is a staple for us. So now it's guilt free for me and I don't feel deprived.

This diet improves insulin sensitivity. Fat is a cause of insulin resistance. It has kept me off all diabetic drugs for the entirety of my type 2 diabetes journey.
4. u/Hippo_lover76 [score=2, created=2025-10-23T09:19:53]: Diet diet diet. My carbs come from veggies only. And no more caffeine for me. I learned from my cgm that I spike with any caffeine. I’ve also found that if I don’t get solid sleep my numbers go up.

7. u/anthonythagr8 [score=3, created=2025-10-21T10:32:41]: I started drinking more water , and working out with free weights , and bicycling more , I have a stationary bike , in three months I went from 7.3 down to 6.5, in the morning to early afternoon is the best time to drink more water, that’s what worked for me
8. u/awobassboy [score=3, created=2025-10-21T10:26:25]: I cut carbs and upped the exercise. Went from 11.6 to 5.9
9. u/Ordinary-Fish-7840 [score=3, created=2025-10-20T18:11:12]: I am active and very careful with my diet, but my a1c wouldn't come down. I started taking my daily metformin at dinner instead of breakfast and it stopped my body from randomly producing sugar while I slept. Overnight blood sugars stayed in the green and my A1c has gone from the mid 8's to the low 6's. Using a continuous blood/glucose monitor [Libre) has also made a huge improvement managing my blood sugars.
10. u/yamahamama61 [score=3, created=2025-10-20T17:48:37]: Several timess due to allergic reaction. I was unable to eat for 72 hours. After those incidents. My blood sugar was easier to control an my A1-C dropped

13. u/tsarchasm1 [score=4, created=2025-10-20T11:22:57]: No sodas, water and black coffee. So much water. Keen awareness of carb intake. Carbs are important, but not EVERY carb like the before times. I went to Paris. I did not avoid French patisserie and viennoiserie. Moderation in all things.
14. u/Classic_Rise_5331 [score=1, created=2025-10-20T06:45:35]: Keep your body warm by drink hot water in lieu of cold. I am on 20 A1C, I do exercise regularly.
15. u/hrushiyp98 [score=6, created=2025-10-20T05:32:12]: I was on heavy insulin dosage and the dose just went up and up for like a year, I gained over 20kg in that time. But then I did heavy research, talked with people who successfully reversed/ did remission, and consulted over 8 doctors. I figured out that with low carb diet, mounjaro or normal insulin, you can keep your A1C in check but the disease keeps getting worse and worse. T2D is caused by insulin resistance, your body is secreting enough (normally) insulin but your cells have developed the resistance, so taking more insulin is actually counterproductive in terms or the disease. So I started working on my insulin resistance itself. Intermittent fasting, exercise, mostly plan based diet with whole foods and no refined carbs. My diet contains around 110g protein 100g carbs and 20-40g good natural fat. I exercise 4 times a week. Follow my sleep schedule at least 5 days a week. In like 2 months my insulin sensitivity improved as my required insulin dose kept going down, I lost around 4kg of fat whilst retaining most of the muscles, I do consume some dessert and or a sugary beverage like once every 2 weeks and my sugar spike is getting better and within 1.5 hrs my sugar levels come back to around 110-120. With low carb diet, your disease is still there, e.g. some studies have shown that low carb diet for more than 3 months actually worsens your body’s ability to digest carbs, and the sugar spikes after carbs gets worse. I am not a doctor, I am just telling you what worked for me.
16. u/Wall-Live [score=1, created=2025-10-20T05:01:47]: Nutrition- low carb, high protein, healthy fats. When I say low carb, I get my carbs from veggies and food close to a farm. I’m not sure how little but think less than 15g a day. That maybe high. No added sugar, nothing white. Limited seed oil and processed foods. Sleep- dial in often over looked Move- walk, lift weights, or whatever you enjoy. Do it daily
17. u/ImperialAgent [score=1, created=2025-10-20T04:47:05]: I stopped taking metformin 3 months after i was diagnosed because it was ruining my stomach so my Dr said if i can keep my A1C under 5.6 i can stopped taking it and i have been between 5.2-5.8 for the past 7years. I don't take any meds for my T2 just be mindful of what i eat, low to no sugars, low to no carbs, walk 3miles as much as i can during the week . Some foods that you wouldn't think were low carb/sugar but are: Buffalo wings (mind the flavor) most dry rubs are not to low sugar/carb, peanut butter be mindful of maker, pork rinds. Good Luck takes adjustment but once you get the hang of what you can and cannot eat too much of you will do great.

19. u/driftwooddreams [score=2, created=2025-10-20T02:21:21]: Echoing several other posters here, but being prescribed Mounjaro for my diabetes has been transformational for me. A1c went from 12 mmol/Lt to 6.6 a week after my first 2.5mg injection, 5.6 after the second shot and now I’m 20 weeks later maintaining at 5mg per week and A1c is consistently 4.8. It’s also helped me make significant improvements in my diet and latterly exercising as the well publicised weight loss effects have kicked in. I don’t believe in miracle drugs and would never advocate for others to copy my choices but Terzepetide has changed my life significantly.
20. u/cinnawitch [score=2, created=2025-10-20T02:00:36]: Mounjaro plus shifting my diet to have nutritional carbs (like multigrain bread, non-starchy veggies, etcetera - stuff heavy in fiber), while still having my “fun” carbs once a week (waffle fries and King’s Hawaiian bread rolls, my beloved), just paired up with much more protein to make it easier on my system. And of course being extra diligent about my physical therapy exercises, which I was already doing but struggling with - once I was on Mounjaro and it was taking care of my symptoms of high blood sugar, I had more energy and less inflammation, making my exercises feel tough but manageable instead of absolutely soul-exhausting. In December it’ll be a year since my diagnosis at age 31: my A1C on diagnosis had been 8.6%, my fasting blood glucose had been 220mg/dL (12.2 mmol/L), and my weight was 320lbs (145kg) at 5’0” (~152cm). I started my (very little, frankly!) diet changes and got on Mounjaro in January of this year, with gradual titrations up over time. Now I’m 32, and as of last week, my A1c is 5.2%, my fasting blood glucose is 70mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and my weight is 240lbs. I feel SO much better, in every imaginable way, and feel extremely lucky that this has been made possible for me, after my initial diagnosis brought me so much confusion and fear. I will probably titrate up to 12.5mg Mounjaro when/if the weight loss plateaus, but once I’ve hit my desired goal with that, I will eventually drop back down to around 7.5mg at most in the long-term.
21. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=2, created=2025-10-20T01:43:21]: It started with lowering carbs to about 50 per day and religiously inputting my meals into the Weight Watchers app to lose weight. I had to lose a lot of weight and while the low carb’ing got my numbers in check, the weight loss changed the dynamic completely and stabilized my numbers. I can certainly eat many more carbs per meal now without spiking.
22. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=5, created=2025-10-20T01:05:52]: For me: IF 16:8 &lt; 100g carbs/day Weight loss Regular exercise (walking upto 10km 2x or 3x pet week, cycling upto 20km 2x or 3x per week and finally strength training)
