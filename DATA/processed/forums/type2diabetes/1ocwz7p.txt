===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2019 right before covid threw a monkey wrench in all of our plans. I felt like controlling my diabetes was pointless (but that's a little dark, so we wont dive into my reasoning). Years later, I went to the doctor thinking I had a UTI (sorry if thats tmi). However, my blood sugar was the real culprit, over 500. They didnt give me a hard number. They just said I might have to be admitted, but ultimately let me go home. Shortly after that, I lost my insurance, and I was in a dark place for a bit. But 6 months ago I got insurance again, and my a1c was 10.2. I quit drinking cherry coke and started taking mounjaro and got very ill so unfortunately we had to discontinue the mounjaro. At my 3 month recheck my a1c had gone up to 10.7. I had been replacing my beloved cherry coke with snacks, and not good ones. So I saw a diabetic educator. I got a CGM. They put me on metformin (er!), glipizide, and pioglitazone. I made changes to almost everything I'm eating and I'm starting to exercise. At my last 3 month check my a1c was 5.6, and I can't wait to see what I'll do with the next 3 months. ❤️

I've been fighting my a1c for a very long time. 9 something is the lowest I've gotten but currently it's at 10. Also I'm on Ozempic, and finally got a CGM. And insulin! Can't forget that stuff! My problem is I get burned out and tired of needles on a daily basis. My issue is
