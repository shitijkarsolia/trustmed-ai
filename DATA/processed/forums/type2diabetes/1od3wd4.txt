Blood glucose management is all about carbs and has little to do with fats and protein, although those can affect weight loss. Get your blood glucose management right and weight loss becomes much easier. I wrote this to help you do that, let your meter be your guide: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

I still feel a little of it but much less than when I started. When I feel that it could get worse I have a fruit. I also add slow sugars to my meals. It's less often but it still happens: I wonder if it will last a lifetime. It must be said that I lost 25% of my weight in one year: that shouldn’t help.
3. u/Zeus783 [score=2, created=2025-10-22T07:49:37]: It's not typical for someone without diabetes to hit 200 after a decent meal... Not unheard of.. But it would imply loads of carbs to spike to that (imagine a pizza or two +fruit + desserts) .. Also 5.8% is borderline... May want to wear a CGM for a week or two to understamd your BG better?
