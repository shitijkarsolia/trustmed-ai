===============================================================================

Hi all! I was diagnosed a few months ago (23F, 5’8, 110lbs). My doc says I got the news early enough that I don’t need to start medication (my A1C was a 4.6, fasting glucose was 85, but my glucose tolerance test hovered above 200 for hours). No antibodies. It’s type 2, probably caused by PCOS and an extremely poor diet. My new diet has been OK so far. I’m eating around 50 carbs a day and I prioritize protein above the other food groups because I work out (strength training/walks). I’m not being super careful about cholesterol because keeping that below 200mg a day was making me lose weight like crazy (went from 125-108). Here’s the deal. Idk what changed but the food noise has been catastrophic recently. I cannot think about anything besides food. I get so depressed while I’m in the middle of a meal, because I know it will end. Wanna hear how dramatic this gets? Word: I literally daydream about getting diagnosed with something fatal so that I can just fucking eat. It’s giving me panic attacks. I’m losing sleep. I’m not hanging out with my friends or family because I know they’ll be snacking. Yesterday I felt suicidal because the constant need for food is so overwhelming I feel like I can’t take it anymore. Does anyone have this issue? What does a girl do lol!! And please don’t recommend exercise. My leg is fucked up now because I literally walk so much 😩

Heredity apparently For me the "noise" was due mostly to the fact that I never really paid attention to what I ate before. As soon as I tried to restrict certain things....those things were ALL I craved. It has been 20 years and the cravings still exist, but here are some things that helped me Your body/mind WILL get used to less sugars, but the first several months were really hard. I drink A LOT of water. Keeping my stomach full helps w hunger pains. My Big Ass Stanley comes w me every where Friday is my cheat day. I call it F\*ck It Friday. At first is was a day to eat everything I craved. Now it is mostly a day to simply not pay attention to what I eat. Don't let occasion stumbles trouble you too much. It is a marathon not a sprint Eat the carbs last. There is a huge difference in sugar spike if you eat your 50 carbs on an empty stomach vs after a meal of protein and fat
2. u/anneg1312 [score=3, created=2025-10-22T13:42:59]: My food noise goes up when 1. I’m averaging too many carbs and not enough fats so that I get bumped out of nutritional ketosis. OR 2. My hormones go nuts at period time (now no longer an issue).

4. u/EggieRowe [score=2, created=2025-10-22T12:27:06]: For most people dietary cholesterol is a non-issue when it comes to LDL. It's saturated fats (and carbs) that are the main factor. [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dietary-cholesterol-does-not-matter](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dietary-cholesterol-does-not-matter) Are you eating enough calories for your level of activity?
5. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=10, created=2025-10-22T12:07:27]: It sounds like you have insulin resistance from PCOS. Im not sure where you live but I have never heard of a t2 diagnosis with an a1c that low because the typical criteria for diagnosis is A1C being above 6.5 or 7. Honestly it doesn't sound like this Dr is helping you? You don't really need to lose weight OR lower your a1c so I'm not sure why the extreme diet restrictions. Managing pcos would be more helpful, which from the sounds of it means you need to eat more. Not just more of anything but specifically protein, fiber and a balanced amount of carbs to keep the food noise down. Your body is telling you it's hungry. Depriving your brain of carbs isn't always the answer. We use them for everything, even just thinking uses carb/sugar stores for energy. This is all just my opinion. It sounds like this Dr doesn't have knowledge of pcos and is trying to treat you as a t2, but even then your a1c is not high so there's not a need for extreme restrictions. I would ask about specifically being treated for PCOS. Ofcourse this doesn't mean you aren't diabetic or won't become diabetic as many with pcos develop type 2. But your treatment plan seems like it's not fitting your actual test results and symptoms.
6. u/jericbear [score=4, created=2025-10-22T12:03:55]: I totally understand. I have always lived with this. I have a rare type of synesthesia that makes me taste sounds. I hear words and sounds and they literally make me taste certain things (the word noise makes me taste Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, as an example). Food noise is unbearably hard with Diabetes. I have no good solution, just wanted you to know that you're not alone. I do sometime have to indulge myself with a bite of something. It does help when you're going crazy from it.
7. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=7, created=2025-10-22T12:00:55]: I don’t have this issue but your current weight is considered underweight by the BMI index. You were on the low end of healthy at diagnosis. I would wager that the food noise is related to your body panicking that you’re starving. I would do some math to figure out how many calories you should be eating for your age, body size, activity level, etc and make sure you’re eating enough—and/or ask for a referral to a dietician because honestly general practice is not really the place to get nutritional advice. Sorry you’re having such a hard time!
