Alright yall so I’m new to this, been dieting for almost a year. Some days I’m a little less careful with my sodium and stuff but it’s usually pretty OK. Carbs I’m doing fine with. Well. Today was different. My cravings have been horrible recently. My depression has gradually intensified after being officially diagnosed a few months ago and all I want is tasty, SATIATING food. I still plan to ask my endo if I can have a slice of cheesecake on my birthday lol. Well today, I was gonna be a little bad. I love Caesar salad - specifically from my favorite restaurant. Super salty, super fatty, delicious. I know it doesn’t spike me but it’s far from healthy. Tell me why these wonderful people put 4 huge cups of the dressing in my bag for a side salad. Tell me next why I DRANK THEM LIKE SHOT GLASSES. Man I’ll say this. When you haven’t been salting anything, doing that makes you feel like the image I attached to this post.

My birthday is tomorrow and I found a keto bakery about an hour away that I'm going to tomorrow to get a small treat but I'm also ordering a keto Boston creme pie for pickup the following week. I'd suggest looking for a keto bakery in your area, or even a recipe to make your own (there are definitely plenty out there), but if not, one slice of cheesecake for your birthday isn't going to hurt you.
