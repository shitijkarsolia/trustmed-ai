Hey guys! I started taking mounjaro back on September 8th and was placed on 2.5mg once per week. On October 21st I returned to the doctor on a follow-up to see how I was doing on mounjaro and he was very happy with my progress, I also lost 11 pounds between August 14th which was the last time i saw him and October 21st, I was also checked my weight twice when I went to see my Cardiologist twice on September 23rd and October 1st. My doctor seeing my progress decided to increase my dosage from 2.5mg to 5mg per week. My question is, should I expect side effects to worsen at first, remain the same, or possibly have lesser to no side effects at all? When I first started mounjaro I was dealing with very bad stomach pain and nausea so I am hoping not to worsen with this increase. Thanks in advance!

My body adjusted to the med and most side effects went away. The same was true of the move up to five no serious side effects. I am now on 7.5 and generally have no side effects. Sometimes the side effects are worse if you eat the wrong thing. food stays in your stomach longer so. If something upsets your stomach that you’ve had to eat. The effect will last longer.

Looking back, I don’t know why I had to move up to 5.0mg as the 2.5mg was working extremely well to reduce blood glucose (and I happened to lose about10lbs. In the first month). I wished I stayed on 2.5 mg as long as it was working; and later moved up to 5.0mg. I think the medical community is too quick to follow pharma suggestions. Been on 5.0mg for last 15 months. Blood sugar a1C at 5.8; initial weight loss of 30 lbs, but now it stands at 15lb. net loss which is fine.

Good news is if your side effects are bad at 5MG, you can always go back down to 2.5 and just lose weight a little more slowly.

But the 5 also didn’t work as well as the 2.5, my food noise got worse and my cravings came back. I don’t know why. Some people will have no side effects, some get worse and some get better, there’s no way to know what will happen with you until you try it.
