===============================================================================

I am still very new to this, got diagnosed at the beginning of October, I have a Libre 2 CGM. First 2 weeks the sensor was on my left arm, and I had zero issues, seemed to match up pretty closely with finger prick readings. But when I went to my second sensor I placed it on my right arm, at the upper back of the arm, and I kept getting low readings that were super off with the finger prick. I recorded my info and called and got a replacement. Then I put a new sensor back on my left arm, no issues. Now it's time for a new sensor, and I'm back to my right arm, I placed it about center between elbow and shoulder on the back of my arm. And I'm once again getting super low readings and alerts. For example it just said I was 3.9 and going low when the finger prick said 6.7. What am I doing wrong? Is my right arm just bad for the sensors? Am I placing it wrong? I'm so lost.

Sensor after sensor, no matter the placement, have been running low and keeping my anxiety high. Some of them will work for a couple of days and be spot on and then totally nose dive while others will always stay 15, 20 maybe 30 points low. I’ve had it with bad sensors. Back to a regular meter for me and spot checks. The past two days have been so much more relaxing for me.

I use the dexcom g7..I’ve tried on the back of my left arm but would loose connection a lot and also was bumping..I have moved my location to my chest, above my left left peck area, and have had great luck, I don’t bump it and I seem to be within 5-10 units within a finger stick almost always, sometimes closer! I watched a few YouTube videos when I first got mine in best locations, don’t be afraid to experiment a little, I hope you nothing but the best of luck!
