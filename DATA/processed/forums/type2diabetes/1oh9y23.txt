Hey everyone, I'm actually kinda excited about my progress on my hba1c, but since it's been my first time, imma give a bit of back story. On April 2025, my hba1c was 12.5 and I ignored it until 2 weeks after my birthday. After that I went to the clinic, gimme the diagnosis and was given Jardiance Duo 12.5/1000. However, that medicine gimme DKA, admitted for 5 days and I have to change my medicine to Janumet XR 50/1000. I stay consistent on the medicine, workout a lot and intermittent fasting of 16/8 or 14/10, depends on the day. Did I diet? Yes but not that strict. The only thing that is constant is no sugary drink, I do have donuts and ice cream once in a blue moon. Now, I got my new result just now, and my hba1c is 5.9. Not gonna lie, I'm way happy that I achieve it. I will continue on my journey to be a better person. But I have to admit, my weight only decreases from 111 kg to 105 kg in these 4 months of recovery. Btw I'm male at the age of 28. I was reading thru all the post here as a lurker, to give me idea on how to lower my hba1c and thanks to you guys, and the medicine as well. I'm able to achieve my current hba1c. You guys are the best!
