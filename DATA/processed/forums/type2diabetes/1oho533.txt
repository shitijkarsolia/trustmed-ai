===============================================================================

I was just diagnosed by my PCP and I am so confused. I can’t get in to see an endocrinologist for another two months. I have a monitor and a prescription for Metformin and that’s…basically it? Forgive me if this is a dumb question. My glucose when I woke up was 156. It’s past my lunch time now. I’m a teacher and some days I just don’t have time to eat. But now I do. So I took my glucose at 3 PM and it’s at 136 even though I haven’t eaten since 10 AM. But I’m HUNGRY. Do I just…not eat? I’m stuck at work and all I have is my lunch which is chicken breast, broccoli, and a small serving of brown rice. Do I just eat the chicken? Should I stock up on non-carb food to keep at work? I’m so confused about how this works and scared that I’m doing damage to my body since I’m not understanding this.

First: please take reddit information about type 2 diabetes with a grain of salt. You need to fuel your body, and a fasting glucose in the 130s isn't bad. Eat when you are hungry- even the rice if you want it (it's important to eat all foods and learn through your glucose monitor how your body responds to different foods at different times, anyway). You might find you need lots of high protein, high fiber snacks during the school day to keep you going. There are so many amazing options! If an endo appointment is hard to come by, ask your doctor if they can refer you to a clinical pharmacist. My diabetes care is managed by my clinical pharmacist. That may be a quicker and more accessible option right now. Diabetes is scary and can feel really lonely; be gentle with yourself. And thank you for being a teacher!

3. u/Cereal_Killer147 [score=1, created=2025-10-28T19:24:21]: What do you want to do? Do you want to be on meds or do you want to crush it and cut out the garbage? I was told to take insulin and metformin and to “eat better” oh she also wanted me on a statin when my cholesterol is normal. I don’t like taking meds. I cut out 95% of sugar and stopped eating carbs. I eat healthy colorful foods and a lot of fiber, protein and healthy fats. FIBER IS A MUST!!! Even if you walk for 10 mins after you eat, it’s helpful. If you don’t want to change your diet the. Take the meds. TikTok is loaded with help. I eat breakfast and a big lunch and that’s it. No snacking, lots of water. If I’m really hungry and I need something, I eat string cheese but start cooking more. High fiber is so important. Good luck 🍀

I was given exactly what you listed, except one more piece of advice: "Eat better." Gee, thanks. You've already received some great advice here, so I only have one more tip I rarely see in the DM subs. You can save dozens of hours searching Reddit for posts like yours by using Reddit Answers instead. It's like using the Search function, but it provides a conversational interface. All the answers it gives come from content already provided in other Reddit posts and their comments. It cannot make things up when answering and offers links to every post and comment that contributed to the answer given. It will never tire of answering your questions and even suggests follow-up questions to ask if you can't think of any. So please, go crazy with your questions. You will see everything we've said across all the DM subs over the years. https://reddit.com/answers

6. u/Routine_Inside7341 [score=1, created=2025-10-28T05:55:38]: Ask your GP for a prescription for diabetes classes. my local hospital offered them and I could take them online. they were invaluable and I managed to lower my a1c significantly. as for lunch I would eat the chicken and broccoli and skip the rice.
7. u/Spinalstreamer407 [score=2, created=2025-10-27T21:55:22]: Just cut the carbs.
8. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=7, created=2025-10-27T14:35:24]: Eat! Your blood sugar can actually increase from not eating…go figure, right? If your liver thinks you need energy it’ll dump glucose into your bloodstream (so helpful! lol). Keeping low or no carb snacks readily available is helpful, especially if your options are sometimes eat a snack or eat nothing. That said, the conventional advice for T2 diabetics is to avoid snacking between meals to allow your BG to get lower again. I feel compelled to add, since I just mentioned a piece of dietary advice: there are a TON of dietary approaches that have helped different T2s. Low carb, keto, carnivore, vegan, Mediterranean, intermittent fasting, one meal a day, several small meals, 3 meals with no snacks, 3 meals with snacks, etc etc etc etc. It’s tough because a lot of people on Reddit tend to speak as if the way they eat that controls their BG is THE WAY to eat to have success with BG control. The reality is that there’s probably more than one thing that works for most people, and the biggest concern imo is how sustainable your new dietary path is for you. You’ll have to figure out what works for you - medically, ethically, logistically, lifestyle-wise, budget-wise. Testing to see how different foods affect you will be really important as you figure that out. And I second the advice to walk more if you can :) For both your stress level and to help control your BG (which stress can affect).
9. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=4, created=2025-10-27T13:17:23]: Eat your lunch. Be aware that metformin can cause explosive diarrhea when you first start taking it, especially after a meal with a lot of fat in it. You got more instruction than I did from my doctor. They don’t seem very educated or just don’t want to spend the time. Do some internet searches, focus on fiber and protein, and keep taking your medicine.
10. u/Mtnmaggots [score=0, created=2025-10-27T13:03:48]: This seems to be the same story for so many people, myself included. I was diagnosed five months ago and given exactly the same thing. Scared, confused, angry etc. I can say the one thing that helped tremendously was walking. I use ChatGPT to help me with my diet ALL the time. I make sure to get a minimum of 10,000 steps in a day. If my bg reads high for no apparent reason, I walk. Only 15 minutes will bring my level down a considerable amount. I always eat vegetables BEFORE I eat protein. Seems to help avoid big spikes.

12. u/GreenLetterhead4196 [score=4, created=2025-10-27T12:43:07]: Ok that’s not a terrible fasting glucose so that’s good. Focus on eating low glycemic foods. Like most veggies, meats, cheese, berries. Hard boiled eggs and cottage cheese are my loves. Nuts and pumpkin seeds are low glycemic. One day at a time. I think there’s 42 (at least) different things that can affect your blood sugar, such as stress or sleep or illness. With metformin, have a solid protein breakfast with it. You got this!!!!
13. u/usafmd [score=3, created=2025-10-27T12:42:15]: Sounds as if you are recent patient. Since you are a teacher, you presumably value education. Reddit cannot compete with the comprehensive and well-considered presentation of a credentially medical professional who is an author. Find a well-regarded book written by an MD, or maybe in your case, a dietician. You have a few years during which you can turn this disease process around. I personally would not waste this window.
