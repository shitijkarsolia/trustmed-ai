…from being tied to a CGM. I know I’ve said it before, but I kept hoping the next sensor I put on would be the start of more accurate readings. I couldn’t take the Libre sensors being faulty and always on the low side. I’m talking 20 to 30 points and that is with the delay. The last sensor I had was ok for about three days and then started trending lower. I was sitting here and boom alarms going off and it was reading 63 and dropping. A poke and I’m sitting at 97 so I said that’s it and I ripped off the sensor. I dunno, maybe it’s me, but the past three days have been far more relaxing without it. I got too hung up on every swing down I‘d see on the app that would shoot my anxiety to the roof even though I knew it was most likely a false reading. Initially having a working CGM was a game changer and I’m not saying they’re useless. If I felt that the tech was more stable I’d keep wearing one. I love data, but for me it became an obsession. So now I’m figuring out a good schedule of just checking with my regular meter and letting how I feel determine if I need a spot check. Anyone else who has good control given up on them?

Last December, after many years, I gave up on skin-mounted CGMs (Dexcom &amp; Libres) and switched to the annual Eversense 365. By far the best CGM we have available. No more operational problems (such as compression alarms, early failures, inaccuracy, weekly replacements, MRI compatibility and more). And saved out-of-pocket insurance costs of +$500. My yearly total was $108. I am tightly controlled, and my A1C is 5.4. It was not possible until I had an accurate and dependable CGM.

I did discover I have reactive hypoglycemia or whatever its called. So if I have potatoes, refined carbs or white rice without enough protein and fibre, my sugar drops low. Then I need a fast acting sugar like honey, and a balanced snack or meal with protein, fibre and whole grains. But I obsessed too. And it was always falling off or getting knocked out or bent so I gave up
4. u/thestenz [score=4, created=2025-10-28T12:33:19]: I had the same problems with the Libres, and unlike the Dexcom's you can't calibrate them. I was sick of all the low alarms. Also annoyed that Abbot doesn't employ more programmers and keep their software up to date. It's a bad product all around.
5. u/moronmonday526 [score=1, created=2025-10-28T07:57:45]: Seeing a nutritionist helped me reduce my A1c from 7.3 to 6.8 on 2,000 mg/day of Metformin—no insulin or other meds. Adding a CGM showed me more changes I needed to make. I quit my Metformin cold turkey and reduced my A1c from 6.8 to 5.8 using diet alone. I used to stare at my CGM all day, but I eventually got over it. Now, I run a 90-day report every morning and see how things are going in general. I still watch closely when eating something I've never had before with a CGM, but I don't stare at it all day anymore. I may quit the CGM if my insurance stops covering it. I may also drop down to two weeks every month or two before eventually giving up.
6. u/Shinkai2008 [score=5, created=2025-10-28T07:20:52]: Never had any interest in a cgm. I've been always checking my glucose twice a day at the same times since 2018. If for some reason it's higher than normal at a check, then I'll make a mental mark of what I ate before that might have caused it. A cgm, imo, makes some people, particularly newly diagnosed, panic over little ups and downs. It's akin to subbing to the Nextdoor app and then panicking at every little crime that happens in your neighborhood. Checking twice a day is like reading the morning newspaper and watching the evening news where you get smaller and more mentally manageable doses of daily information.
7. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=2, created=2025-10-28T05:46:18]: I am not insulin dependent or I would feel differently about my libre CGM (the plus is so much better) I am not looking for 100% accuracy. I’m happy with 80%. The CGM.Basically tells me how I am responding to foods and the effects of exercise. Including lack of. However, I know what you mean about low alarms! When I get one, I just ignore because I never go low. It has helped me tremendously. As the saying goes, it is what it is.
