===============================================================================

So for context, I had DKA once, when I first found out I was diabetic 5 years ago. I thought I had a bad UTI, and maybe a flu because my head was feeling very foggy, but upon going to urgent care, I was directed to immediately go to the hospital, as I had DKA. Today, I woke up and had that same ALMOST painful, frequent urgent urination. I checked my blood sugar between trips to the bathroom, and at first it was 300 and I almost rushed to the hospital right then and there. But then I realized I hadn't taken my Metformin ER in a few days, so I took it, and have been drinking lots of water to try and help flush my system. Over the last hour and a half, the urination urgency is mostly gone, and I've been checking my blood sugar every 30 mins, and it is now down to at least 250. Should I be considering this as DKA still, and go to the hospital? Or just keep monitoring and hydrating before making an expensive decision? My financial and insurance situations are both not great at the moment, and a trip to the hospital could very well be a lot more than I can afford right now, so I don't want to go if I'm just over reacting. And just to add, I know my numbers are very bad right now. Please don't drag me down over it, as I've been in a rough place these past 7 months, and my mental and physical health have taken a massive hit in the process

I think you should still go to the ER or urgent care or something. It might not be DKA but wouldn't you rather go in and find out that it's not than stay home and possibly get worse and worse? It might not even be DKA but something else entirely driving the numbers up like an infection or something.
