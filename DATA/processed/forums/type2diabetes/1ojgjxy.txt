===============================================================================

I'm 36F of previously excellent health. I am experiencing a significant decline following the birth of my third child with apparent metabolic dysfunction. Recent lab results: Fasting Glucose: 94 Fasting Insulin: 12.2 C Peptides: 2.2 HOMA-IR: 2.8 A1C: 5.4 Further context: approximately one year ago, I had an a1c of 5.6 on my prenatal labs. This was high for me as I am extremely active and health conscious. I am 5 ft 9 and weighed approximately 122 pounds at the time. I was evaluated by an endocrinologist and my FBG was 87. Due to a complete breakdown of circumstances, I didn't receive proper screening during my pregnancy for gestational diabetes. My doctor used A1C instead of the standard OGTT which I now know mean nothing. Fast forward to post partum, I began checking my blood sugars at home and realized they were highly elevated, suggesting I may have had missed gestational diabetes. I pushed for a functional test and additional labs and things were high enough that my doctor put me on metformin for a month. I do not fit the typical picture for T2 or insulin resistance because I am thin, active, and have never had glucose issues before. For the last two months I have meticulously controlled my diet, used metformin for a month, and my numbers have only worsened. I'm extremely dismayed. I will also add that I developed horrible eye floaters during pregnancy (doctor ruled out any retinopathy). I also have low c3 and c4 complement levels (75 and 10). I have lost a precipitous amount of weight postpartum and now weigh only 115 pounds. I have struggled to keep weight on. I will also add that my covid antibodies are high and have risen from 12,000 to 15,000 in the last 2 months despite no repeat infection. Does anyone have any ideas at all? I feel like I'm fighting for my health and it's terrifying.

Have you chased every possible route to _thorough_ clinical assessment? Scratch Hugh Laurie; he’s just an actor. But someone like him who will go to the mat ‘til you/they get this figured out.
