===============================================================================

I (49, F) was diagnosed in September after my OBGYN requested pre-hysterectomy bloodwork. My a1c was 11. I went to an internal medicine doctor and was put on Lantus and a statin. I have cut carbs significantly and have removed all of my once beloved sugary snacks from my diet. I am walking and being more active in general. I'm glad I was diagnosed, but I have been terrified since starting the insulin. I was undiagnosed and out of control for so long. Did I do permanent damage to myself? Am I going to have a stroke at work? Will my blood sugar get too high or too low while I am sleeping? The panic and paranoia are unreal. Did anyone else go through this when you were first diagnosed? What helped you?

Buy a CGM and watch how what you eat affects your glucose. in June 2025, mine was 14.8. I chose Mounjaro instead of the other drugs, because I too had had a hysterectomy and I knew my hormones were really messed up, but I am 66. From the research, I drew the conclusion for myself that the GLP and GLP1 would help my body. My last blood draw in September I was down to 7.6. I cut out all forms of sugar, rice, pasta, bread. I found things that taste good to make, and I honestly don’t feel deprived. I do not buy into the net carb marketing or keto marketing. I look at the carbs and fiber is a bonus. My doctor recommended under 40 carbs a day, at first it was challenging now it’s easy Peasy. Good luck.

Your brain is made up of cholesterol and statins lower cholesterol. I’m NOT telling you to stop taking your meds but it really ticks me off that Drs don’t treat and they just throw meds at you. You can get this under control through diet and exercise IF you want to. I feel like meds should be option 2. Whatever works best for you. For me, I stopped eating carbs and sugar. I went HIGH fiber, HIGH protein and high GOOD fats. My cholesterol is normal and my Dr still wants to put me on a statin. Why? I told her no meds. I will do this myself. If you have the willpower to stick with it, i highly recommend intermittent fasting. Eat breakfast and a big lunch. No snacking. Drink water or tea (unsweetened) of course. The fasting will give your body time to recover and you won’t be spiking 3 times a day or more. I now tend to go low so I carry a protein bar with me at all times and some apple juice. In a month I lost 10 pounds and had no more tingling in my feet. I’m going back for my 3 month A1C check and I’m hoping to be under 7. If you can, after you eat, get up and move. Even if it’s a quick 5-10 minute walk. To me the Drs should give us 2 options Diet and exercise and tell us WHAT to eat OR meds. One or the other. I just think our medical industry has gone so far down the toilet. “Do no harm” has been replaced with “profits over people” younger people are being diagnosed with cancer and diabetes then ever before. Why? Because our food is severely damaged and deficient in nutrients and vitamins. It now takes like 5-7 oranges to get the same amount of vitamins and minerals as 1 orange back in 1970.

At first I was also horrified thinking I’ve permanently hurt my body, that I was going to go through all these things. I purged my whole house of sugar, carbs, you name it. I made as many switches as possible. I lost a lot of weight (twice, because I’ve had a baby in that time) but now I’m just kind of chill like”yeah I’d love to go get Taco Bell”. I realized while I can’t eat that stuff all the time, every once in a while isn’t going to kill me.
4. u/Weekly_Telephone_759 [score=1, created=2025-10-31T17:28:11]: I was diagnosed 15 yrs ago, also by my OB. Do some research, learn what your body does with glucose on a cellular level. Find a doc you can trust, mine is an FNP and I love her. Ask for a CGM. 15 years ago I had to do blood sticks to find out how food, stress and exercise affected my blood sugars. A CGM makes it so much easier. Be ready to make some changes, that’s the hardest thing to accept. My friends back then would ask how long I was going to be on this new “diet.” I couldn’t get them to understand it wasn’t a diet, it was new behavior/habits. Embrace regular dr visits, eye doc visits, dentist visits. This is how you make sure there’s no long term damage. You can do this!
5. u/slowcarbmornings [score=1, created=2025-10-31T03:42:15]: fear hits hard in the beginning. I remember checking my sugar like 10 times a day and googling every weird feeling. it settles down once you see that the insulin is actually keeping you steady, not hurting you. your brain just needs time to catch up to the new normal.
6. u/ChaiTeaLatte13 [score=2, created=2025-10-31T02:54:51]: My a1c was 13.8% at diagnosis in my early 30s. It’s now 5.3%, and I didn’t do any permanent damage that my doctors are aware of! I just focused on eating healthier than I was, and doing an hour of yoga a day! If you haven’t, go get a diabetic eye exam. And make sure you’re going to your doc for a1c checks! I also have never had to use insulin so unfortunately I can’t speak to that aspect
7. u/MadViking-66 [score=1, created=2025-10-30T22:36:19]: In terms of long-term damage, I am no doctor, but I think based on my own experience, the most common long-term effects are neuropathy and damage to your eyes. Neuropathy is something you would already know bothers you if the feeling in your feet is different than it used to be. Damage to your eyes can be easily detected by any eye doctor and treated so it would be good to see an eye doctor sometime soon.

Go one day at a time, don’t overload yourself with things. Every body reacts differently and definitely don’t STRESS cause that brings up your BG. I am still anxious but I know it will take time for things to sync in.. give yourself that time while making lifestyle changes in parallel, that’s what I am doing and hoping for the best.

I think Zeus said most things to start off with. My favorite thing about all this is everyone says don’t stress it makes it worse 😑 lol and Zeus is correct in the fact that everyone is different, I’ve heard of people who can down a bowl of chocolate ice cream and be fine, but one slice of white bread and their monitor goes off the rails. So you will hear a lot of stuff, but please remember this thing effects everyone differently, do what works for you. Keep dialogue with your health team good and open and get at it!!! Don’t let this thing control you! You got this! And we’re all here to help each other!
10. u/Zeus783 [score=3, created=2025-10-30T18:05:40]: Very likely we all went through this phase after being diagnosed.. So panic away, it's normal 🙃 What helped... Knowledge 🤓 Read as much as you can and forums like this are a well of knowledge and inspiration. How much damage it's been caused it's hard to know; the good news is that as soon as you mend your ways and your overall BG goes down so does the chance of getting severe damages from the disease. Will you get a stroke? Unlikely... Your HbA1c is on the high side.. But there's way worse. Don't get paranoid about the many possible ways you could die as if T2 doesn't kill you, stress definitely will. 😉 You need to monitor your BG to have an idea of how t2 affects your BG levels throughout the day/night . No two people are the same. Some have lower levels at night other higher. Once you understand yours you can act on it and learn what works for your specific circumstance to get it right in case levels are out. There are many tricks we all use. I would react same way if I had to take insulin so I hear your pain. Use the fear you feel right now as an incentive to adjust your life style and make life long changes that will allow you to live a long and healthy life and very likely stop taking insulin and any other medication. You will be fine... if you apply yourself that's a certainty 😊
