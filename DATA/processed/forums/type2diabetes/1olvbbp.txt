===============================================================================

I got some neuropathy when I was missing insulin. My shoes were not that tight, but I started to feel the bones hard and went in. I had other issues, outside issues, but this clearly could lead to foot or partial leg amputation.

Once the nerves get irritated, the healing process takes longer, too. Switching to wider, soft-soled shoes can really help protect those pressure points. Has there been any improvement since you changed footwear or started managing the insulin again? Sometimes even small adjustments, like cushioned inserts or seamless socks, make a big difference in comfort and circulation.
