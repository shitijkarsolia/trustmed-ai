2. u/pinkveganympho [score=6, created=2025-11-03T05:53:12]: praying I can get mounjaro one day
3. u/ephcee [score=4, created=2025-11-03T05:18:58]: Yeah, it works so much better than ozempic for me, it’s mind boggling. Imagine the impact this would have had if they found it in time for our grandparents generation?
4. u/Alive_Ad2949 [score=3, created=2025-11-02T20:42:09]: Thanks for reminding me to take my meds
5. u/timdr18 [score=6, created=2025-11-02T15:25:23]: It really is magic. Not only did it completely fix my sugar levels but I’m down 110lbs since the beginning of March. Haven’t been this weight since like Freshman year of high school
6. u/Ischarde [score=2, created=2025-11-02T15:20:02]: Mines is getting there. 1 mg of Ozempic. Almost 2 yrs I guess I'm just very resistant, but finally this is ast free months, the summer really, I'm making tangible progress.
7. u/suprdav2 [score=3, created=2025-11-02T14:35:41]: I was on Ozempic 2mg weekly, and doing great. Until back at the end of June when I got COVID. Then I would get really sick when I'd take my Ozempic shot. Dealt with that for a month, then my Dr took me off and switched me to Mounjaro. Almost at the end of my 2nd 5mg pack.
8. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=1, created=2025-11-02T14:34:24]: Yep it's a miracle
9. u/pastryfiend [score=4, created=2025-11-02T13:35:30]: Yup I was first on Ozempic and then Manjaro both did a fantastic job of controlling my blood sugar and insulin resistance.
10. u/carni-fit [score=3, created=2025-11-02T13:31:10]: What was your A1C when prescribed the mounjaro? Asking because my A1C went from 5.9 to 6.7. My provider says that most likely my insurance will not cover either mounjaro or ozempic because my A1C wasn’t high. And I’ve never been on any diabetes medication before.
