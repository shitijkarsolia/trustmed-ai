===============================================================================

I am on ozempic for type II diabetes but have had some disappointing side effects, my doctor said she has had a lot of success with people switching to Mounjaro but my insurance won’t cover it. I’m planning on switching insurances. I’m wondering if anyone in Washington state has had luck with Premera or regence accepting mounjaro for type II diabetes. Thanks!!
