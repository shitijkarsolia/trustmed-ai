===============================================================================

I plan to switch PCP. I requested a monitor and I am paying $75 out of my HSA. My PCP was negative about me getting one because I’m not on insulin. The nurse told me I lost 4lbs and my blood pressure was down and my PCP didn’t even mention it. I hope this monitor helps me prove to this PCP to quit telling me to exercise more and quit questioning my diet. I shouldn’t have an adversarial goal included in my health journey but I do. This is my after lunch and afternoon snack numbers. Also she upped my blood pressure by 4 times and prescribed me metformin ER. I know there will be people telling me that I’m misreading the situation and I’m cool with all comments. Thank you 😊
