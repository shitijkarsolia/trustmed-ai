===============================================================================

I’m 21 and have had diabetes for about a year now. I just got some labs back and my A1C has gone from a 9.5 to an 10.6. I am just feeling so unmotivated and don’t know what to do. I know it’s something I need to just do to help myself but I’m really struggling on where to even start. My cgm has helped but that only goes so far. If anyone can take the time to talk me through it and give some general advice that would be great.

For instance, take a 15 minute walk during the day then follow it up by doing it again the next day and keep building it so you're doing it for a week. It'll be hard at first but build in that mindsight of just doing a little bit for yourself daily until it becomes a habit. Maybe even get a step counter so you can set a goal of taking so many steps in a day, one of those smart watches has given me a lot of motivation to keep at it and to sustain some type of activity level. After you have introduced some activity for your body start looking at the foods you eat. What is your understanding of a diabetic meal? What do you eat now? What do you think is healthy for you? Make a list of things you feel is healthy for you and we can help explain to you what is healthy for diabetics. I think we've all been through this, we don't get much help when we are diagnosed except to take these meds and maybe get some pamphlets so it takes us quite some time with trial and error to see what is what. Ask us in these forums as we can share our experience with you and help you navigate the seas better.

I swore I was going to pass out and land in the ER. But then I couldn't eat for a day before a medical procedure, and I was fine. I was shocked, but I was fine. My approach has been to eliminate what I call "obvious carbs". For breakfast, I have three strips of turkey bacon with 1/3 cup of generic liquid eggs, like Egg Beaters, scrambled. I lay the eggs on top of the turkey bacon, cover the eggs with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and cover it with a saucepan lid to melt the cheese. Slap it with lots of Tabasco to wake up. For my coffee, I was addicted to International Delight. I replaced it with nutpods French Vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of Allulose powder. And that's it. That's my entire breakfast. No toast. No bagels. Definitely no danish. Around 10:30, I'll have a few tablespoons of homemade Greek yogurt with several halved strawberries, a few tablespoons of Allulose powder (again), and crushed walnuts. For lunch, I have a garden salad with grilled chicken bites added. For dinner, I sprinkle some Paul Prudhomme's Meat Magic on boneless skinless chicken breast and cook it in the Instant Pot. Then I microwave a bag of Steam-in-Bag vegetables, like broccoli and cauliflower. Hit the veggies with butter, hand-cracked black pepper, and a lot of garlic powder. And that's it for dinner. No potatoes. No butter bread. No garlic bread. That's it. For variation, I'll heat up some frozen meatballs on the stove with Rao's Marinara and sprinkle parmigana chesse on top. Not in a roll, no garlic bread. Just five meatballs in a bowl. I hit them with Italian seasoning and lots of garlic powder. I wrote a post several months ago that details how I got hundreds of cookbooks for free from Amazon. I also posted a typical menu that covers me for the month. https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jj61j6/cookbook_hack/ I'm down 65 lbs so far and off all meds. I didn't think it was possible, but I did it. You can, too. You have lots of great tips in the comments.

Exercising can be dancing around your home with fun music playing, to a walk around your block or a hike with friends or a doggo if you have one. Diet is huge, of course, and there can be options for bread/tortillas and the like. I get bagel thins 18 carbs for one, for sandwiches or with cream cheese. Protein, fat and carbs in meals. Nuts, poultry, fish, dairy if you tolerate it. Tuna in the pouches come in tasty options, and I'll add a pouch (14g protein, 2.7oz, 90 calories) to a cup of cottage cheese (love it), sometimes 2 pouches. Walmart has it, Starkist. Sleep is also key and sometimes we don't get enough or adequate sleep. While I do have a script for sleep, it's as needed and one I don't use often. Sleepytime Tea helps me with that. Reach out here, this is a great sub for anything.

You’re young and likely haven’t suffered any of the suffering that results from having let things go for many years…some of which mercilessly are irreversible - crap! The good news is that while the changes needed to correct t2 are significant, they need not be unpleasant. The sooner steps are taken and maintained, the better your body gets over time and even allows for more leniency (treats-wise). Everyone is different and has unique drivers regarding what motivates. Ask yourself: What are yours? Mine are: LOVE of flavor and variety, emotional/ self-soothing eating, Desire for in-restricted quantity until satiety is achieved… that is to say I cannot eat a fixed tiny amount and expect to feel satisfied, Hunger. I found lots of work-arounds and replacements for things I knew I’d miss. I chose super low carb to heal and now eat regular low carb to maintain to gains. I do not and did not use meds. I’m not an active person and am older so this approach took me longer than it would have if I were 21. The results: a1c down to 5.4 from 10.2, lost 65 lb without feeling deprived or hungry, lipid panel is normal for the first time in DECADES, liver is back to healthy, clear head (after lots of brain fog), stable energy, cravings GONE…. Biggest revelation in all this was experiencing the metabolic switch showed me that my eating habits were never about will-power.!!!!They were completely driven by the sugar/glucose dependence of my body chemistry. Once I switched from primarily using sugar for fuel to using primarily fat for fuel- it was so liberating! The cravings and feeling of ravenous hunger just ended. The keys for me were: 1. Break the sugar cycle 2. Get a cgm to see what foods spike me 3. Learn to make low carb versions of the things I love/miss so that I don’t feel the need to stray. 4. Eat the heck out of the low carb/no carb real foods that I already like (for me it’s meat(bacon! Steak), cheese, eggs, salmon, steamed veg with blue cheese or ranch dressing), sugar free jello, strawberries….) 5. Allow/plan for 1 cheat meal per month (meal - not day) Message me if you want to chat :)

7. u/WhitePawedWitch [score=3, created=2025-11-05T15:33:14]: Hi! I was also diagnosed in my 20s. It is so hard. It’s a meal by meal fight. So focus first on protein + fat, then add the smallest amount of carbs that are sustainable for you. I love salmon, so I try and make it a treat and make sure I have loads of veggies and maybe a baby potato or twice baked. I like charcuterie boards that focus on deli then maybe hummus and a few crackers. I buy the low carb bread from Aldi. I buy the low carb tortillas, and just do my best.
8. u/deacc [score=1, created=2025-11-05T14:07:14]: You need to look into your diet. You need to use your CGM to figure out what foods are safe for you and what are not. Also, the amount you are consuming is important. With that, you can adjust your eating habits to your favor. Make sure you walk after each meal, even if it is just for 5-10 minutes. Ideally, you want at least 20 minutes after each meal.
9. u/Complete-Chair8251 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T11:09:10]: I had to look at it like a game or goal. I watch my cgm app and really focused on staying in the safe range. Like someone else said, start paying attention to how foods affect your blood glucose. I am a bit ocd so once I decided I have to stay in range I will do whatever I need to to maintain that goal. For me, bread is the worst. So I started buying keto bread. Pasta and tortillas are also available in low carb versions and that really helps me not feel deprived. The pasta is so good. Tastes the same and my whole family eats it now. Same for the tortillas. The bread is okay but edible. Walking or riding a bike after a meal is so helpful! It will lower my BG even after I've eaten something carb heavy. There's Instagram and TikTok accounts that I found really helpful too. Insulinresisance1 has been a great learning tool for me. He tries different foods and posts how they affect his blood sugar. But remember, everyone different and you need to see how your body reacts! Please do whatever you need to control this. You are so young and take it from an old person, health is everything. You really don't want long-term damage from this disease. Best of luck to you!!
10. u/BusySession1234 [score=4, created=2025-11-05T10:02:44]: Please do not stop fighting the battle. You can do it. Evaluate what goes in your mouth, every bite, then exercise. Prick your finger all day until you figure out what are the bad foods. Take a few bites and test it. Work out everyday doing easy movements and add harder movements but you must exercise. By exercising You are running the sugar out of your body. Take it one hour at a time. You have to know your foods. Stay connected in chats like this. It is helpful.
11. u/Zeus783 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T09:06:03]: Bless.. Let's chip in and try help OP. I have a few questions, if you don't mind, in order to have a better picture.. Obviously this does NOT in any way replace medical advice which you should seek if you need it. I assume you are M? (by the avatar) Hight and weight? Are you active? What does your diet is made of.. And how often do you eat in a day? Sleep? Enough and good quality? What is that you feel you're struggling the most?
12. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T07:26:01]: I have a few questions-Are you on any medications for diabetes? Have you seen your doctor since you got the lab results? Did they give you any guidance in the beginning at all about what you need to do? Does your insurance cover a nutritionist? A diabetes specialist? And does your local hospital offer a diabetes support group?
