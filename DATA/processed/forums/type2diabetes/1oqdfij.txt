===============================================================================

Hi all! I’m going to talk to my endo about this but I figured I’d see what y’all’s opinion was. I’m 23F, 105lbs, 5’8. And boy oh freaking boy am I HUNGRY all the time. The kind of hunger that makes it so you can’t focus and might also make you want to kill someone. HA. Here’s the deal. If I’m going to be fit, I have to eat. Trying to stay active while simultaneously lowering my food options has made me underweight, in pain all the time, and just weak overall. I could barely walk yesterday and I look like a skeleton tbh. Here’s my dilemma. Everything either has sodium, carbs, or fat. Keeping all of those within the suggested limits and staying nourished is impossible. So today, I said fuck it. I don’t want to spike but my sodium is going to go over 2,300. I’m just too hungry. Has anyone else had this issue? How strict are you with your sodium? … I also wasn’t great about my fat intake today. But that I am going to try to be more mindful of.

I no longer care much about fats apart from avoiding partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Nor do I care much about salt/sodium; as I understand it that is only a problem for those who are already hypertensive. I consume both in sensible quantities. In fact, when I initially avoided salt after my diagnosis I suffered severely from increased leg cramps. I care a lot about excessive carbs. My longer opinion on diet is here: [What is a Balanced Diet For a Type 2 Diabetic?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/what-is-balanced-diet-for-type-2.html)

You can also buy no salt added canned goods for your pantry so that you can use them on days you are too busy to cook from scratch For fats, since you are so underweight you can afford to have plenty of calories, just concentrate on good fats rather than saturatedd fats. So for meats, stick with skinless boneless chicken breast and tenderloins, lean pork loin and pork tenderloins and extra lean ground beef. For healthy fats, you can get that from avocado and unsalted nuts. There are plenty of unsalted nuts or mixed nuts (peanuts and cashews are the ones that are most widely available). You can also make your own if there are particular nuts that you preferred. Simply get the raw version (hence they will be unsalted), roast them in a single layer at 350F for 8-10 min and let it cool completely. You can also use no salt alternatives like Dash to season your food. I put my daily sodium limit at 1500mg and I am usually well under. Once awhile I will be over by a little bit but never above 2000mg. Finally, if you like deli meat, Boar's Head makes an excellent no sodium roast turkey. They alos have one for roast beef but I can't find anywhere in my neighborhood that carries them. For naturally high sodium prepared food like smoked ham, start with ones with a reasonable amount of salt. So like 500mg per serving, then soaked the ham overnight then you can cook it for breakfast. If you are doing the whole ham, obviously need longer soaking time and change of water. I buy Dietz and Watson chef carved boneless ham which is lean (so low in saturated fat) and have a good amount of protein and low in sugar.

Eat at a slight surplus of those items to put it back on until you are not a skeleton. Use a TDEE calc online to see how much you need to consume. Then eat towards making those numbers until you reach a place where you are healthy, and not hungry all the time. I am dealing with very similar issues trying not to get too much of anything right now. While I manage my weight back down from around 215 today, to 160-165 where it needs to be between now, and end of March when I see my doctor again. And do it while not coming in with super high lipids/cholesterol, or other things off the charts with the lab she will order and run. One of my key foods for achieving this is tins of sardines, mackerel, salmon, and even chicken and tuna to a lesser degree. Whether I get these in brine (way too salty), or oil (way too oily), I need to rinse all canned items off well with water, even the veggies. This removes a really good amount of both the fat and sodium, leaving me with clean protein/veggies in the form of fish that are naturally oily. A lot of the oil I get comes this way, it is natural and exists within these fish. I drai Last night, I thought i did well. I cooked a pound of hamburger meat, and because it was 80/20 ground chuck, I rinsed it really well under hot water, then used paper towels to remove all of the oil. But I actually pulled out too much fat, and wasn't going to make that number. I had plenty of calories left, and would still be in a deficit (I need to lose weight), so I ate 1T of olive oil to get the necessary fats into me for the day. Those keep you more full, make you a bit stronger, and keep you satisfied, and provide critical lubrication of the digestive track. My system is very sensitive right now from eating like this for the last 6 weeks, and my scale is moving the right way, and my hunger is almost always well controlled allowing me to not snack, and not grab fast food, or other easy to ingest items, and instead focus on clean protein, adequate fat, minimal carbs. This stuff takes practice, you may start, fail, have to get back on, and keep trying till you get your groove. I learned to eat and stay on diet like this much earlier in my life. Back when I was around your age and I was lifting weights a lot, even doing so competitively at one time. Don't give up on things, and it will eventually click into place for you I feel.
