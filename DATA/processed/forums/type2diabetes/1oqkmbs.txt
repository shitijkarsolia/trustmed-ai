===============================================================================

Just venting. I take ozempic 1mg and metformin 500mg twice a day. I honestly don’t take better steps to eating better and I know essentially I’m going down a slippery road, one that my own mom had succumbed to. I hate checking my blood sugars. I’ll get into it for a week and then I stop. I hate the pricking of fingers. I know even at least a few times a week is better than none. I hate how not eating raises blood sugar. Eating raises blood sugar. Like c’mon! Sometimes I can go the day with just eating only one meal, which I know is bad. But it’s annoying. I used to go on walks, but I’ve stopped for a year now. I’ve been dealing with my depression. It’s so so now but there’s just no desire for much. I’m sure there’s some slight role in what I eat contributing to the beetus. Everything is usually connected. Idk. I just wanted to vent. It’s been lonesome these days. You don’t have to say anything. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

I have started using a new lancet every time and lancing the side of my finger instead of the finger tip. Somehow this has helped me mentally. I hope things get better for you.
2. u/lovepunkrock [score=1, created=2025-11-10T21:48:35]: I'm so sorry your having to deal with this! It does suck!!! Maybe try an antidepressant for awhile. This dx is really hard to come to terms with.
3. u/gkelly782 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T21:46:21]: I was stuck in this rut too. K got really depressed in the beginning, feeling like I failed myself. Testing was a daunting task, only felt like I was further cementing the idea that I suck at life. And it’s uncomfortable and inconvenient. I got an OTC stelo and it really changed my perspective on things. My Dr ended up getting me a dexcom script. You’re eligible for one too! We’re on the same meds :) no more finger sticks (unless there’s an emergency)! Checking my blood sugar is no longer a task, but something I enjoy tracking. I’m learning a lot about myself, what foods spike my glucose, how exercise changes things. I also have migraines and I’ve noticed everything correlates. There’s still a lot of work to be done but I finally feel like I’m on the right path. I hope you find peace
4. u/kitamake [score=3, created=2025-11-07T21:21:21]: I got a CGM because I didn’t want to prick my fingers 100 times a day
5. u/GenRN817 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T11:05:03]: Cut out the carbs, exercise and you won’t have to worry.
6. u/SJgunguy24 [score=8, created=2025-11-07T00:09:02]: I agree on the CGM. I moved, and my insurance makes me pay a lot more for rest strips. The CGM's real-time data is way more valuable than finger sticks. Don't get depressed. Look at it as a time to reevaluate things and try a new strategy. Personally, I went dirty keto, then a cleaner keto. Now I'm pretty much a carnivoreish but clean diet. I've never felt better. Walking does wonders for the mind and body. Don't stop fighting. I was on Ozempic for a year and have been off for 16 months. My blood sugars have gotten better, and my body is healing in more ways. I still can't believe what a person can accomplish when faced with a life or death challenge. I watched diabetes destroy my mother's body and mind. I refuse to end up like her. Only you can put in the work. Exercise, carry a backpack with 20lbs in it. It will get easier. My starting weight in 2020 with my type 2 was 380lbs. I'm off all of my meds, blood pressure, metformin, and statins. I'm 205lbs and at 49 in the best shape of my life. You can do it. I believe in you!

Maybe you're not there yet but eventually if we want to survive this we come to that realization. Just know when you do, start a routine, however small, and that it'll make a difference and that you can do it if you want to.
8. u/nativemaverick [score=7, created=2025-11-06T21:39:46]: Would you consider the Abbot Libre sensors? Constant monitoring for 14-15 days
9. u/PiskieW [score=2, created=2025-11-06T21:26:40]: Oh how I hear ya. It's a crock of poop for sure. I honestly thought I was reading about myself. For no reason whatsoever, I'm 69 (F) UK ... up so horridly earlier because ... two kittens 🥺🤗 I take a couple of different pills for my T2, I don't really pay much attention to what I eat, although I do eat fairly healthily. I like bread so I eat it, ensuring I add good butter to help slow down the raising of the sugar. Or at least I think it does 🤷‍♀️ In 2022 I walked masses in training for walking Hadrian's Wall in 2023. Had an awesome time doing that very thing over a 10 day holiday. My BS readings were really good, so I know it helps. Fast forward to now - nothing. Bugger all 🙄 You carry on venting my lovely- we're listening 🤗

Sorry, but testing at your stage is essential. &gt;I hate the pricking of fingers. This might help: [Painless Pricks](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/painless-pricks.html) After you make the decision to take this seriously, this will help you become systematic: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) And no, you won't have to test so much forever: [Do I Really Have to Test so Much?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/im-new-type-2-do-i-really-have-to-test.html)
11. u/tbrando1994 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T21:22:16]: We all have these low moments. Sometimes it’s just normal life…and it can be your hormones making you this way. Just know you are not alone and the only one with these “venting frustration” moments. Sometimes being positive doesn’t feel right, does it? Sometimes it’s nice to vent, get it out and then try to then be brighter the next day. When I have a hard time, I allow myself to sulk for a time limit and then I tell myself to lighten up and laugh and be grateful for what I do have. It’s okay to have these low moments and use them to then get stronger. You will get through it. Look how far you have come so far. Even one little step is better than no steps. See treating your health as taking care of YOU in a good way and not a burden. It is hard but you are doing it. ❤️
