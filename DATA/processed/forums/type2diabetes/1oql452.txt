I seriously feel so so sick. I ate a piece of whole wheat sourdough toast with butter because nothing else is appealing to me. Fingers crossed the nausea goes away asap. When my sugar drops too quick, I feel this way… diabetes sucks. Find me in bed trying to sleep off the nausea!!

Numbers are so hard to control, you eat one thing and it’s okay and then you eat the same the next and it’s not okay. A lot of mornings I get dizzy, nauseous and feel horrible and my specialist says because my numbers aren’t too low or too high then it’s not the diabetes but it 100% is. If I eat carbs in the morning it goes from 5-7.5/8 and I feel horrible, if I don’t eat carbs in the morning it stays around 5 and in an hour I feel horrible and need to eat more. I’m sorry you’re going through this, diabetes is shit!
