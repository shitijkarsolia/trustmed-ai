===============================================================================

Hello! So I was recently diagnosed with type 2, I’ve been put on metformin and I have my first appointment tomorrow to discuss further treatment. I was diagnosed and started metformin 3 days ago but about 2 days ago I started having some pretty nasty back pain. It seems to calm with heat and ibuprofen so I’m hoping that it’s just back pain but I’ve convinced myself I’m in kidney failure or I have diabetic nephropathy, my pain does feel deeper than average back pain and I don’t have a very physically demanding job. I had a elevated white blood cell count and there was elevated protein in my urine. My eGFR was 135 and there was low and the Creatinine in my blood was .65 so I don’t know if I should be worried about kidney issues or not. (I’m a very big hypochondriac and none of this started until I was diagnosed I was only diagnosed because I went in for a headache and they wanted to do a blood test to rule anything else out)

Your symptoms may not be related to your diabetes and should be investigated by your medical advisors. &gt; I was recently diagnosed with type 2 What were your diagnostic blood glucose levels and what are they now? What dietary advice have you received? While you wait for your doctor's appointment I wrote this to help you begin taking control of your diabetes: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.
