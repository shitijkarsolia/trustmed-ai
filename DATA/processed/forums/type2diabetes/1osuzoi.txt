===============================================================================

My previous CGM (Freestyle Libre 2) was giving me inaccurate low readings. I just started a new one and now literally anything I consume is spiking me super high, including things that used to be okay. I had a bowl of Brussels sprouts the other day and had a spike. It’s taking enormous amounts of fast-acting insulin to bring down bc exercise won’t cut it - I was on my bike for 2+ hours last night and every time I stopped pedalling it shot back up. I’ve been taking freezing cold showers bc warm water will spike me. Short of inducing vomiting after I eat if I see a high starting to happen (which I can’t seem to get the hang of) or just swearing off food altogether idk what to do.

3. u/Equivalent-Yoghurt38 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T08:08:49]: Any chance you had COVID recently or got your booster? Both can cause spikes and big drops. If it’s the booster that caused the problem it goes away after a few days, if it’s from COVID can take longer.

He says I should stop watching the spikes and check my daily average. He says that the problem is not the spike, but how long it takes for it to come back down. He is also of the mind that I'm so anxious that it's influencing my readings. At first, I was a bit pissed by his assessment, but since I've changed my focus to the daily average, things are getting better 😀

8. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T14:18:11]: Doing cardio literally will make blood sugar high its not a solution to a bad spike. Are you double checking with a meter?
