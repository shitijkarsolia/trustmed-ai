===============================================================================

Hello. I have not required a GLP-1 yet, but my half sister is being asked to take Mounjaro. I think she would greatly benefit from this (A1C&gt;9) but she over thinks and googles everything. Has anyone had an issue with agstropareais with Mounjaro? Apparently she suffers from it anyway and feels the drug would make it worse. I'm a nurse and I kind of think not, but I want to check with people who actually use the drug.

I'm a bit of a candy ass with meds (I'm just really sensitive) and so instead of ramping up every 2-4 weeks, it was more like 4-6 months with Ozempic and I felt like crap. Switched to Mounjaro and had no issue with 2.5. Started feeling the blah at 5 but it's bearable and it's been a few months
2. u/Mpharns1 [score=3, created=2025-11-11T05:29:10]: I started on a low dose of Munjuro for my T2. Eventually I went up to 10. My A1C has been 5.1 for almost 3 years now because of the Munjuro. I have zero side effects.
3. u/cdfe88 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T19:15:31]: I had gastroparesis with Ozempic, I switched to Monjaro a month ago and I haven't had any adverse reactions
4. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T16:43:23]: What is she doing now to manage the gastropareasis? Has she actually been diagnosed with it? For me, the slower transit time with Mounjaro has caused occasional but very painful constipation, that I mostly manage by eating enough fiber, using MiraLAX and staying hydrated.
5. u/nerdariffic [score=0, created=2025-11-10T16:42:34]: Doc wants me to take ozempic and I refuse. One reason is after talking to a nurse in gastro. For any procedure, they either have to be off it for a while or it's guaranteed intubation to avoid aspiration.
6. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T16:11:40]: Monjaro isn't as bad as the others, but she should talk to her doctor.
7. u/Square-Wing-6273 [score=3, created=2025-11-10T16:07:48]: That's a great question for her doctor, tbh. I am on ozempic and it definitely slows down your digestive system and can cause gastro issues. You have to be careful how much and what you eat. If she already has gastro issues, she should talk to the doctor about alternatives.
