===============================================================================

I was diagnosed on 9/11/25 and was very nervous and scared. Right after being diagnosed I started metformin and then about two weeks later after fighting with insurance, I also started mounjaro. Since the day after my diagnosis I have been checking my blood sugar every morning and eventually started checking in the evening too. I’ve changed my diet a ton and have been doing lots of meal prep. Also seeing a nutritionist every other week. Been walking a bit more than before but admittedly need to incorporate more exercise still. Either way, I am feeling really happy to be seeing some progress!! If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! If you have any good meal prep ideas I am all ears!
