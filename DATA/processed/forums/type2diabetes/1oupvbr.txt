Hi. I am a type 2 60f and am trying to balance my blood sugar. Yesterday I had grec yogourt, raspberries blueberries and a cup ok Keto granola. Overall 13 g of glucides and 13 proteins Then for supper I took 8 shrimps and 1/4 cup of brown rice. 12 glucides and 12 proteins This morning I measured my BS and got 11.4. Grrrrr Today ate toast and 6 cubes of cheese. Glucides 6 and protein 30. Then for supper omelette with onions cheese. So this makes 2 glucides and 24 proteins. I was told that I need to balance glucides. If I eat 9 smarties (little ones) and 4 rolls of rockets, I am adding 33 glucides for a total of 35. Does this make sense? Am I going to have a good BS tomorrow when I get up. I am not willing to do this often but does it make sense. Thanks in advance.

Maybe you are someone who needs to eat 3 meals a day or your blood sugar goes up when you don't eat enough. Plus dawn phenomenon is a thing and it's annoying but I don't know that there's that much that can be done about it successfully unless you want to experiment with different tactics on yourself and find what works for you.
