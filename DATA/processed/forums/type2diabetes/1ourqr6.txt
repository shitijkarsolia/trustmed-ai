===============================================================================

Still getting used to diabetes. Diagnosed January 2024. a1c is 6.0 from 16.9. Yes, I went into DKA, I was undiagnosed. I rarely go below 90. Is something wrong with me? I see posts of people who go low all the time.

But there’s some people on the other side Of the scale. It really just depends :) also congrats on your A1C going down! That’s a huge improvement!

5. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T18:49:58]: Idk it's so different for everyone. I got low every stinking day. Some people never do. 🤷‍♀️
6. u/flarbulation [score=3, created=2025-11-11T18:37:37]: So far in a month of monitoring I have never been below 90. From what I understand, t2d means you don’t go low that much if at all. I do feel bad when I’m in the 90’s and from what I am reading it means that my body is so used to 200+ glucose that a normal amount feels bad.
7. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T18:31:37]: What medications are you on? It’s pretty rare for T2s to go hypoglycemic if they’re not on insulin, though some other medications can do it.
