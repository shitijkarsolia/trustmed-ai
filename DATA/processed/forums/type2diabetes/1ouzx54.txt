===============================================================================

Big Pharma's portrayal of Type 2 Diabetes as a disease of high blood sugar represents a fundamental deception. The true pathology begins at the cellular level, where industrial seed oils systematically corrupt the body's fundamental architecture. For thousands of years, people cooked with natural fats such as tallow, ghee, butter, coconut oil, and olive oil. No human population in history consumed industrial seed oils until roughly 50 to 100 years ago, depending on the country. No amount of bleach is safe to drink. Similarly, Industrial seed oils like canola, soybean, corn, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, grapeseed, and rice bran oil are not real food. These oils are all highly processed industrial products extracted from seeds that were never traditionally used for oil, often using heat, pressure, and chemical solvents like hexane. They are chemical solvents and industrial products that have been deodorized and bleached to appear palatable. Your body has no biological pathway to safely process these unstable, polyunsaturated molecules. When you consume them, they integrate directly into your cell membranes, replacing stable saturated fats. This makes your cells fragile and prone to oxidation, creating a constant state of cellular inflammation. This inflammation is the root cause of virtually all modern disease, from diabetes to heart disease to autoimmune disorders. There is no safe threshold for a substance that corrupts your cellular infrastructure. You would not accept a daily drop of bleach in your water because a small amount is less toxic than a large amount. The poison is in the mechanism, not just the dose. Seed oils act as a slow, cumulative poison that dismantles your health at the cellular level. Every single gram of these oils contributes to the inflammatory burden that overwhelms your liver, damages your mitochondria, and confuses your immune system. The entire notion that these oils can be consumed in moderation is a marketing lie created by the food and pharmaceutical industries. The food industry needs this lie to sell cheap, shelf stable processed garbage. The pharmaceutical industry needs this lie to create the chronically ill patients who will buy statins, metformin, and blood pressure medications for life. Your body does not recognize moderation when the substance itself is a corrupting poison. The only safe amount of seed oil to consume is zero. Industrial seed oils are hidden in most foods because they’re cheap and extend shelf life. They’re used in nearly all packaged or processed items, including chips, crackers, cookies, salad dressings, sauces, and even plant based foods. What many people don’t realize is that most commercial breads, buns, bagels, tortillas, pitas, and pizza dough also contain seed oils to keep them soft and shelf stable. Every restaurants rely on these oils for deep frying and griddle cooking, meaning fries, wings, and sandwiches are soaked in them. In short, unless food is cooked at home with natural fats like butter, ghee, tallow, or olive oil, seed oils are almost impossible to avoid. The mechanism of destruction unfolds in three distinct phases. First, these unstable polyunsaturated fats incorporate themselves into the phospholipid bilayer of every cell membrane. Unlike stable saturated fats that provide structural integrity, seed oils create fragile, oxidized cell walls that cannot properly communicate with insulin. The hormone's signal to open glucose channels becomes distorted, creating cellular insulin resistance. This is not a hormonal deficiency but a structural failure at the most basic level of cellular organization. Simultaneously, these corrupted fats travel to the mitochondria, the cellular power plants. Here they generate overwhelming oxidative stress, damaging the delicate energy production machinery. The mitochondria, in an act of self preservation, downregulate their activity and refuse additional glucose fuel. The rising blood sugar represents intelligent cellular rejection of poisoned energy, not a system malfunction. The liver becomes the third casualty in this process. Overwhelmed by processing these inflammatory oils and their toxic byproducts, the hepatic system becomes fatty and inflamed. A compromised liver cannot properly regulate blood sugar, further cementing the metabolic disorder. The entire system descends into a state of inflammatory chaos directly traceable to seed oil consumption. Pharmaceutical companies have constructed an elaborate facade around this truth. By blaming blood sugar rather than the cellular inflammation causing type 2 diabetes , they created a trillion dollar market for medications that manage symptoms while ignoring the cause. Drugs that force glucose into resistant cells merely accelerate cellular damage while generating side effects that require additional prescriptions. The progression of diabetes follows a predictable pattern of systemic collapse. As cells remain starved of clean energy, tissues begin deteriorating. Nerves suffer damage from glycated proteins, kidneys strain to filter inflammatory waste, and blood vessels develop plaque from the body's desperate attempts to patch oxidized arterial walls with cholesterol. Each complication creates new specialty referrals and drug regimens. The silence connecting industrial seed oils to diabetes is not a medical oversight but a calculated corporate strategy. To acknowledge that these processed oils are the primary driver of metabolic collapse would dismantle the entire profit model. The pharmaceutical and processed food industries share a symbiotic relationship where one creates the sickness and the other sells the management of it. Diabetes represents the perfect perpetual revenue engine for the medical industrial complex. A diagnosis transforms a person into a lifelong customer progressing through an escalating cascade of drug dependencies. It begins with metformin then escalates to thousand dollar monthly injectables like Ozempic before anchoring patients with insulin dependence. The predictable complications then activate secondary revenue streams: statins from cardiologists, dialysis for kidney failure, amputations for neuropathy, and laser surgeries for blindness. Each specialty profits from another piece of the body broken by the unaddressed root cause. This system thrives on managed decline rather than genuine healing. Glucose monitors and test strips create recurring revenue while hospitalizations for diabetic complications generate astronomical bills. The entire apparatus from the agricultural giants producing seed oils to the pharmacists dispensing insulin depends on maintaining this cycle of sickness. The body's ability to heal when provided with stable fats and clean nutrients poses an existential threat to this business model. True health remains elusive not because it is complex or expensive but because it is financially catastrophic for the world's most powerful industries. The body possesses an extraordinary capacity for healing when provided with the correct conditions. Removing seed oils ends the inflammatory assault. Providing ancestral nutrients enables cellular repair. The diabetic state represents not a permanent sentence but a reversible condition once the true root cause is addressed and eliminated.
