===============================================================================

For the past 9 days, I have taken no metformin or insulin, and my blood glucose during the day is mostly below 100 when I check 2 or more hours after meals and at bedtime, but my morning fasting glucose has been consistently around 100-103 for 3 days now. I have not been taking my regular walk in the evenings after meals due to the cold weather. Could that be the reason?

Can you replace it with some light activity indoors due to the cold? Yoga, doing some arm workouts, that sort of thing? But I would be surprised if that’s necessary - 100-103 for fasting on no meds and just in the morning is pretty awesome! (Obviously check with your doctor before taking that as gospel, though :-))
