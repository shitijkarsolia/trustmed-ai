===============================================================================

I’m a 38 year old recently diagnosed t2d, A1C 7.8. I am on metformin 500 mg 2x day. I instantly changed my eating habits which has I think so far been successful. However, lately I am finding myself averse to food. Big time. I shouldn’t complain because I need to lose weight. But I’m concerned about dropping weight too quickly. When I’ve done that in the past I gained it all back and felt terrible. I also have a history of ED. I guess I just want to know if this is a normal metformin side effect, or if I need to be concerned about something else going on. I haven’t had aversions like this since pregnancy (I’m not pregnant). All I can stomach is plain things like chicken breast, mozzarella, bone broth, and green beans. My husband is an incredible cook and I just can’t eat any of his food, even things I used to love! The idea of any spice grosses me out. :( Food aversion isn’t a listed side effect so idk if I should be concerned. ETA: For context I am eating an average of 1000 calories a day for the last 16 days

It has certainly satiated my appetite, I lost 33 lbs over a 15 months period and I think it’s a good thing, I am morbidly obese so it’s not an issue. Metformin is “ off label” for weight loss have a look on Youtube. I went on a cruise holiday with my wife and couldn’t eat the food fully, I had to keep telling waiters it was me not their food which was the issue to keep them happy. 😀

Minimum should probably be 1500, but 1800 would be easier and less restrictive long term. Either way you should talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a nutritionist. When I was first diagnosed I was afraid of all foods to be honest which made it hard for me to eat. There needs to be a balance of awareness and feeling safe in choosing what we put in our bodies. Try to add in a couple of tins of canned sardines for protein and omega 3 fats (there is boneless and skinless varieties if you don’t like the full experience). Some good cost effective brands are bela, season, king Oscar, and wild planet. A tin is about 220 calories on average. Mercury is really low in sardines and other smaller fish too so not as much of a concern.

It could go away over time but if you are concerned call your doctor. That’s just my opinion and my experience with metformin and I’m on 2000 mg a day. Good luck 👍🏻
