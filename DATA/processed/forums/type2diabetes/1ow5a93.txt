===============================================================================

I've been bouncing between being prediabetes and having type 2 for a minute now and I hate myself so much. I hate how I look, and I have a budding insecurity that other people hate what they see too. My a1c jumps around because I'm also battling an eating disorder. But does anyone have positive ways of coping with this? My goto is to just spiral and isolate myself and thats not really healthy.

I tend to be pretty self isolating too, so I do volunteer work (with cats primarily, but also elderly and disabled folks) to help me get out. It makes me feel productive and better about myself too!
