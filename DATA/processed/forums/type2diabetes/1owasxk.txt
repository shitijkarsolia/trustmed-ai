===============================================================================

Hello I’m type 2 diabetic. I don’t rely on insulin but I am tired of poking my finger or forgetting to get more and I’m always running out quick. I want a patch and I want to know if there’s any other type 2 diabetic none insulin patients using a monitoring patch device? I’m paying out of pocket and my doctor said I don’t need one obviously for not being type 1.

A lot of Type 2s use the Libre even without insulin, especially when paying out of pocket. If you try one, sensor patches can help keep it secure. I use the Libre style patch myself and it’s been reliable.

T2, no insulin, but my doctor had no issue prescribing it for me. My old insurance paid for them with no issues, but my new insurance kind of sucks.

The doctors are able to see your numbers and it helps them with their medical decisions. Yes I had to pay a little out of pocket for mine as a Type 2, but they have been so helpful that I don’t even mind.
5. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=1, created=2025-11-13T18:16:16]: Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), like the Libre or Dexcom, aren’t limited to Type 1 diabetes. Many Type 2 patients who aren’t on insulin still use them, especially when they’re trying to understand patterns, avoid surprises, or stay more engaged with their numbers. The tricky part is coverage. Insurance often approves CGMs only for people using insulin, so many Type 2 patients end up paying out of pocket. That’s probably why your doctor said you “don’t need one,” not because it wouldn’t be helpful, but because it isn’t considered medically required by insurance guidelines. Plenty of people in your situation do use a patch monitor, and it can make a huge difference in understanding how meals, exercise, stress, and sleep affect glucose. If you’re planning to self-pay, many people go with the Libre system because it tends to be the most affordable option. It really comes down to what makes your day-to-day easier. Wanting a simpler, less frustrating way to track your numbers is a valid reason, even if you’re not on insulin. If it helps you stay consistent and reduces stress, that’s a meaningful benefit on its own.

8. u/Complete-Chair8251 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T13:19:52]: My insurance covers the freestyle libre 3. I am t2 no insulin. Honestly it's a game changer for me.
9. u/Prudent-Heat-9447 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T13:04:03]: I am type 2, not using insulin, I use a Dexcom one+. Pay out of pocket for it, get 3 months (9 CGM) at a time.
