===============================================================================

I am newly diagnosed and need some help finding options for eating out and take-out. I met with a dietitian and have a meal plan. But I need some ideas on what to get when I need to eat out at a restaurant or get take-out or delivery. Any advise would be appreciated. Thanks!

Like salmon are great again just watch the side dish It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it Good luck!

Burrito bowls hit the spot. You can always find something to eat, but I find sides hard. If they don’t offer a side salad, I’m pretty SOL because sides are all carb city.
