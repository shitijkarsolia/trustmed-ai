National Diabetes Statistics Report

The National Diabetes Statistics Report provides up-to-date information on the prevalence and incidence of diabetes and prediabetes, risk factors for complications, acute and long-term complications, deaths, and costs.

Data in the report can help focus efforts to prevent and control diabetes across the United States. This report is continually updated as data become available. This report fulfills the requirement mandated by the Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act of 2009 (Section 10407 of Public Law 111-148).

Fast Facts on Diabetes

Total:38.4 million people have diabetes (11.6% of the U.S. population)

Diagnosed:29.7 million people, including 29.4 million adults

Undiagnosed:8.7 million people (22.8% of adults with diabetes are undiagnosed)

Total:97.6 million people aged 18 years or older have prediabetes (38.0% of the adult U.S. population)

65 years or older:27.2 million people aged 65 years or older (48.8%) have prediabetes

Prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes

Among the U.S. population overall, crude estimates for 2021 were:

38.4 million people of all ages—or 11.6% of the U.S. population—had diabetes.

38.1 million adults aged 18 years or older—or 14.7% of all U.S. adults—had diabetes (Table 1a; Table 1b).

8.7 million adults aged 18 years or older who met laboratory criteria for diabetes were not aware of or did not report having diabetes (undiagnosed diabetes, Table 1b). This number represents 3.4% of all U.S. adults (Table 1a) and 22.8% of all U.S. adults with diabetes.

The percentage of adults with diabetes increased with age, reaching 29.2% among those aged 65 years or older (Table 1a).

Trends in prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and total diabetes

During 2001–2020, the age-adjusted prevalence of total diabetes significantly increased among adults aged 18 years or older (Figure 1).

Prevalence estimates for total diabetes were 10.3% in 2001–2004 and 13.2% in 2017–2020 (Appendix Table 2).

During this period, the age-adjusted prevalence significantly increased for diagnosed diabetes. No significant change in undiagnosed diabetes prevalence was found (Figure 1;Appendix Table 2).

Prevalence of diagnosed diabetes

Among the U.S. population overall, crude estimates for 2021 were:

29.7 million people of all ages—or 8.9% of the U.S. population—had diagnosed diabetes.

352,000 children and adolescents younger than age 20 years—or 35 per 10,000 U.S. youths—had diagnosed diabetes. This includes 304,000 with type 1 diabetes.

1.7 million adults aged 20 years or older—or 5.7% of all U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes—reported both having type 1 diabetes and using insulin.

3.6 million adults aged 20 years or older—or 12.3% of all U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes—started using insulin within a year of their diagnosis.

Among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older, age-adjusted data for 2019–2021 indicated the following:

For both men and women, prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was highest among American Indian and Alaska Native adults (13.6%), followed by non-Hispanic Black adults (12.1%), adults of Hispanic origin (11.7%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (9.1%) and non-Hispanic White adults (6.9%) (Appendix Table 3).

Prevalence varied significantly by education level, which is an indicator of socioeconomic status. Specifically, 13.1% of adults with less than a high school education had diagnosed diabetes versus 9.1% of those with a high school education and 6.9% of those with more than a high school education (Appendix Table 3).

Adults with family income above 500% of the federal poverty level had the lowest prevalence for both men (6.3%) and women (3.9%) (Appendix Table 3).

For both men and women, prevalence was higher among adults living in nonmetropolitan areas compared to those in metropolitan areas (Figure 2;Appendix Table 3).

Among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older, crude estimates for 2021 were:

1.2 million new cases of diabetes—or 5.9 per 1,000 people—were diagnosed (Table 3).

Compared to adults aged 18 to 44 years, incidence rates of diagnosed diabetes were higher among adults aged 45 to 64 years and those aged 65 years and older (Table 3).

Among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older, age-adjusted data for 2019–2021 indicated:

Compared to non-Hispanic White adults and Asian adults, incidence estimates were higher for non-Hispanic Black adults and Hispanic adults (Appendix Table 4).

Incidence rates of diagnosed diabetes were higher among those with less than high school education and those with high school education only compared to adults with more than high school education (Appendix Table 4).

Incidence was similar among adults living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas (Appendix Table 4).

aPopulation estimates for 2021 were derived from rates for 2019–2021 applied to July 1, 2021 U.S. resident population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau (SeeAppendix B: Detailed Methods).

bRates were calculated using 2021 data only.

Data sources: 2019–2021 National Health Interview Survey and 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data.

Trends in incidence among adults

Among adults aged 18 years or older, the age-adjusted incidence of diagnosed diabetes was similar in 2000 (6.2 per 1,000 adults) and 2021 (5.8 per 1,000 adults). A significant decreasing trend in incidence was detected after 2008 (8.4 per 1,000 adults) through 2021. (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Trends in age-adjusted incidence of diagnosed diabetes among adults aged 18 years or older, United States, 2000–2021

Notes: Data shown are estimated incidence rates (solid blue line) and 95% confidence intervals (shaded). Joinpoint identified in 2008 (seeAppendix B: Detailed Methods and Data Sources). Because of changes to the survey design and survey instruments after 2018, comparisons of the 2000–2018 and 2019–2021 data should be examined with caution.

County-level incidence among adults

Among US adults aged 20 years or older, age-adjusted, county-level data indicated:

Estimates of diagnosed diabetes incidence varied across U.S. counties, ranging from 2.2 to 53.5 per 1,000 people in 2020 (for more detail, seeU.S. Diabetes Surveillance System).

Median county-level incidence of diagnosed diabetes was 9.7 and 9.0 per 1,000 people in 2004 and 2020, respectively (for more detail, seeU.S. Diabetes Surveillance System).

Incidence among children and adolescents

Data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study indicated that, during 2017–2018, the estimated annual number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States included:

18,169 children and adolescents younger than age 20 years with type 1 diabetes.

5,293 children and adolescents aged 10 to 19 years with type 2 diabetes.

Trends in incidence among children and adolescents

Among U.S. children and adolescents aged younger than 20 years, modeled data in Figure 5 showed:

For the period 2002–2018, overall incidence of type 1 diabetes significantly increased.

Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander children and adolescents had the largest significant increases in incidence of type 1 diabetes, followed by Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents.

Non-Hispanic White children and adolescents had the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes across all years.

Among U.S. children and adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, modeled data in Figure 5 showed:

For the entire period 2002–2018, overall incidence of type 2 diabetes significantly increased.

Incidence of type 2 diabetes significantly increased for all racial and ethnic groups, especially Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents.

Non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents had the highest incidence of type 2 diabetes across all years.

Among U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with diagnosed diabetes, crude data for 2017–2020 shown inAppendix Table 11indicated:

39.2% had chronic kidney disease (CKD, stages 1–4), based on the updated 2021 CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).15.7% had moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4).23.1% of non-Hispanic Black adults, 17.2% of non-Hispanic White adults, and 8.9% of Hispanic adults had moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4).32.5% with moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4) were aware of their kidney disease.

15.7% had moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4).

23.1% of non-Hispanic Black adults, 17.2% of non-Hispanic White adults, and 8.9% of Hispanic adults had moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4).

32.5% with moderate to severe CKD (stage 3 or 4) were aware of their kidney disease.

40.9% had chronic kidney disease (CKD, stages 1–4), based on the 2009 CKD-EPI eGFR equation, which included a factor for non-Hispanic Black race.

A total of 61,522 people developed end-stage kidney disease with diabetes as the primary cause.

Crude incidence of end-stage kidney disease with diabetes as the primary cause was 192.7 per 1 million population (61,522 new cases). Adjusted for age group, sex, and racial or ethnic group, the rate was 179.5 per 1 million people.

The proportion of end-stage kidney disease with diabetes listed as the primary cause was 39.2% (307,385 out of 783,594 people). As a result, diabetes was the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, followed by high blood pressure (26.7%), glomerulonephritis (14.6%), and cystic kidney disease (5.0%).

Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 18–64 years.

Among US adults aged 18 years or older with diagnosed diabetes, crude data for 2021 indicated:10.1% (95% CI, 9.6%–11.3%) reported severe vision difficulty or blindness.

10.1% (95% CI, 9.6%–11.3%) reported severe vision difficulty or blindness.

In 2021, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. This finding is based on 103,294 death certificates in which diabetes was listed as the underlying cause of death (crude rate, 31.1 per 100,000 people).

In 2021, there were 399,401 death certificates with diabetes listed as the underlying or contributing cause of death (crude rate, 120.3 per 100,000 people).

The total direct and indirect estimated costs* of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2022 was $413 billion.

Total direct estimated costs of diagnosed diabetes increased from $227 billion in 2012 to $307 billion in 2022 (2022 dollars). Total indirect costs increased from $89 billion to $106 billion in the same period (2022 dollars).

From 2012 to 2022, excess medical costs per person associated with diabetes increased from $10,179 to $12,022 (2022 dollars).

* Direct costs = medical costs; indirect costs = lost productivity from work-related absenteeism, reduced productivity at work and at home, unemployment from chronic disability, and premature mortality.
