Diabetes care at Mayo Clinic
Your Mayo Clinic care team. Mayo Clinic's team of specialists works together to create a treatment plan just for you. Your team may include a health care provider, diabetes educator and registered dietitian. They work closely with you to keep your blood sugar level as close to the target range as possible. Referral and quick access to eye, kidney and foot specialists also is available when needed.
Education. Mayo Clinic offers a thorough educational program for those with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. This program is for those who are receiving an intensive insulin therapy — or multiple daily shot (injection) — program.
This interactive, virtual program is held 60 to 90 minutes per week for four consecutive weeks. The program covers many topics. These include the reasons behind insulin dose adjustment on normal days, during exercise, on sick days and during special circumstances. It also provides thorough information about healthy diets.
Pediatric specialty care. Specialists in pediatric endocrinology treat children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. While receiving care at Mayo Clinic, your child has access to pediatric nurse diabetes educators, pediatric registered dietitians, pediatric registered nurses, pediatric social workers, child psychologists and child-life staff.
Children who are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes may stay in Mayo Eugenio Litta Children's Hospital. This may be to make blood sugar levels stable. The care team can also teach parents and older children how to manage the condition.
