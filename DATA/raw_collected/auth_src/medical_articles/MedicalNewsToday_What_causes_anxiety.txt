Anxiety can arise from various environmental factors, including family dynamics, cultural influences, childhood experiences, and traumatic events.

Life stressors, such as challenging social situations, concerns about gender and sexual identity, experiences of racism, and worries about the environment (“eco-anxiety”), can all contribute to feelings of anxiety.

While genetic and medical factors, as well as recreational drug use, can play a role in anxiety, it is important to distinguish between general feelings of anxiety and anxiety disorders, which require assessment by a mental health professional.

A variety of factors can increase the likelihood of feeling anxious. These factors may be internal, involving genetics, for example, or external, involving racial inequity or ecological concerns.

Feelings of anxiety and anxiety disorders are not the same. Anxiety is an emotion characterized by tension, worried thoughts, and physical characteristics, such as increased blood pressure. An anxiety disorder involves recurring, intrusive thoughts or concerns and other specific criteria that lead to a diagnosis.

This article explores several causes of anxiety.

Environmental factors

A2020 reviewdefines anxiety as “a future-oriented mood state that consists of a complex cognitive, affective, physiological, and behavioral response system associated with preparation for the anticipated events or circumstances perceived as threatening.”

A variety of environmental factors can increase the likelihood of anxiety. For example, a person’s family composition, their cultural and religious upbringing, and many other childhood experiences can influence anxiety levels, according to a2018 review.

Otherstudieshave confirmed links between childhood traumas and an increased likelihood of having anxiety symptoms later in life.

People may feel anxiety as a result of various life stressors. These are not universal and can affect different people in different ways.

Social situations may cause anxiety if a person believes that they might act in a way that could be negatively perceived.

A person might experience anxiety when required to perform publicly or in any situation where there is a real or perceived threat of scrutiny.

The effects of this anxiety can vary. For example, a2014 reviewsuggested that feelings ofsocial anxietymay exacerbatestutteringand lead to a disabling experience for adults who stutter. However, fully understanding the relationship between between social anxiety and stuttering, especially among children and adolescents, will require further research, the study’s authors concluded.

Anxiety, gender, and sexuality

Concerns relating to gender and sexual identities and stigmatization can cause anxiety for many people.

A survey-based2016 studyfound that non-heterosexual respondents were more likely to report feelings of anxiety than heterosexual respondents.In addition, bisexual people may experience anxiety at a higher rate than gay and lesbian people, according to a2015 surveyof students in the northeastern United States. The researchers suggested that exclusion from heterosexual and homosexual social groups may be the underlying cause.

For transgender people,gender dysphoriacan be a cause of anxiety — as can systemic stigma and marginalization.An onlinesample surveyin the U.S., for example, found disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, and overall psychological distress intransgenderrespondents, compared with heterosexual respondents.

Systemic racism leads to psychological distress. TheAmerican Psychological Association (APA)lists socioeconomic deprivation and racial discrimination as two major components of this.

A2014 studyinvestigated the effects of aggressive policing on the mental health of young men in New York City and found an association between increased police contact and higher levels of anxiety. The respondents were aged 18–26 years, and 80% were non-white. On average, they had been stopped by police more than eight times in their lives. Respondents who had been stopped more than five times reported sharp increases in anxiety.

A2015 reviewof studies concerning mental health and race found consistent associations between exposure to discrimination and anxiety, as well as a wide range of other mental health conditions.

Worry about the state of the environment can also cause anxiety, and this is sometimes called “eco-anxiety.” TheAPAdescribes eco-anxiety as “a chronic fear of environmental doom.”Eco-anxiety is not yet a diagnosable condition. While its prevalence is still unknown, a survey-based2018 studyfound that 70% of respondents in the U.S. are worried about climate change, and around 51% feel “helpless” about the current situation.

A range of genetic factors may influence a person’s tendency to feel anxious. These may vary among age groups, demographics, and genders.

However, a2020 analysisfound that general feelings of anxiety are more likely to be caused by environmental than genetic factors.

Many things related to healthcan causeanxiety. For example, anxiety may stem from an underlying medical condition or a side effect of a medication.These factors may not directly cause the changes that characterize specific anxiety disorders, but they can cause situations or require lifestyle adjustments that trigger feelings of anxiety.

Recreational drug usecan causefeelings of anxiety. However, the relationship between drug use and anxiety is complex.

For example, a2018 studyfound links between cocaine self-administration and anxiety-like behavior in rats. Staying with the example ofcocaineuse, otherstudieshave found that anxiety can be both a cause and a consequence of it.

A person who has persistent, severe anxiety may receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. First, a medical professional does a physical assessment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that3.6%of the global population had an anxiety disorder in 2015. This percentage is typically higher among women. In the Americas, as many as 7.7% of women have an anxiety disorder, compared with 3.6% of men, the WHO reports.

There are several anxiety disorders, including general anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. These differ from general feelings of anxiety in their frequency, severity, and impact on the quality of life.

An anxiety disorder can be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions. Before making a diagnosis, a mental health professional reviews a person’s history and performs a detailed assessment. They may also recommend or provide treatment.

Also, a physician may perform a physical exam and order lab tests. This is to rule out other conditions that might be causing the symptoms.

Anxiety is a natural, necessary emotion, and it has many causes, such as stress, fear of negative responses in social situations, environmental concerns, and systemic marginalization.

Anxiety and anxiety disorders are not the same. A mental health professional will take into account the frequency and severity of anxiety and the results of various detailed assessments before diagnosing an anxiety disorder.
