Treatments and Therapies

Statistics and Research

Prediabetes means that your blood glucose, orblood sugar, levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be calleddiabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time.

If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to developtype 2 diabetes,heart disease, andstroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.

What causes prediabetes?

Prediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be:

Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.

Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level

Researchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.

Who is at risk for prediabetes?

About 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who:

Are overweight or haveobesity

Have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes

Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American

Are not physically active

Have health conditions such ashigh blood pressureandhigh cholesterol

Have hadgestational diabetes(diabetes in pregnancy)

Have a history of heart disease or stroke

Havemetabolic syndrome

Havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS)

What are the symptoms of prediabetes?

Most people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms.

Some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.

How is prediabetes diagnosed?

There are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are:

Fasting plasma glucose(FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter):A normal level is 99 or belowPrediabetes is 100 to 125Type 2 diabetes is 126 and above

A normal level is 99 or below

Prediabetes is 100 to 125

Type 2 diabetes is 126 and above

A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. The results of an A1C test are given as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been.A normal level is below 5.7%Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%

A normal level is below 5.7%

Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%

Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%

If I have prediabetes, will I get diabetes?

If you have prediabetes, you may be able to delay orpreventtype 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes:

Losing weight, if you are overweight

Gettingregular physical activity

Following a healthy, reduced-calorie eating plan

In some cases, your health care provider may also recommend takingdiabetes medicines.

Can prediabetes be prevented?

If you are at risk for prediabetes, those same lifestyle changes (losing weight, regular physical activity, and a healthy eating plan) may prevent you from getting it.
