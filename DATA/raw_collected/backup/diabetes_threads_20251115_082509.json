    "selftext": "I have had type 1 since 2006 at 7 years old and have never felt my lows. The lowest I have ever gone was 28, which resulted in me falling and splitting open my lip at 8 years old, which helped me/my family realize I was unable to feel them. Thankfully, the other night, I was able to see myself physically shaking and knew something was up. I was eating a late meal with my partner and could barely hold my fork up with how bad I was shaking. I try very hard to stay within my target zone but have been much more active this week with moving to a new apartment, and it has had my blood sugar all over the place this past week. I am no longer on a pump and use pens to inject/prick my finger to check where I’m at. After this scare, it’s safe to say I finally want to go on a glucose sensor. Has anyone else dropped this low? How did you feel, if so? ",

    "selftext": "This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3\" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. \n\nOn December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, \"What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" I responded, \"Treat my what now?\" And he said, \"Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician.\" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. \n\nMy primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. \n\nI did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. \n\nFor my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. \n\nAfter 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. \n\nWhen I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate \"when I felt hungry\" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. \n\nIn June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. \n\nIn July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. \n\nThis has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. \n\nI hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades. \n\nDose | Duration | A1C | BMI | Start Weight | End Weight | lbs lost | Total Lost | Lost/wk\n----|--------|---|---|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------\n0 | 5 weeks | 10.2 | 40.62 | 325 | 318 | 7 | 7 | 1.3 lb/wk\n2.5 | 4 weeks | --- | 39.74 | 318 | 300 | 18 | 25 | 3.0 lb/wk\n5.0 | 4 weeks | --- | 37.49 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 45 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 4 weeks | 6.2 | 34.62 | 280 | 277 | 3 | 48 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 12 weeks | 5.4 | 32.24 | 277 | 258 | 19 | 67 | 2.28\n10 | 16 weeks | --- | 28.12 | 258 | 225 | 33 | 100 | 2.21",

If it's not in control, then you need to talk to your doctor again, for both advice and maybe more medication. You need to make lifestyle changes if at all possible. Doctor will be helpful for that, but a CGM (if possible, ik they are often expensive) and limiting foods high in carbs and basic sugars are a good place to start. For me, bread and pasta shoots my sugars through the roof, so I avoid them when I can.\n\nSome days WILL be worse then others. Sometimes I'm dumb and have to deal with high sugars for awhile because I really wanted that slice of pizza. You don't need to be perfect, you just need to try to do as good as you can, and to make more good decisions over bad ones.\n\nWish you the best of luck. I was on insulin, but got off it.

He went to a specialized foot doctor today and they said that he probably has Charcot foot. He also has an ulcer on the bottom of his foot. My dad is the only worker in the house and if he can’t work we’re essentially screwed. So the doctor said he needs to rest and stay off his feet and wear a boot. But he works in a factory where he has to constantly stand. He has the ulcer clean and protected under bamdages and he has braces on his feet to help provide some stability. He has some reinforced shoes coming in soon that he can wear to work as well. So with all that said I wish he wouldn’t but I also know there really isn’t a choice. We would use FMLA but we had to use it a year ago for an open heart surgery /and that won’t renew until April 29. So is there any way he can continue on working under the conditions he works with the proper care given to his feet. He can’t wear the boot to work but he can wear it around the house and he can rest all he wants.

I’m not a fan of shit like vegetables, and my entire teenage years has been filled with me just- vegging. \n\nAs a child, I was really, really active. Ballet, Tap, Piano, Girl Scouts, Swim Team, soccer. Not all at once, but I was in at least 2 things, and my weekdays were mostly spent out of the house until after dark. I ate relatively healthily (well- relatively is a strong word) and I was in the correct weight bracket for my age… until COVID hit. \n\nI’d everything but Girl Scouts right before it, just not having motivation anymore. But we still lived in a fairly large house in a safe neighborhood. Then, right around my 13th birthday, we moved. We moved from a large 2 story in a safe, child- filled neighborhood with sidewalks and bikes everywhere, to a 1 story less than a third of the size of our old house, in a neighborhood that despite having a tone of children, has no sidewalks and most everybody parks on the curb, even if there is space in the driveway. It’s not safe to ride bikes or scooters, and hardly safe enough to walk a dog or just take a walk. And again, COVID started up right after we moved, so me and my family were cooped up in this new, small, strange place, all 8 of us (5 people, 3 dogs). \n\nMom stopped going to CrossFit, dad got laid off and went back to his old job as a car salesman. My sister was at a friend’s house all the time, and my brother was moving out to live with his girlfriend. I had no friends to escape to, or hang out with, and my Girl Scout group rarely saw eachother outside of meetings, which happened 2 times a month. I put on a lot of weight VERY quickly, shooting from roughly 100 pounds at 13 to 140 at 14, and it kept increasing. I went from a junior 7 to an adults 12 in less than 4 years, and then from a 12 to a 18 in less than 3. It’s not great, and it’s not healthy. \n\nI know I could have done better. Joined a sport, a club, anything to fix my situation, get myself out of the house, and take more than 600 steps a day for a year. School started up, and those numbers barely changed. I was taking 5000 steps a day, but other than art club (where I was sitting on my ass the whole time), I didn’t really go anywhere. And yet, I found myself happiness, so I figured I was doing something right despite my physical weight. \n\nThen, my doctor got concerned. My A1C was high for my age, and my weight was 220 at only 17 years old. I hadn’t even graduated highschool yet, and my doctor feared the worst for me. She told me I needed to fix things, and I had a mental breakdown in the parking lot. \n\nI tried to change things. My mother and I looked at alternative brands, ingredients. I stopped eating canned chili (used to be my favorite thing) bc the sodium in there was more than a ramen packet. We tried cutting sodas from the house, I tried to go to the gym, or do home exercise videos, and walked more. \n\nBut nothing stuck. Mom and I both had lives to live outside of that. Journey, and it kept getting pushed to the side. Without my mother to guide me, I was lost and unmotivated, and started to hate my body again. \n\nWhat people don’t tell you is that it’s hard to get yourself out of a “potato” stage. For me, my mental health is HEAVILY reliant on my physical health and confidence, and my health and confidence is reliant on my mental health. If one sucks, the other sucks too, and it’s a self pitying, deprecating, awful cycle that I actively try to break. \n\n6 months ago, I went to the doctor and my A1C rose again, making me feel motivated to fix it. And For a while, we did good again! We went to the actual gym, ate well, tracted calories, did everything the internet told us to do, but slowly it happened again. We went to the gym less. “Another day” or “tomorrow” kept being said. I was left home alone or to my devices for dinner more often, and my lazy ass went for the “easy” stuff. Not what was good for me. \n\nAnd then, a little over a week ago. I got the news, that my A1C was 6.7. I was officially in diabetic territory. And I lost it. Sobbed, screamed at myself, threw things, cursed more than I have before. I’m not proud of my reaction, but most 18 year olds would have the same one. And we went to the doctor. \n\nNow, I’m on like- 3 medications to help manage it while I figure out how the fuck I lose my weight, how I reverse what I’d done to myself. I knew I had more risk than others because of my family history, with mom being at risk, and my moms family all having it, but it never really hit me until it well and truly got me, if that makes sense. I don’t know what to do. I try to have a positive mindset, but just looking down at myself ruins my mood. I try to exercise, but it’s hard to when you are surrounded by a mirror at the gym or at home, and I can see how much of a potato I look like. I genuinely have no part of myself I’m proud of. My rolls and stomach are disgusting to me, and I have no way of hiding them, my legs are filled with cellulite, my face is red and splotchy thanks to rosacea BC OF MY DIET ISSUES, my mind is mentally fucked over, and I can’t fix it because my mental health is tied to my physical health and confidence for me. \n\nI’m not trying to pity myself, I know what I did wrong. But if someone out there could give me advice on how you manage it, or anything to help, that’d be… great. ",

        "body": "First, you aren't a bad person and diabetes is not a punishment for poor lifestyle. Is it a contributing factor? yeah. But without the genetic component it wouldn't matter. There are people out there living the exact same life without diabetes because their genes don't have diabetic markers. They will probably have other health concerns but not diabetes. \n\nAsk your doctor about a diabetes education class. I just did one, it was roughly 10 hours. We covered a lot. But the research is updated every year so continuing education is important. This is your health and you shouldn't be guessing. You need to know the risks and the consequences and your best chance at success. \n\nI get that you are mad about this. That is a natural reaction. It's honestly one of the stages of grief. I don't know what will get you to acceptance but you need to do that so you can figure everything out for yourself. \n\nDiabetes is different for everyone. There is no perfect plan that everyone can follow. You have to problem solve and figure out what works for you. The start of problem solving is gathering information. Test your blood sugar and figure out your baseline. \n\nThere are three components to managing diabetes; diet, exercise, and medicine. If you take medicine, it doesn't make you a bad diabetic. It makes you a diabetic using medicine to help control your blood sugar. \n\nThe general rule is 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. Walking is great. So is dance, bike riding, yoga, swimming, etc... You can do 30 minutes for 5 days a week or 50 minutes 3 days a week. I try to do 20 minutes 7 days a week. But I don't do it all at once. I do 5 + minutes 4 times a day.  I was surprised it worked for me. It's easy to fit 5 minutes of walking at work but 10 to 20 minutes would be a distraction from my job. \n\nAlso, drink 64 ounces of plain water every day. Limit your carbs. Like get your burger without the bun sort of stuff. Eat your veggies (non starchy veggies) first to slow down your digestion and eat carbs last. \n\nMost importantly, work with your doctor to figure out what works for you. You have to be deliberately healthy. And the best reason to do it is for yourself.",

I’m going to keep going. \n\nMy only issue is I have these headaches that are like pressure almost and I can’t shake them. I thought it’s because I started eating less so I increased my eating (especially protein and fiber). They go away then they come back and they’re almost nauseating.

Diagnosed by my GP 12 years ago and put on slow and fast acting insulin about 8 months after that by the Endo who the GP referred me to. My GP calls it type 1 so I go with that. This week saw my GP and my Endo on the same day a few hours apart. I see the GP every 3 months and the Endo every 6. So every 3 months I have bloodwork done. My GP has always asked about lows and I tell her they aren't a big issue but as you all know there is going to be some. I have a cgm which alerts me at 4.2, time for me to correct before things get ugly and I manage that very well. For the past year my A1c has been between 5.6 and 5.8 which is a great improvement for me and I credit the cgm\n\nSo my GP says, it's too low, you should strive to get it around 6 or slightly higher. I say, but lower is better isn't it? She's say, ask your Endo and let me know what he says. She also suggested Ozempic and to also ask him. I did so and he says, the lower the better and maybe she is getting fasting mixed up with A1c? No she isn't but anyway he tells me I'm doing great and to keep doing it! As for Ozempic he wasn't thrilled and again says, what you're doing is working so keep it up. Tells me he would prescribe it if I want but he usually only does that for people what can't control things well or if they're over weight of which I'm not too bad. I think I'll pass on it for now. \n\nFor the ones who added Ozempic, how's it working for you? Recommended?",

Quinoa has plenty carbs in it, btw.  1 cup of Quinoa has 39g of carbs which is way over what I allow for a meal.  White rice is 45g.  I will sometimes eat one of those but I just don't each that much.\n\nYou might suggest he wear a CGM for a month or two to track what foods spike him more than others.  He'll most likely have to pay for it out of pocket but it can be super valuable to have a better understanding of what impacts.  His doctor would need to write a prescription for it and then it's probably going to be 120-150 for a month supply (one is good for two weeks).  My wife and I are both T2 and we spike to different foods.  The other thing he might learn is if he eats his protein/fats first the affect on his blood sugar will be less because his body will take longer to process the carbs.  But the CGM will give you good data of what affects *him.*\n\nI would not focus on the BUN or LDL numbers unless the doctor is actually concerned about them.

Even small amounts of exercise help increase insulin sensitivity and open our cells to receive the glucose.\n\nAre those his waking numbers? There are a couple of reasons that your blood sugar can rise while you are sleeping. \n\n1. A \"leaky liver\" which gets signals that your glucose is low in the body and it releases glucose in the bloodstream. A small snack of 15-20g of carbs before bed can actually help with that. Medicine like Metformin can help calm the liver and prevent \"leaking.\"\n\n2. Is called the Dawn Phenomenon, where hormones are released to stress your body into waking up and increase your glucose in the blood. I find that 5 minutes of moderate exercise before bed helps me maintain good blood sugar to the morning and makes my sleep more restful.\n\nSpeaking of sleep, it is very important to get a good nights rest. It helps maintain good blood sugar levels throughout the day. \n\nEat your veggies first. Fiber digests more slowly in the body and if you eat your nonstarchy veggies first it slows down your digestion. Then protein and save carbs for last.

The last 2 times I had to have my husband hold her so I could get it on and she was too scared of me to even come near me for the rest of the night.  Taking it off was just as bad as putting it on.  I don’t know how to put a new one on she has full blown panic attacks if I even touch her receiver at this point, but her blood sugar also tanked today at her friends house and I didn’t know because she doesn’t have a monitor on.  I know when she’s older she will understand how important it is but right now she doesn’t get that I don’t have an option.  I fucking hate this it breaks my heart that she has to deal with this for the rest of her life.",

    "selftext": "I had the Eversense 365 CGM procedure done 16 days ago and the device has been incredible. I went through their PASS program since it wasn’t covered by my insurance which ended being $2400 but if it’s covered by your insurance then it should be $350 plus $200 for the insertion so $550. Cheaper than a year’s worth of CGM supplies. The surgery literally was about 30 seconds and painless. The first 24 hours you don’t calibrate the sensor but the next day you calibrate it 4 times every 2 hours in total 8 hours with a glucose meter which I used the Contour NeXT. After that you calibrate it once a day for 2 weeks preferably within 1-2 hours of the chosen time. Then it becomes once a week for the remainder of the year. The phone app will notify you when to calibrate it.\nThe accuracy is great in my opinion since calibrating it, I’ve been getting glucose meter readings such as 125 and 124 on the sensor. The transmitter will vibrate on your body when you go low and doesn’t have the loud alarm on the Dexcom. You can also go for a run without bringing your phone and it’ll vibrate when you go low which means a lot to me because I don’t bring my phone when I run. Recommend anyone with the means to get it if you want better hypoglycemia detection, comfort, sensitive skin, less waste, and possibly cheaper than CGM supplies. \nTLDR: Recommend the Eversense 365 implant because it’ll last a year, less pain because no filament poking, less waste, cheaper, body vibrations instead of alarm.\nAny questions feel free to ask.",

    "selftext": "I got diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 12.6% in April 2024. I went low carb straight away, started walking and lowered my A1C to 5.6% within 6 months. I have been low carb, except a few days like christmas or birthdays where I had the occassional slice of cake or some potatoes/bread. Everytime I had carbs alone, I spiked hard like in the 200s. My doctor, however, has always been insistent that I need to eat carbs. Her guideline that she gave me has examples like 2 breadrolls or 3 potatoes or 1 cup of rice for lunch. Everytime I have eaten rice, I have spiked. So I have stayed low carb for over a year.\n\nIn my last appointment in August, my A1C was at 5.7, so borderline again, but I expected that since I was in bedrest for 2 months due to an ankle fracture. She was again very insistent that I eat more carbs and if carbs spike me so much then she could increase my medication. I take metformin 500 mg once a day and I really don't want more meds. I can barely remember to take that one pill everyday.\n\nSo I thought, fuck it, I'm going to eat more carbs and when the next blood test happens the results will show her why I'm low carb. I ate *almost unrestricted* for the last three months. I ate rice, not daily but definitely more than before, I had bread regularly, I ate croissants and puff pastries for breakfast twice a week or so, I ate chocolates, snacked on chips in bed, I even had cakes and ice cream. I also finished a whole pack of Spekulatius biscuits within a week a couple weeks ago (these are full of sugar and just eating 5 spiked me to 240). I knew I was damaging my body but I wanted to prove a point really.\n\nMy blood test was on Tuesday and I just got my results. My A1C is at 5.5% and my Cholesterol has improved. I am reeling with confusion. What the fuck happened?",

    "selftext": "After years of awful doctors I went through, who wouldn't listen to my struggle with diabetes. I finally got an endo who diagnosed me with Type 1.5, over type 1. In my early 20s I struggled so hard on keeping my blood sugar leveled, until I was 23 and had my sugars go over 400 night after night, until about new years before I turned 24, where I switched full time to a keto diet.\n\nIve been on a keto diet for almost 5 years now, but my last appointment with my new endo prescribed me metformin again (I was taken off it entirely bc I was told it wouldnt work when I was 20, even tho I kept telling my previous endo I had insulin resistance issues and he wouldn't help me with type 2 meds in the slightest).\n\nAnywho, within the past couple years, it's become increasingly difficult to sustain being on keto anymore. I haven't taken my metformin that I was prescribed in september, mostly because \n\n1. too scared to try it yet\n\n2. I wanna build up a supply of metformin before I start\n\n3. In the past couple months I was able to consistently keep my sugars below 200 majority of the time.\n\nI wanna transition out of keto so bad. I have to eat a lot of food, especially meat, because Ill get severe hunger pangs if I don't. To the point that I believe it's affecting my blood pressure negatively. I have to eat a lot of salt, so I don't get those low blood pressure symptoms. And I think now I'm starting to have my blood pressure go from high to low, a lot.\n\nHere's some points about my current medical situation\n\n1. Im on an insulin pump (endo wants to try out me with my insulin pump on with 0.9 hourly basal)\n\n2. I was prescribed 500mg slow-release metformin pills that Im supposed to take once a day.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if I have to take it really slow.",

I also know farxiga can have other protective benefits, but also that any meds come with risks. \n\nSo, how did yall decide to try life sans meds, or why do yall continue meds?

It hit me one day with a flu like illness where my son brought me to the E R with sugar of over 600 - you are now diabetic - work on your log, keep your aic and glucose low and try everything - every person is different, keto helps most, vegan helps others you have to find your path, omad helps me that knowledge comes after years of trying different diets, when not on omad the Mediterranean diet worked for me.  Instead of a second opinion, focus on what works for you.  Cheat days are okay but remember to balance it and keep hydrated your meds are flushing sugars into your bladder/liver etc so fluid keeps that system flowing.  Good luck!",

Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia. \nIn October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.",

In India these programs run cheap and rely mostly on coaches. In the US the successful ones (Virta, Omada, Livongo, Signos, Lark Health) work because they plug directly into insurance and employer health plans. The money doesn’t really come from the patient, it comes from insurers reimbursing remote monitoring, telehealth, and diabetes-care codes.\n\nIn the US you need actual clinicians, not just coaches, to adjust meds, monitor CGM data, and bill Medicare/insurance. You also need HIPAA compliance, FDA-safe workflows, and state-licensed telehealth. The upside is much higher revenue: US companies can bill around 1500 to 3500 dollars a year per patient, plus recurring monthly reimbursement for remote monitoring. The downside is higher acquisition cost, higher regulation, and more complexity. I hope that answers your quest, or it may be irrelevant.  I just took a chance.",

Obviously pizza, pastries, crisps are off the table for now. I eat stir fried veg, fish, meat, quark (like Greek yogurt), eggs, cheese, spinach, and I eat chia seed pudding in the mornings (chia seeds, Stevia, cinnamon powder, milk, and almond extract - mix leave in fridge for a couple of hours or overnight). I occasionally eat wholemeal bread - eggs on toast. I switched to Stevia instead of sugar. \n\nThe solution will be a combination of drugs (everyone gets Metformin but there are others too they are all good) and diet and exercise if you can, just walking after meals helps the post meal spike. \n\nReducing saturated fats in my diet was really helpful. \n\nI use an app loseit to track nutrients. It's immensely helpful I aim for \n\nCarbs - less than 130 grams per day\nSat fats - less than 20 grams per day \nFibre - at least 30 grams per day (fibre doesn't convert to blood sugar hence chia seeds 90% fibre - they expand so not dry). Hemp hearts are incredible and full of healthy fat and go well with yoghurt or quark. \n\nWhen your blood sugar levels are back under control you can reintroduce carbs back into your diet, type 2 diabetics can eat mostly everything in small quantities. \n\nIf you are a habitual snacker or sweet eater you are likely to crave and thats okay just make the distance between snacking longer and longer each time. \n\nYou probably didn't want war &amp; peace just wanted to say I've been there and it gets better",

It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Heck, not even a marathon: it’s literally the rest of your life. There’s room to mess things up in the beginning before you get them sorted out!\n\nThird: enjoy your birthday! You’re going to make long term changes and get everything under control, and no single day or single meal is going to kill you. That’s the advantage of type 2 over type 1, to be fair: left unmanaged, T2 makes for a horrible death, but thankfully, it takes a long time to get there, and the fact that you’re here in this group, asking for help, so soon after diagnosis, that’s a really good indicator that you’re not going to be going out that way.\n\nOne of my favorite statistics that I’ve read on this journey is that people with t2 who manage it, and keep their glucose under control, actually live longer lives than the general population. So if you want to, you can get this wrapped up and under control and be just fine. \n\nLast thing, the time frame: the first few weeks are rough and it’s totally ok to go through all the emotions, and shame, and grief or whatever. Then you’ll take a few months to get your best practices in line and under control. By about six months, you’ll see positive results and start testing better and feeling better, and the whole exercise becomes easier and you get more confident about things. So: hang in there. Don’t panic. Keep reading this sub. All the answers are here! And good luck.",

Of course there's A LOT of room for improvement but hey.

    "selftext": "I'll keep this as short as possible. I am 35 and was diagnosed with T1 in my mid-20s. I maintained pretty good control for many years, with my A1C bouncing between 5 and 6. I went off the rails a couple of years ago after developing severe anxiety over hypos (specifically one that occurred just after a basal injection, which mortified me) and as a result, began letting my BG run far too high. I finally started seeing a therapist a few months ago to deal with this and have gotten less afraid of taking my insulin and been more aggressive. Two months ago my A1C was nearly 15 (yeah, *I know*) but I have since brought it down to 10 and am continuing to make progress.\n\nIn the last week,, I have begun experiencing pretty noticeable numbness in my feet (specifically around my big toe, especially on my left foot) and tingling/pins-and-needles/burning sensations. When my BG was at its worst, I had occasional foot irritation but not this level of sensations, specifically the numbness. It really alarmed me because it seemed to come out of nowhere and I know that my A1C is going in the right direction.\n\nI did some reading and it appears that some people experience something known as \"treatment-induced diabetic neuropathy\" which comes on when A1C levels are lowered more than 2-3% in a relatively short timespan. I suspect this is what I am experiencing as it seems to make sense with the timing of things. What scares me is that in many people's accounts of this phenomenon, they describe it as becoming unbearably painful and I fear that as my BG improves, the pain/numbness is going to get much worse. I read that the suggestion for avoiding TIND is to lower the A1C gradually (i.e. around 2% every three months or so), but at that rate it would take me far longer than I'd like to bring things back to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nI am seeing a diabetes educator this week to help further get myself on track and am wondering if they may be a good resource to talk about this. I see my endocrinologist again in a little less than two months. Based on the timing and progress, I cannot help but think that TIND is what I am experiencing. Strangely, I'd never heard of it before, nor has my endocrinologist ever mentioned it. I am curious if anyone else here has experienced this and has any insight or stories. As I said, it seemed to come on out of nowhere and it frankly really freaked me out.",

No feet issues at all yet.\n\nMade immediate changes to diet- heavily cut back on carbs, quit all sugary foods, drinks etc., started taking metformin (and later long-acting insulin)\n\nMay- about 5-6 weeks after diagnosis, seeing improvement with my BS, but neuropathy kicks in with my feet. Quickly gets so bad at night that I can't sleep anymore, feet feel like they're on FIRE. Doctor writes a prescription for gabapentin, which helps significantly and allows me to sleep/function again.\n\nOctober- A1C is down to 4.7 six months after diagnosis.

Eat it once, take your normal amount of insulin and write down your numbers before, and every 30 minutes throughout for the next 4 hours. Also include your activity level. \n\nIf you spike into the 200s and have relatively low activity, try it again with a single variable change -- either be more active or take more insulin, write it down again.\n\nTry it at least half a dozen times. Your goal is to get incremental changes that are better, not bomb your sugar levels. \n\nYou'll get better at guestimating what you need, when, and how long it'll take.

The pump was fine but the sensor was so bad it was not usable. 5 years ago I switched to omnipod dash and dexcom g6 and it was great. Now my doctor wants me to switch to 780g. I'm excited about the new pump but that means I would need to use the guardian again. Last time I had guardian sensor it lost connection all the time and often gave inaccurate readings. It is also really difficult to put on by yourself. I have grown from a teenager to a young adult in the time I have used dexcom so I'm hoping the guardian will work better for me now. I would really appreciate your experiences and possible tips living with the guardian sensor. I'm also a swimmer so would like to hear about swimming with the guardian.

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 3 years ago. It sucks, basically, I eat really really healthy now. I've lost over 50 pounds in the last 3 years and am in the best shape of my life. But eating healthy is soooo boring. I don't cheat because I don't want to die. I've tried some of the diabetic Ice creams out there and they kind of suck. Like so much that after a few bites, I've thrown the whole container away. I'd given up on ever having ice cream or anything like it again. \n\nBut I do regularly eat the no sugar added yogurt with some protein powder and other supplements all mixed in with a few berries. This has been my go to first meal of he day for some time.   \nMy wife saw a commercial the other day about a new ice cream maker the Shark Ninja CREAMi Swirl and how it can turn just about anything into ice cream or soft serve. She bought the machine last week and took my daily yogurt and just froze it. The next night she put it in the Ninja Swirl and made soft serve frozen yogurt for me. OMG, it was better frozen! So good, healthy, safe, no spikes, just good old fashioned frozen yogurt like I use to buy at the ice cream shops. Now I'm making all sorts of different flavors and concoctions. \n\nIt is super easy to do and clean up, I think to make a batch it takes a few minutes, and to clean up you just rinse it and the pint bowl in the dishwasher. If anyone loves icecream like I do, I'd suggest you try something similar. Has given me a new viable dessert option and when you are a diabetic, any new safe food option that you actually enjoy and look forward to is amazing! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdhri3fyvn0g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28725bcf03092235346d8bc2cce98e98f49cc7c6\n\n",

Older men with long-standing diabetes often have low testosterone and poor nutrient absorption, which can cause rapid muscle loss.\n\nMany diabetics undereat protein out of fear of raising glucose. But protein minimally affects blood sugar and helps protect lean mass. Aim for 1.2–1.6 g per kg body weight daily, from sources like eggs, poultry, fish, whey isolate, Greek yogurt, tofu, etc.\n\nWhey isolate in particular is quick-digesting and shown to improve glucose control and muscle recovery when paired with resistance exercise.\n\nEven 15–20 minutes a few times per week makes a big difference. Bodyweight exercises or resistance bands can help reactivate muscle growth, improve insulin sensitivity, and stabilize blood sugar.\n\nAs for supplements etc.\n\n* **Magnesium glycinate or citrate** – supports insulin signaling\n* **Creatine monohydrate (3 g/day)** – safe for most people with normal kidney function and helps preserve strength.  Any company that sells CreaPure certified. eg. NutriCost, which has both certified &amp; non-certified.  Choose CreaPure.\n* **Omega-3 (krill oil)** – anti-inflammatory and supports muscle protein synthesis.  Krill Oil gets absorbed much better than fish oils.\n* **Vitamin D3 + K2** – helps muscle and bone strength\n* **HMB (β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate)** This is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that directly reduces muscle protein breakdown. It’s one of the few supplements with strong evidence in older adults and people losing muscle from inactivity or chronic disease. Typical dose: **3 g per day**, split in two or three doses. It’s safe, doesn’t affect glucose, and works best when combined with light resistance training and adequate protein intake. I use NatureBell (Amazon)\n* **L-Glutamine** Glutamine is conditionally essential during illness or metabolic stress, and diabetics often have lower plasma glutamine levels. It helps maintain intestinal integrity, supports immune function, and can modestly aid recovery after workouts. However, for pure muscle-building purposes, it’s not as potent as HMB or creatine. Think of it more as a “recovery and gut health” amino acid. Typical dose: **5–10 g once or twice daily**, ideally between meals or post-workout. I use MicroIngredients (Amazon)\n\nIf his kidney function is normal, HMB, L\\_Glutamine &amp; Creatine can be used safely — but HMB will have the most direct effect on preventing further muscle loss, while glutamine helps overall recovery and glucose stability under stress.",

It usually takes a few days for things to start normalizing.\n\nThe problem is there’s so much misinformation out there. Everyone focuses on carbs and blood sugar spikes, but few realize that fat plays a big role too. Sure, fat doesn’t directly raise blood sugar, but saturated fat can make your body more insulin resistant, which is what leads to those stubborn numbers. Hepatic insulin resistance is the main reason for Dawn phenomenon.\n\nYou should also consider adding resistance training.

My gyno about idk 3 years ago said I had insulin resistance with some testing she had done and started me on keto. I went from 125-105lbs and we started me slowly introducing carbs and what not in. She ended up leaving the area and after about 1.5 years of keto i started to go back to normal ways. About 2 weeks ago we did labs with my rheumatologist and one was a glucose which the level was 58. I wasnt fasting i had ate a sandwhich and some chips as i have morning meds to take. Labs were at 130pm. Well today i have an appointment with the rheumatologist to go over labs and basic follow up appointment stuff. I also have lupus POTS fibromyalgia..I had asked about the lab and he said it was a fluke and im to young to have diabetes. Wondering if anyone else has been told this? For me it was alarming to have a blood sugar of 58 knowing I wasn't fasting that day either. He wasn't concerned brushed it off like they do.. I feel like its something I want to look into because my dad and his sister both have type 2 diabetes. Just looking for some general advice or input? Should I ask my primary here in town? Rheumatologist is 2 hours away and we did a video appointment for this one. Just feel defeated. I understand it isn't a huge deal but it was a little bit for me.

When it's connected to diabetes, what happens is your blood sugar goes too high right after eating and then crashes down a couple hours later. This can happen because the body senses it's not responding to the high blood sugar and then pumps out all the insulin it can, and then the insulin kicks in and causes the blood sugar to drop too much. This can happen because of LADA (slow onset type 1 in adults) or fluctuating insulin resistance (ie you did some exercise after eating that lowered your insulin resistance so all the insulin your body was pumping out could suddenly work effectively). You can pick up a blood glucose meter over the counter at the pharmacy/drug store to check your own blood sugar throughout the day if you are concerned, then bring those numbers to your primary doctor.",

If you have your last meal at 8pm and then your next one at 6/7/8am, that is all the fasting your body needs.\n\n\nI'd suggest you go back to a more normal regiment of eating (3-4 meals a day) and control your BG via good food choices and regular exercise if possible. If not, it might be worth thinking about medication. While it is great if you can control diabetes via dietary choices/changes, these shouldn't be so extreme as to cause additional issues.\n\n\nHowever it is important to keep in mind something else entirely could be causing your current issues.\n\n\nBest of luck!",

Been pre-diabetic forever.  Male, 50’s, 6’, 350.  Started a new glucose monitor.  If I don’t eat for 12 hours it will go down to about 180.  I’m incredibly shaky at that point.  As soon as I eat something with carbs it will shoot right up to 350 or even higher.  It’s so high that my monitor tops out at 350 and flatlines on the graph.  I’m not eating too crazy just like 2 hamburgers or some slices of pizza or even a baked potato.  They just started me on insulin twice a day and they said 8 units but I bumped it up to 10.  I’m always exhausted.  As soon as my glucose gets close to 350 I become even more exhausted and have to go right to bed.  I’m spending up to 20 hours a day in bed just getting up to use the bathroom and eat and then repeating the process.  The only time my glucose did not shoot up was when I cooked and ate plain chicken thighs.  I didn’t like eating all meat though so was still hungry.  I know I need to buy low carb but I have been eating up the carb food I have on hand before I start low carb mode.  Any tips for me?  I’ve been watching videos of foods to buy and eat but they don’t sound very satisfying.  I’m disabled with my back and need easy to eat quick meals I can have on hand to eat before I pass out.  I have a new Endocrinologist and Dietician but I’ve only met with each once and then once a month appointments scheduled.",

        "body": "Wow that's a lot to unpack here.  For starters, burghers &amp; pizzas etc are only going to make things worse.  When you have insulin resistance, anything that is processed or things like potatoes will spike.  When you consume saturated fats from hamburgers, bacon etc.  the fat from it creates insulin resistance in your liver.  So you will see high fasting glucose.  Also, this fat clogs up your muscles and prevents it from absorbing the glucose leading to muscular insulin resistance.  These are very simplified versions of what is actually happening. \n\nYou need to chose lean meats with as low saturated fats as possible. Even dairy like cheese etc, you can start by choosing low fat versions.  The more you avoid these things, the better it is.  I would eat chicken, fish of any kind, some eggs like not more than 3, plenty of veggies etc.  I know you said you are disabled but you can do resistance training and star with focus on your biceps, triceps, chest.  There are also back friendly leg exercises you can pickup.  Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat  &amp; improves metabolism. Also, some light 30 minute cardio in the morning on an empty stomach &amp; walking for 30 minutes after your meal will help immensely.\n\nTo make your life easy, look into getting an Instant Pot &amp; an Air fryer. \n\nYou can not tackle this with diet alone, you have to do a lifestyle change to include exercises to build muscles &amp; burn fat.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.",

Also I’ve been replacing sweet treats with keto (no sugar diet) options so look for those products to satisfy that need. But I highly recommend you to avoid burgers and pizza (at least until you have normal levels of glucose) because it’s very bad for this condition.

(there are some good sugar free ones though)\nVeggies need to be relatively low carb. A good general rule for veggies is if it grows above ground it’s usually ok to eat (there are exceptions, like corn, corn won’t do you any favors). \nLook up easy low carb or keto foods, SLOWLY introduce carbs back in (but only a small amount and only one thing at a time to see how your body reacts, the CGM is going to be a huge help with this). Even if you get spikes, it’s ok, spikes are normal even for nondiabetics, as long as the spike goes down sub 140 after 1 hour that spike is fine and normal. I understand that right now you may not ever be 140 so just… as long as it goes back down to wherever you started within 60 minutes of the spike you’re on the right track. Eventually your baseline will lower, but it takes time and work. You can do this, but get rid of the Carby foods. Donate them (sell them to a family member/friend if you have to lol) and get better food for you. \nYou know the food pyramid? This doesn’t really apply to you anymore. Try to focus on how you plate your food, go for 1/4 (give or take) lean protein (don’t forget to season!) and the 3/4 of your plate be low carb veggies. If you HAVE to have a carb right now, do it, but severely limit it until you get your baseline to something normal. By limit I mean really limit, 1-2 bites of ice cream MAX, 1/2 a small roll, a single very very small potato. But honestly until you can get that baseline down I’d avoid carbs as much as possible - reintroduce them slowly once you’re out of “I-feel-like-shitsville” 24/7.",

I understand you don't want to waste the food you have, but it's going to be that much more difficult adjusting to a low/er carb diet if you're eating nothing BUT carbs and processed food right now. Mix the high carb food with lower carb sides as you play with recipes and figure out what alternatives work for you. \n\nA fasting reading of 180 is pretty high - that's actually the peak/highest reading most endocrinologists want diabetics to see post-meal. Ideally you'd want a fasting reading between 80-100, but it may take time and effort to get there because you don't want too drastic of a drop - you may feel a false low/hypo as your levels drop because your body isn't used to what that feels like. A reading of 350+ is high and there's too much sugar in your system, which is why you feel tired/sleepy. \n\nI'm not sure where you're located, but (I'm in the US) there are some affordable low carb meals to make. Some require meal prep, or waiting for sales on certain products and stocking up if you can. In the summer I eat a lot of salads, topped with protein (usually frozen chicken strips); now that it's getting colder I'll make soup at home. Healthy Choice has low carb steamed frozen meals that are actually pretty decent; sometimes I'll add extra veggies like broccoli or bell peppers. Frozen veggies are just as good as fresh produce, and worth it if you don't get through produce before it spoils.\n\nIf you can start working in daily movement, that will also help with managing your blood sugar levels, especially after meals. Walk in place/pace around your home if walking outside isn't safe, and aim to increase how long you move every day/week. If mobility is an issue, maybe movements/exercises you can do while seated/laying down.",

You can have bad days, but whatever you did to avoid medication and lower your a1c, get used to it because it's what you'll need to do for the rest of your life. That's why it pisses me off so much when people say that it's the \"good\" type of diabetes. It's not. None of them are. Management takes complete dedication. There is no such thing as reversal of diabetes, only remission, which is also rare and difficult. The longer you go with high blood sugars, the more damage is done to your pancreas and eventually, it doesn't come back from that and you'll require insulin. \n\nLong story short: Getting your a1c down to 6 is incredible. You should be proud of yourself. Keeping it there will take a lot of work. There is no magic cure, no quick fix, etc. The fad diets are not sustainable. It's not impossible. You will have times when you slip up. But as long as you continue working on your health, you'll be okay. You need to prioritize your health. If you want to have a burger, have it, but pair it with a walk after you eat it. If you want ice cream, eat it, but add some protein beforehand and a short walk. This has to be your priority. \n\nA1c and time in range numbers don't lie.",

Basically your liver pumping out glucose but the baqsimi multiples this effect many times. \n\nSo get check out by a doc after using glucagon. The stores in the liver might not be replenished yet (again this is one of the processes affected by type 1 anyway so we don’t know how long until things are back to normal ish in top of using glucagon).  \n\nHope you’re on the mend and glad you had glucagon with you as you felt yourself passing out.",

Being affected by the summer heat my blood sugar was dropping fast in less than 1h 30. Being already full I tried not to panick and I tried correcting it with a juice box and some biscuits. After 20 minutes it was still dropping fast, I was already at 60 mg/dL still double arrows down and because it was simply too much food I threw up. Then I took a baqsimi.\n\nI immediately regretted it because I felt a horrible cranial pressure, my nostril was burning really bad and I had heart palpitations too. I don't have any medical problems with my heart. It was only a side effect of baqsimi. The heart palpitations stopped after 10-15 minutes but the cranial pressure lasted for about 7 hours. It was so bad I couldn't even keep my head straight. Fortunately, because I didn't have any food left in my stomach after I threw up, my blood sugar came up slowly and it reached a maximum of 334 mg/dL in about 3 hours. And although it wasn't an ideal outcome, it came back in range slowly but steady.\n\nSo personally I would recommend to take nothing similar to baqsimi and instead take a glucagon injection. To have a headache is bad, but to feel dizzy and then to have these horrible side effects and being panicked at the same time is worse. Never experienced such thing with glucagon injections in my 23 years of type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately glucagon injections aren't available in my country anymore.",

Happy to say I am down to 6.4 and feel great! Our goal was to get me to 6.9 just to show I can bring my A1C down and I got my results today! Proud of myself and now I’m not motivated and confident that I can take control!!",

It seems like a good idea, and I was curious if any of you folks have any experience/advice.  (Yes, I do use probiotics and fiber, yes I've been checked for other issues.

    "selftext": "This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3\" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. \n\nOn December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, \"What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" I responded, \"Treat my what now?\" And he said, \"Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician.\" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. \n\nMy primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. \n\nI did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. \n\nFor my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. \n\nAfter 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. \n\nWhen I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate \"when I felt hungry\" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. \n\nIn June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. \n\nIn July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. \n\nThis has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. \n\nI hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades. \n\nDose | Duration | A1C | BMI | Start Weight | End Weight | lbs lost | Total Lost | Lost/wk\n----|--------|---|---|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------\n0 | 5 weeks | 10.2 | 40.62 | 325 | 318 | 7 | 7 | 1.3 lb/wk\n2.5 | 4 weeks | --- | 39.74 | 318 | 300 | 18 | 25 | 3.0 lb/wk\n5.0 | 4 weeks | --- | 37.49 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 45 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 4 weeks | 6.2 | 34.62 | 280 | 277 | 3 | 48 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 12 weeks | 5.4 | 32.24 | 277 | 258 | 19 | 67 | 2.28\n10 | 16 weeks | --- | 28.12 | 258 | 225 | 33 | 100 | 2.21",

I’m only a year younger than your dad, and I cannot imagine relying on my children to manage my health unless my husband I were incapacitated.

That requires him to accept that he has diabetes, make the doctor’s appointment, and follow through.\n\nIf he won’t do these things, and especially if he’s low-key implying his health is your job, you have to drop the rope (unless he is incapacitated). You have to say “Dad, these are numbers that will likely cause you to lose your sight and possibly a foot if you don’t go to the doctor. I can’t help you if you won’t help yourself.”\n\nI’m being deliberate in mentioning blindness and loss of limbs. Many diabetics in denial will have a mentality of “so what, I’ll die on my terms” (black and white thinking). Reminding them that it’s not a straight line but they actually are likely to live, blind and without feet, can sometimes shake the denial. (The logic: once someone is treated for blindness/foot issues, they are finally treated for diabetes.)\n\nAnd even then, he might still choose to sail the River Denial. You have to let him.

Testing can also help keep you accountable.

If you eat pasta, for example, try to keep it to 1/4 of your plate. Fill another quarter with protein, such as baked fish. Fill half the plate with vegetables. Don’t go back for seconds, or if you do, make it just a taste/spoonful. Take a 10 minute walk right after your meal. When you get dessert, try to confine it to about three bites worth.

    "selftext": "Hi,  \n  \nJust want to share some personal experiences in this T2 diabetes journey.\n\nI am 58 yrs old male. Got diagnosed T2 with HBA1C 7.4% 2 years ago. Through controlled diets, exercises (walk, yoga, mediation), rest and self stress management and without any medication from beginning until now, my A1C gradually dropped to 6.8% then 6.1% then 5.4% and currently 5.2% and stays steady for the past 10 months. But, it's not about the numbers, it's about the whole system reaching the level of healing, adapting and self regulating.\n\nOne of the keys I have found throughout my journey is that **our body has wonderful capabilities to recover and to heal if we give it time and right conditions**. We might have unknowingly overworked or even abused our body over a long period and then we forcefully and frantically try to reverse the course in such stressful way.\n\nI’ve learnt that we need to listen to our body’s response little by little and patiently help it correcting and healing. It needs time to learn and to create new and good memories.\n\nI know that medication might be helpful to stop the damages but medication is unlikely to heal or to help our body to recover, specifically with T2 and especially if we maintain the habit of destroying our body. The process of healing and recovering require the complete reprogramming of our internal system to find harmony, balance and rhythm again, which might take a long time. The more rush, the more stress, the more harm done as the body is not a computer you can reset instantly. It is a *biological memory system* that needs time.\n\nTo heal and to recover, we need:\n\n* rhythm\n* rest\n* movement\n* nourishment\n* sunlight\n* calmness\n* consistency\n\nAnd avoid:\n\n* panic\n* over-diet\n* over-fasted\n* over-exercised\n* over-restricted\n* punished ourselves\n* got frustrated\n* tried to “fix everything in 3 weeks”\n\nAnd memory takes time:\n\n* to rewrite\n* to stabilise\n* to trust new patterns\n* to unlearn old stress responses\n\nThe body heals in ***slow waves***, **not violent jumps**.  \n\n\nI know we have different life styles, circumstances, environments but we all are having the same things: we have time to eat, to rest, to walk, to exercise, even very little. In our modern life these days, our lives are too fast, we are too stressed, we are eating too much ultra processed foods, we are moving our bodies too little, we are staying inside too much, we are sitting down too long. Fortunately, **we can all change these little by little**.\n\n**Recovery should be sustainable and enjoyable**. It should not be a burden or something we are so stressed over (such as we still want to eat that much cake, drink that much soda etc). If we relying on medication so that we can still harm our body then it will reach the inevitable consequence sooner. Instead, we can save medication for the later years when our body is old and run down, our muscles are no longer enough to absorb glucose, our pancreas is blunt and our insulin is so bad. In the meantime, we can always help our system to reprogram and to heal.\n\nCheers,",

You’re even trying to sound like you understand what’s going on in the body medically, yet I doubt that you even have a grasp of what’s happening at the cellular level. Native Americans, for example, have genetic predispositions for low beta cell function, no matter how well they “rest and recover”. Understanding the epidemiology of a cellular-level predisposition to insulin resistance is much more than just saying “you’re not calm enough and you need more sunlight”. To equate “relying on medication” with harming your body is absolutely sending the wrong message to people. My endocrinologist informed me that for many people with diabetes, medication is a critical and non-negotiable part of their treatment plan, regardless of how meticulously they manage their diet and exercise. A healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise) is an important foundation of treatment, but it is often insufficient over time due to the progressive nature of the disease. Medication can become necessary to maintain safe blood sugar levels, prevent long-term complications affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, and supplement the body's diminishing ability to produce or use insulin effectively, regardless of how stressed we are. You talk about only needing it when your body is “old and run down”, but your experience at your age isn’t going to be everyone else’s.",

I immediately went on metformin 2x a day and glipizide 1 a day. Also immediately changed my diet. No carbs or sugar. I had a meeting with a diabetic educator a few days ago and she was very happy with my progress. My average numbers the past week have been between 105-125. When I get below 90 I experience symptoms of \"lows\" (shaking, vision blur, dizzy, sweating). I eat candy or something and feel ok shortly after. Doc said it was normal for me right now. She told me to stop taking the glipizide and so now im only doing metformin 1000 mg total a day. She said eventually I can decide if I want to stay on that or change to mounjaro, that it is up to me. \nI have no idea?? Food is stressing me out so much. Im eating great. But the constant food noise in my mind is burning me out already. Im vegetarian and recycling the same handful of meals throughout the week.. they are delicious but I still crave things I can't have. Desperately.\nFinger pricking is also getting so old lol. She gave me a free 10 day dexcom g7, and it has been informative to see how levels rise and fall. But the device has been wrong by about 20 points each time I double check with a finger prick test...\nAnyways. Sorry for rambling, ultimately im curious if you prefer metformin or Mounjaro? Or have any advice for me on deciding?\nThank you in advance &lt;3",

I am asking because they have so much more varieties of leafy greens so you're have plenty of options.  (And IMO, the Asian veggies are so much more flavorful anyway.)\n\nAdditionally, I don't want to be on Mounjaro because I don't want to lose weight.  If I lose even 10lbs, I will be underweight according to BMI calculation.  I know not everyone lose weight on GLP-1 but since my current medication, lifestyle and diet is keeping my numbers at a good level, I am not going to mess with what is working.  I also do finger pricking, it is just part of my routine now that I am used to.  So it doesn't bother me that much.

This would lead to a long run of bad eating habits and even worse numbers.\n\nIt isn't a magic bullet, but wearing a CGM suddenly made everything clear to me.  What was confusing and mysterious to me before was now simple and obvious.  Something about seeing that visual representation just made everything click.  It also helped me identify foods that I thought were safe for me that actually weren't, and others that I was avoiding that are actually fine.\n\nMy diabetes is now very well managed (last three A1C's were 5.4, 5.2 and 5.3).  Knowing that it is so well managed helps me mentally handle when I have a setback or make a mistake and eat something that spikes me more than expected.  It doesn't feel like the end of the world, because I know I can get right back on track.\n\nIf you haven't been prescribed one, I would recommend asking your doctor about trying one.

    "selftext": "Hello all! I am going to see my primary care provider tomorrow morning about my constant thirst and urination. My diabetes diagnosis was in March of this year and i was at a 6.6 but my symptoms started in the summer. When I started experiencing these symptoms I thought it was because my A1C was still high but I've had two subsequent tests done and have been at a 5.8 and a 5.6. From the middle of summer up to this day ive been peeing 10 to 15 times a day and drinking a ton of liquids. The sensation to pee creeps up on me after around 45 minutes and most of the time I pee a decent amount but sometimes its only a little.\n\nIve been trying to figure out what is causing this but im not sure. I have an appointment tomorrow and hope I can get some answers but feel like it might not happen. Ive looked online and saw a few potential causes of this issue.\n\n1. Hyperinsulinemia: where the body creates too much insulin and cant use it since we are insulin resistant. Frequent thirst and urination are symptoms.\n\n2. Diabetic prostate: where diabetes damages the prostate and can lead to frequent urination and UTIs, among other things.\n\n3. Neuropathy of the Bladder: where neuropathy damages the bladder leading to excessive urination and always feeling like you didnt empty out your bladder after you pee.\n\n4. Medication: I take Fluvoxamine 200mg daily and one effect is dry mouth, so maybe that's what's making me extra thirsty. I doubt this is the issue as I didnt have dry mouth before my diabetes started while on this medication.\n\nIt's one thing to just experience these bothersome symptoms by themselves but unfortunately, they can cause damage down the road. Im worried about these persistent symptoms damaging my kidneys. The frequent dehydration can eventually lead to kidney disease and i really dont want that. I had a creatinine test done a few weeks back and I believe they were at a 1.04 when they should be below a 1.02. Creatinine can indicate how well your kidneys function.\n\nI dont know why I am feeling this way, ive tested my blood glucose a handful of times the last week and a half and they are in the normal range. I hope it isnt anything bad. Im only 29 and im worried these symptoms will stay with me forever. Are you guys familiar with any issues of the Bladder/Prostate or hyperinsulinemia and have you had kidney disease from diabetes?\n\nThanks ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! I (F 28) have been dealing with a problem and would appreciate any kind of advice. Last year my a1c was 5.1 and fasting blood sugar 78. Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia. \nIn October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.",

Specific use case at this time would be \"grains\", but later also would be other starches like potatoes, etc..\n\nI am currently of the belief that I need (want?) to know \"Total carbs\", \"fiber\", \"sugar alcohols\", \"sugars\", \"glycemic index\", etc.. I am understanding that I can calculate \"net carbs\", which from what I can tell thus far is the most significant parameter.\n\nThis started with my having stumbled across (online) recommendations to eat hulled barley rather than rice\\*\\*\\*. This source made a clear distinction between \"pearled barley\" and \"hulled barley\". This source made it appear the difference to be vast (between barley and rice as well as pearled and hulled barley). So I started substituting hulled barley for white rice. My wife asked my why I was doing that. So we went online (our phones at the dinner table) and started looking at numbers. Our initial hits indicated hulled barley to be WAY higher than white rice in carbohydrates, which puzzled me and caused me to dig slightly deeper at the time to find that, apparently, the numbers were for RAW rice and barley. And on and on and on it went to the point of me deciding I needed to create a spreadsheet to keep track and then be able to easily reference.\n\n\\*\\*\\*(OK, it was \"FED\" to me by the \"barley industry\", no doubt)\n\nFAIL FAIL FAIL\n\nProblem is that I can't find any SINGLE source for all of this information and when I start looking at a variety of sources offering only a portion of the relevant parameters I find that those parameters contained in both sources are significantly different. Therefore I don't know which of them to accept. Further compounding it is that some sources show the values for \"raw\", while not making it apparent, and other sources are showing for \"cooked\", while not making it apparent. There is a large difference between \"raw\" and \"cooked\" when it comes to grains. Who eats raw rice, anyway?\n\nHave any of you out there found a single source that lists all these parameters and has them in \"raw\" for AND \"cooked\"?\n\nFor grains, \"cooked\" is probably the only relevant form I would be eating. But other foods, like vegetables it would make total sense to eat raw and cooked so the values for raw and cooked would be relevant.\n\nUPDATE: I found a site that at least has some potential, others might be interested. [https://glycemicindex.com/](https://glycemicindex.com/)\n\nThis is a site run by the University of Sydney. They have a database that has what looks to be a comprehensive listing of various food-stuffs with their Glycemic Index and Glycemic Loads. I've noticed a problem with it, though, which I'm trying to work through now.\n\nI'm thinking that if I can get \"Glycemic Load\" for ingredients and don't need to stress over the actual carbs and sugars and fibers. My understanding is that \"Glycemic Load\" takes all of that into account and comes up with a number representing the overall impact on the amount of carbohydrates your body has to battle and how quickly.  A low GL (Glycemic Load\" indicates the foodstuff is one or the other or a combination of low carbs, low sugar, high fiber, etc.,. The higher the fiber is the lower/slower the sugars are released (something along those lines) or simply lower carbs means lower sugars to be dealt with, etc..",

The typical 3 to 8 AM window only applies when the liver still responds reasonably well to insulin. When the liver is insulin resistant, the glucose output doesn’t shut off after you wake up, so the elevated numbers can run much longer, even up to late morning.\n\nA few things can extend it to 10 or 11 AM:\n\n1. Cortisol rhythm: Your cortisol peaks around waking but stays elevated for hours afterward. If the liver is insulin resistant, it keeps releasing glucose the whole time.\n2. Hepatic IR: If the liver isn’t responding to insulin, taking meds earlier or going lower carb won’t fix the morning drift. The liver just keeps dumping glucose longer than it should.\n3. Low carb breakfast: Eggs and coffee won’t spike you, but they also don’t give any insulin signal to suppress liver glucose output. If hepatic IR is present, the liver needs at least a small insulin response to shut off the flood.\n4. Counterregulatory hormones: Growth hormone, adrenaline, and cortisol overlap for longer in some people, especially under stress or sleep disruption.\n\nA quick test:  \nTry adding a small amount of low glycemic carbs with some protein, like half a cup of steel cut oats or a slice of whole grain bread with your eggs. If your numbers drop faster afterward, that means your liver needed an insulin signal to shut off production.\n\nYou’re not alone. In people with hepatic insulin resistance, dawn phenomenon stretching until 10 to 11 AM is actually pretty common.",

Many of us indulged in poor eating habits, but there IS a genetic component, even for type 2.  If it helps for the long term coping, many folks here who have been diabetic decades report aging with better health BECAUSE diabetes forces them to embrace good habits:  eating well, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, managing stress.  The people successful long term are people who take it seriously and do \"all the things\" to improve their health.\n\nIt is definitely overwhelming initially.\n\nIf you're not ready to tell family, don't.  Enjoy your birthday and do some quiet things to minimize impact on your blood sugar.  Like, if cooking at home or going out, maybe opt for a steak or chicken and have a big salad.  Skip the potato and then have cake.  And try to go for a walk afterward.  Most of us indulge a bit for special events...it's more a matter of being good MOST OF THE TIME and not turning an \"indulgence\" into a bacchanalian extravaganza (like 3 helpings of mashed potatoes and stuffing and then multiple pieces of pie).  You could maybe tell a half white lie for your birthday and say you have been feeling better eating keto, but you will splurge on a piece of cake.\n\nI only told two people about my initial diagnosis.  Other family members had enough on their plates and I didn't want to worry them so I didn't tell others for 6 months.  And by then I'd had two more doctor's visits, made major changes, and had my a1c down to 6 (lower now).\n\nYou can do this.  There will likely be a lot of food posts headed into Thanksgiving and that will give you a feel for how people balance things for special events.  Take it a step at a time for now...take prescribed meds, add in exercise, reduce your carbs.  If your doctor hasn't set you up with a nutritionist, ask for that appointment.\n\nEDIT:  Just wanted to add this:  I went through my pantry soon after diagnosis.  Food banks are in desperate need right now so if you are motivated to get rid of unopened bags, boxes, and cans of things like rice, pasta and other carby things, you can remove the temptations from your home and help someone else at the same time.",

It really does get better once you’ve had some time to process, climb the first part of the learning curve and settle on a plan that you feel good about moving forward with. That all takes a bit of time.\n\nBe kind and go easy on yourself as much as you can. Get some extra r&amp;r. This isn’t your fault. I’m sure you can think of 15 people your age who have similar lifestyles but don’t have diabetes. The genetic component is huge.\n\nThe things that helped me most at the beginning:\n\nThe book The Diabetes Code by Jason Fung helped me learn about how diabetes worsens and improves in the body. He also goes into low/lower carb eating and intermittent fasting (IF). Just know that super low carb eating and IF aren’t appropriate or right for everyone, though they do help many. There are lots of different eating plans. In time you’ll find something that works well for you. Also, I don’t involve myself in the controversy over terms like remission, good control, etc. The goal is improved health and wellbeing.\n\nAlso, my sessions with my diabetes educators were invaluable. 1-hour sessions with someone who’s kind and knowledgeable to help me figure out my initial plan and to pepper with my 100s of questions. My insurance covered these 100%.\n\nThis sub was really helpful too. Lots of good info, others’ personal and varied experiences, and lots of kindness and support.\n\nHang in there, you’ll figure this thing out given a bit of time. ❤️🧸",

First started taking the small doses and eventually made my way up to 1mg starting March of 2024. Since that time I’ve lost 60 lbs and my A1C Hoovers between 5.6 to 5.8 (at its highest it was around 10). But for the last six months , maybe longer, I’ve plateaued. I still want to get down to 160lbs (I’m at about 173lbs)  and would love to reach an A1C around 5.3. I get way more food cravings now than I did last year and because of work and being a parent I don’t get to excercise as much as I use to when I started getting serious about taking care of myself starting diabetes.\n\nMy endocrinologist said I could just try doubling my dosage, but also stressed this was the highest dosage. At the moment, I also take Jardiance daily, 1000mg of Metformin, a statin and Linsilpro. \n\nI turn 46 next mint and I just want to live a real long life because I’m dad with a young kid. ",

I was referred to my local diabetes in pregnancy clinic and started on insulin and metformin within two days. The first 8 weeks after diagnosis were really hard. My blood sugar was wildly out of control. I was trying to find the dose of insulin that worked. I was walking on the treadmill three times a day to minimize spikes. But I was in a good range after 8 weeks, and maintenance was easier than getting there. My a1c was 5.0 at 4 months in and I maintained that until the end of my pregnancy. I had 13 ultrasounds. They did an early anatomy scan to look for birth defects caused by high blood sugar, but that was clear. I had regular growth scans starting at 28 weeks, and I don't even know how many NSTs I had. My baby was perfectly fine though. My OB said she showed no signs of being affected by it at all. She was 6lbs9oz at birth, born at 37+4 weeks gestation, and she had no hypoglycemia, no jaundice, and I healed beautifully from my c section. I think the main thing was that the mental load was really high. Especially at the end of the pregnancy, I was dealing with lows, so calculating the right amounts of insulin to keep my after meal numbers in range and my fasting in range without sending me too low was a lot of work.",

I saw my endo once a month, talked to my diabetes team (nurses and dieticians) every 2 weeks, and saw my OB every week by the end. In my third trimester, I did a no-stress test at the hospital every week and had ultrasounds for baby’a size every 2 weeks. I also had a couple extra ultrasounds for baby’s heart at a cardiologist since that is standard for diabetes women where I am.\n\nManaging my sugars was really really hard because I would spike unexpectedly, my sugars would peak like 3-4 hours after a meal instead of the expected 2 hours, and exercise was hard because I was sooo tired from the pregnancy. It’s all the placenta they throws things out of whack. I would eat the same thing every day for breakfast and some days I would go high, some days I would be perfectly in range…..it felt like such a crapshoot.\n\nThat being said my A1c when I started pregnancy was 6.9, and it was down to 5.5 in my third trimester. I was induced ar 38 weeks (standard for diabetics) and my baby was 7.5 lbs. there is a big risk if your sugars are high, your baby will have low blood sugar, so baby’s blood sugar is tested 4 times in the first 24 hours of their life. Baby was perfect in my case.\n\nAs hard as it all was, especially all the monitoring and appointments - I of course would say it was worth it. We are happy and healthy now and I am forgetting day by day how hard it was and am contemplating a second baby.\n\nYou can likely find more on the sub bumperswhobolus but it does also include T1. \n\nGood luck!",

I’m currently **210 lbs**, diagnosed with **Type 2 diabetes**, and trying to lose weight while keeping my sugars in check.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, fasting (whether intermittent fasting or longer windows like 16:8 / 18:6) can help **lower insulin resistance**, **reduce blood sugar**, and even push some people toward **remission**. But what I’m trying to understand is the *long game* —\n\n* **Does fasting work long term?** Like, do people really maintain lower A1C and weight years later, or does it plateau or rebound once you stop fasting?\n* **What are the effects of fasting over many years?** Does metabolism slow down, or does the body adapt well if you stick with a sustainable routine (say 16:8 most days)?\n* **If you’ve done this yourself**, how did your fasting schedule evolve over time? Did you combine it with low-carb or keto, or just calorie restriction?\n\nI’m hoping to hear from people who’ve tried fasting for 6+ months or even years — especially **those managing diabetes without medication** or reducing their meds along the way.\n\nAny lessons learned, pitfalls, or advice for someone starting this journey?\n\nThanks in advance 🙏  \n*(Planning to start slow, maybe a 14:10 or 16:8 schedule and gradually build from there.)*",

My doctor said I need insulin but I refused. I weighed 225 lbs. I’m 5ft tall\n\nI started slow, a week or so of 18:6 which I found surprisingly easy. Then I moved to  OMAD. After about a month I pressed myself even more. I did a two day fast one week, three days the next, four and a half day fast the next! The results were amazing. I was quite proud of my accomplishment. Wow four days without eating holy crap!\n\nMy GP doc was zero help through the process. I was on tons of meds for diabetes high blood pressure rheumatoid arthritis cholesterol etc. when I said I was keto he was horrified. Said just keep taking meds and try to exercise a bit. Forget about mentioning fasting he would drop dead. My rheumatologist was a bit better as he was Muslim and supported me with OMaD\n\nI tested my blood continuously always worried I’d keel over with a hypo. Never happened. At first my BG would come down but still be elevated. I stuck with it and sure enough it went lower and lower while fasting. Just as Fung promised. \n\nThen I started to do some longer fasts but by this time I bought a ketone monitor. I was getting BG readings of 3.8/3.9 during my fasts but felt fantastic!!! My ketones were high, I was totally running off my body fat!\n\nMy meds became problematic as I was healing. As mentioned I could not talk to\nMy doc about this zero support. I noticed I was getting dizzy when I stood up. Dr Google told me to check Blood pressure. I went to the drug store daily for a while to check. Yep low. I stopped my BP med and felt great\n\nI basically weaned myself off all\nMy meds by myself as I healed…reverse order from\nWhen prescribed. \n\nI went for a physical and assorted blood. In 4 months I lowered a1c to 4.6. Normal Cholesterol, great triglycerides, normal bp, normal EKG. Normal everything. I still had RA of course but even my CRP was much lower\n\nWhen I told my doc I hadnt taken my meds for two months his\nMouth dropped open\n\nI even went for a bone scan and\nFound out my bone density improved greatly since Last check up. My acid reflux was gone too\n\nEventually I got sick of fasting. Can’t explain it. Just stopped. Lost my mojo. Lost 60 pounds. I stayed keto for a long while. Then morphed to low carb. Then carb creep. Back to high carb. Here comes diabetes again once you are at that point. \n\nSo ya. Back to keto/low carb. These days not doing huge fasting just some\nIF and skipping meals. \n\nAs soon as you change your diet back to the way it was, all your problems rapidly return \n\nBTW still overweight but the 60lbs I lost during fasting is still off.

I'm not off all the meds but I probably could  be. Mounjaro is such a good drug and my insurance pays for it so why come off?\n\nAnyway, yes. You can keep the fat off once you stop seriously fasting but you do still have to keep most of the lifestyle changes. It's important to strength train and maintain/grow muscle mass. \n\nI also find it way harder to fast now. When I was obese it was relatively easy, now I get light headed. No idea why.

If you are able to lose weight, do intermittent fasting, add muscles and control your carb intake (or some combination of these), many people do show improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation.  In some cases, you can reduce your medication or, less frequently, eliminate your medicines altogether. However, it is still just remission, i.e. you need to maintain that state actively. If you go back to your old life style or add back the weight, your insulin resistance will come back. On the flip side, most of these things have many benefits even outside of diabetes. And even if it is temporary, it will be beneficial.\n\nIf you are going to do it, you have do it carefully because between not eating too many carbs in each meal and having a limited amount of time to eat, intermittent fasting almost always leads to significant caloric deficit. You have to up your protein intake and put in some weight training to ensure that the weight loss does not come from muscle loss. Ideally work with a dietician. There is a lot of woo on the internet so you could end up overdoing it and being miserable with minimal benefit.",

        "body": "I'm a huge fan of fasting--so many benefits beyond weight loss. I'd read Fung's book and was intrigued, but it wasn't until I learned of autophagy that I tried it. I started with IF, stretched to 24 hour, then 36 hour and now targeting 48 hour fasts once a week. Other benefits I hadn't anticipated: lower food bill, more time (not spent shopping, cooking, cleaning). I can't say I love fasting, but it's kinda like exercise--you get used to it and the benefits far outweigh the effort.\n\nHonestly, it was this podcast about Rapamycin (a cancer and anti-aging drug with many of same impacts as fasting) that made me curious and sent me down the rabbit hole to recognize the overall health benefits of fasting. [https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub](https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub)\n\nHeres the AI take on autophagy.  (Note that I  researched peer-reviewed credible sources on my trip down the rabbit hole, and I encourage anyone interested to do the same): \n\nFasting triggers autophagy, a cellular \"clean-up\" process where the body removes and recycles damaged components. This cellular renewal is activated by nutrient and energy deprivation, which suppresses pathways like mTOR, allowing autophagy to begin. Short-term fasts (16-24 hours) and longer fasts (24-48 hours or more) can both induce autophagy, though prolonged periods may also engage different mechanisms.  \n\nHow fasting activates autophagy\n\n* **Nutrient deprivation:** When you fast, your cells experience a lack of nutrients and energy. \n* **Signaling pathways:** This lack of nutrients triggers a cellular response that activates enzymes like AMPK and inhibits the mTOR pathway, which are key regulators that \"put the brakes\" on autophagy. \n* **Initiating the process:** With the brakes off, autophagy can begin. This involves the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membraned structures that engulf and transport cellular waste to the lysosomes for breakdown and recycling. \n\nEffects and benefits of autophagy during fasting\n\n* **Cellular cleanup:**  Autophagy removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, helping to maintain cellular health and function. \n* **Cellular efficiency:**  It can lead to a more efficient cell by removing unnecessary components. \n* **Potential disease prevention:**  Studies suggest a link between autophagy and the prevention of diseases associated with cellular waste, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. \n* **Fat burning:**  Autophagy, specifically a process called lipophagy, can aid in burning fat by removing potentially toxic lipids. \n* **Energy production:**  A byproduct of autophagy, alanine, can be sent to the liver to help create glucose through gluconeogenesis. ",

        "body": "It works. Short and long term. IN COMBINATION with a low carb and/or ketogenic diet. It worked for me and has done for many many people- long term.\n\nI think of it in 2 stages: \n1. Correction \n2. Maintenance.\n\nFor correction consider going keto first, then adding IF after about a month. Reason is that bringing carbs down to that level (20-30g per day) helps your body metabolism to switch from burning primarily glucose for fuel to primarily burning fats for fuel. In addition to that wonderful shift, your hunger hormones start getting back in balance and no longer drive cravings and feelings of deep hunger. Fasting at that point becomes easy. Varying the length is super helpful too. Pick a minimum daily # of hours like 12, and then do some days 17, some 19 etc. Then add a couple longer ones a month…24, 36, 48.\n\nIt will work. Takes between 6-12 months.\n\nOnce you’ve got your a1c, lipid panel, other labs, and weight where you want them, start slowly and carefully adding some carbs back…try 40g for a week. Make sure you’ve not gained any weight back or seen more spikes.  Then try 50g for a week.. check spikes, weight and notice if your cravings have shown back up etc… keep your fasting schedule to at least your minimum.\nPay attention to how you’re feeling and spikes and weight. They will tell you if you’ve added too much back. \n\nLots of people have done this for decades. \nCheck out Beat Diabetes channel on yt. Lots of people talking about doing this long term.",

Her response simply was “we don’t know enough about diabetes to say a certainty. Being predisposed via genes, hormone imbalance, and a lifestyle impact. There could be 10 women, in this room who lived as you lived and look the same as you, but with different genetics would not get diabetes.” But I know when people hear type2 they assume I am an egregious consumer of food and sugar..\n\nEver since my diagnosis I’ve been so ashamed.

If it's a private office, and they do an A1C, glucose, and whatnot, $200 is more than fair in most areas of the country. If you're living in Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, LA, NYC, you could consider like $250. If it's hospital based, file for charity care so they can possibly lower your bill. \n\nAsk for a 3 month supply of CGM sensors. \n\nDepending on how high your A1C is, they may want insulin anyway, which is sometimes a requirement for the CGMs. If nothing else, get a glucometer, lancets (33g my pref) and check as directed. \n\nIf you start insulin, you're going to probably need to check in with them weekly for a bit to titrate to get to a more manageable level. Idk how much metformin you're on or A1C but know that it is a possibility. That shouldn't cost too much in terms of fees if at all.

If you try to do too much at once, it won’t be successful. She will need to permanently change her diet and lifestyle, adding in more movement to help regulate blood sugar. Many of the more dire outcomes of diabetes can be prevented by taking these changes seriously now, as damage occurs over the long term.\n\nLook into keto diet, although you do not want to completely eliminate carbs, just reduce them. It is kind of helpful in a way that she wants to eat the same things all the time. That makes counting carbs easier for most meals. However, the carb content of those meals may need to change from what she is eating now. Generally, half her plate should be non starchy vegetables, a quarter should be protein, and a quarter should be starch. You still have to watch servings sizes: maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown rice, or a half of a small sweet potato. If she will eat nuts, that is a good snack as long as she doesn’t eat too many.\n\nI would put all her meds in an online “drug interaction” site to see if any of these meds interact poorly with each other. I’d see if I could speak to a pharmacist/chemist too. Metformin is well known for causing gastric distress (diarrhea), especially at first, so it’s odd she has reduced bowel movements.",

Generally, whenever any statin is prescribed, the doctor usually puts them on CoQ10 because it depletes the CoQ10 in the body which causes muscle aches, etc..\n\nYour question was about why she was laying in bed and feeling tired, this has nothing to do with her carb intake.

So it might simply be possible that you need a stronger form of the drug.\n\nThe other downside is that rybelsus feedback is that its a real pain to take. restrictions around fasting with it etc.. \n\nthe other downsides are the same side effects possible with ozempic.\n\n\"but, yeah, no\" doesn't really describe why you're concerned about ozempic. It's a great drug. If its the needle thing it shouldn't be an issue - it's a nothingburger. It's way less of a deal than a finger stick.. tiny needle, just goes under the skin - it's nothing like a vaccination or veinous blood draw. braindead simple to do. not a big deal.",

Years later, I was put on Mounjaro and it’s been fantastic. I think any of these options are worth a shot because GLP-1s have been life changing for me. But, you do have to find the right one for you. No harm in trying Rybelsus, but it’s possible it might not be right for you.

Yes, I still do finger pricks to see if the morning reading is really low, or if I ended up sleeping on it. \n\nIf you especially are on insulin, I recommend getting a CGM.

It's all low carb enough not to spike me and it takes a minute to have a PB&amp;J and be satisfied and done.\n\nAtkins brand TV dinners aren't the best ever but their pizzas will make you feel like you cheated without spiking you. And the TV dinners tend to work okay for a meal when you don't want to cook.\n\nIf you want to order out, wingstop is really easy to eat at with diabetes. Taco bell has some bowls that are fun. If you buy some low cab tortillas to keep at home, you could throw the contents of the bowls into them a make a low carb junk food buritto at home.\n\nYeah, none of these ideas will help you lose weight or \"get healthy\" but they'll fit within a diet meant to keep your A1C in a range that doesn't destroy your internal organs.\n\nIf you want to be \"healthy\" and not cook, you could always get a rotisserie chicken and a ceasar salad kit. A few croutons will fit into your carb limit and will make you feel like a human while you're still getting fiber from salad and some healthy protein from chicken.\n\nNot every meal has to be home-cooked. You can even find fun foods. Low A1C is more important than fiber and healthy right now. Get that A1C down and then focus on the greens and nutrients. It'll be easier to focus on the healthy foods when you aren't in high blood sugar land.",

        "body": "One thing that has really helped me lower my numbers is just giving up rice completely, I never liked brown rice but eating white rice was always a staple in my diet.  I've given up rice for what's been almost a year now and don't miss it, I'll have some if I'm craving it but seldom do. \n\nHere is my reasoning for giving up rice,  a bowl of rice is like 40-50 carbs?  a bowl of brown rice is like 35-45 carbs?  Roughly, I don't recall exactly what they are.  So would I rather eat those empty carbs or could I just eat a piece of fried chicken instead.  For instance, a breast at popeyes fried chicken is about 16 carbs compared to like 30 plus carbs for a filler rice .  I just go through this game with myself, would I rather eat this or have some rice.  \n\nWhat I've also done is just have a rotation of vegetables around and allow myself to not count calories on them and just eat until I'm as full as I want to be.  I can either eat them like a salad or just saute them for a few minutes and use salt, pepper, butter, and chicken bouillon on them for simplicity or do a more traditional asian stir fry with them.  The veggies I go for is broccoli, zucchini or green squash, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, bok choy, various kinds of spinach and just whatever is different if I'm getting bored.  \n\nAlso if you are tired of having crackers as snacks, it goes back to doing some trade offs.  Can I cut this from my meal and sub it for something else so then I can have a more savory snack that might have some carbs in it.  \n\nLastly, something else that has helped me control my A1C1 is just making sure I take a walk after my meals, I aim for 15 minutes and generally try to have 10k steps by the end of the day.",

I asked if he’d seen a doctor. He used to drink 4 liters of Coke a day, plus a liter of fruit juice, greasy foods, white bread — his diet was terrible.\n\n\n\n# Then he started urinating 4 times a night, foamy urine, mouth dry like sandpaper. I told him, “Let’s go to the doc.” His fasting glucose came back 13.1, so the doctor ordered full labs. My brother immediately went cold turkey — quit all the junk, started drinking only water and lime. His urine cleared up, the foam went away, the thirst stopped. But the damage was done.\n\n\n\n# Lab results:\n\n\n\n# HbA1c: 14.1\n\n\n\n# ALT: 69\n\n\n\n# Cholesterol: 5.8\n\n\n\n# Doc put him on Metformin 500mg twice a day, a blood pressure pill, baby aspirin, and statins (20mg). After 4 days on that combo, my brother was exhausted — barely talking, no appetite, legs cramping, no energy. We saw another doctor who said to stop the statin — 20mg was too strong for a body already drained from rapid weight loss and no carbs. He also said the blood pressure meds were unnecessary since my bro doesn’t even have high blood pressure — it was just drying him out and depleting electrolytes.\n\n\n\n# A day after stopping those meds, he perked up again — started eating and feeling alive.\n\n\n\n# Now, here’s the problem: he’s still losing weight, even though he’s eating healthy. Doc said to cut the low GI brown bread, but I can’t — if I do, he’ll waste away. He’s hungry all the time. His glucose is still up — fasting around 13, 11, 10, and after meals 8.2 or 9. Doc says insulin could drop him too low because his post-meal readings aren’t that bad, but I’m scared we’re just watching him fade slowly.\n\n\n\n# Please, if you’ve gone through this — or helped someone get their strength back — I need some hope or guidance. I just want him to gain healthy weight again and get his energy back.\n\n\n\n# Thank you.",

However, in the last month, I was informed that the OneTouch was no longer supported by my insurance (I called my insurance and they said that the Ultra2 was old tech so they no longer covered it) Okay, sure, fine.\n\nThey shift me over to the Accu-Check Guide Me.  I still have plenty of stuff left to use for the OneTouch, So I'm going to use that up before I dig into the accucheck.\n\nBut I did go ahead and try it so I could see how it worked, and on one blood draw I got vastly different numbers. Enough so it makes me go 'should...should I call my doc about this?'\n\nYesterday evening's numbers:\n\nOne Touch Ultra2 - 137\n\nAccu-check - 97  \n\n\nThis morning's draw numbers:\n\n  \nOneTouch Ultra2 -122\n\nAccu-Check Guide Me - 107\n\n  \nHow could they be \\*that\\* different?

        "body": "The Accu-Chek Guide and Guide Me are the better meters compared to models based on older tech.  If you want to compare them try testing the same (big) drop of blood with both meters.  You'll find one tends to read higher than the other. This is true of almost all meters on the market that use different test strips.  A meter or batch of test strips can be faulty and give a similar result but even when working perfectly there's always a 'relative bias' in the readings between different meters.\n\nThe basic standard for meters (basically) says that they should be within 15% of true objective accuracy at least 95% of the time.  That's plus or minus 15%, so two meters can give readings from the same drop of blood that are consistently nearly 30% apart, on average, and both still meet the basic standards.\n\nIn the most recent independent study I know of the Contour Next One came out on top for accuracy, followed by the Accu-Chek Guide and OneTouch Verio Reflect.  These meters are based on the most recent tech and the manufacturers have invested in producing the most accurate meters possible (and charge a premium price for the test strips).\n\nI own all three of these models along with eight others as I was interested in finding the best affordable meter(s) for calibrating CGMs with.  The difference between the Contour Next One and some of the cheaper meters I own which use older technology is stark.  When levels are stable such as before meals you can test over and over again with the Next and get very similar numbers.  Some of the cheaper models would produce readings which jump around all over the place, and only a few of them, the Accu-Chek Guide being one, would produce readings that were consistently close to the Next.  That said, the Guide almost always gives a reading that is a little higher than the Next.",

Pick whichever one is easier/cheaper to use and stick with it.  You’ll just drive yourself crazy otherwise.\n\nDon’t get too hung up on your exact glucose number unless it’s really high or low.

Once first thing, then again at various time depending on the day. This weekend was different because I was volunteering at a Con and was forced to eat \"con food\". If you know you know... \nI usually start the day around 120 and end the day around 90. Last night I took my sugar before dinner and was surprised to see a 67. I took it again to confirm and it gave me an 83. Should I tose it up to a bad strip, or have I just unlocked a new level of Diabetes? How many \"Lows\" should I wait for before talking to my Doctor?

    "selftext": "Hello all. I've started my weight loss journey a couple of weeks ago. I weighed 300 pounds then and also started Metformin 500mg daily to help my blood sugar even though my numbers are in range. I lost 10 pounds in a week but in that week I ate relatively healthy and walked a ton in Las Vegas (30+ miles in four days). Then last week I ate pretty darn good except for a couple meals and kept my calories and carbs low. I haven't weighed myself again since last week but I've had to have lost at least five more pounds. So in total I probably lost around 15 pounds in two weeks. Is this too much? I really want to lose weight to see if my diabetes can get better even though my numbers are in the normal range. Im super motivated to lose weight and want to lose it at a good pace and not too slow.\n\nI think ive had some side effects of losing this weight quickly. I think im more thirsty than usual. Can this weight loss lead to negative effects to my diabetes? Thank you for reading.",

        "body": "Nobody actually knows what a safe or healthy rate of weight loss is, so long as you're getting all the nutrients your body needs.  You'll see comments to the effect that around 1Kg per week, around 2 lbs, is a 'healthy' rate.  I read that online soon after I was diagnosed, but when I went looking for sources it turns out those numbers are basically made up, just something off the top of someone's head that stuck because there was no concrete research on the subject and so nothing to contradict it ('around 1 or 2 units of weight, or something, seems fine to me').  It's considered a safe rate but beyond that nobody really knows.\n\nLosing weight too fast may be unhealthy, but being obese definitely is unhealthy.  It may be worth taking a good vitamin supplement or two and using one of the better food tracking apps like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal to be sure you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, including things like Omega 3 oils and so on. Also, don't cut down on protein intake if you want to retain as much muscle mass as possible as you lose weight.  Don't exercise so much that you risk injury.  Drink plenty of water.  Beyond that nobody can actually tell you what is and isn't safe.  Nobody has ever done the experiment of intentionally getting a group of obese people to lose weight very quickly and for an extended period of time while at the same time feeding them all the nutrients they need (apart from the calories).  Without that piece of research nobody can give you a straight answer beyond 'around a kilo a week is probably fine'.\n\nEdit - the closest thing to such an experiment that I know of is the Newcastle diet used for Prof Taylor's Counterpoint study, which was a rapid weight loss diet for the purpose of Type 2 diabetes research.  That was an 800 calorie per day diet and the most serious reported side effect was temporary hair loss beginning after eight weeks or so into the diet.  If you Google 'Newcastle Diet booklet' you'll find a link to a PDF file on the Newcastle University website and all the observed side effects are listed in that booklet.",

Of course my weight couldn't have been a problem: I had been obese all my life with no problems, right?\n\nBut things took a bad turn. The camel's back was breaking. I had to go to the doctor and the diagnosis explained pretty much everything, but I knew I could do something about it.\n\nMy suggestion is start with the basics: lifestyle.\n\n* **Learn:** First I devoured a book that really helped me understand the condition and come up with an action plan. I used every resource provided by my insurance, employer, and health provider system. Met with a dietician, a health coach, and a diabetic care nurse. They reviewed my plan, gave me a big thumbs-up, and I just passed my 1st year anniversary of diagnosis. Avoid quacks who promise results based on just anecdotes without science and research to back them.\n* **Sleep**: Strive to get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. For me that meant no more sleeping to videos or movies, but playing instrumental music (or nothing).\n* **Meals**: Eat right. Don't go for \"woo\" diets that would make your grandparents shake their heads. I follow the general admonition \"Eat whole foods, mostly plants, and not too much.\" I'm vegan so for me animal products aren't \"food\". I adopted a whole-food, plant based diet, use the \"portion plate\" and measure my portions carefully. I don't strictly count carbs or calories, but I am very mindful of them. No food is \"good\" or \"bad\", but I strive to compose meals with an overall low-to-medium glycemic load.\n* **Activity**: Get up. Get moving. When I started there were days I didn't walk even 200 steps, but now I strive for 8,000 steps a day (the \"10,000 Steps\" movement was a marketing campaign and not based on science). I got a bicycle and started riding for errands. In months I was riding at least 30 minutes a day. Moreover I budget at least 15 minutes of activity after each meal. Either a walk around the block or a bike ride. If I time things right and the weather is good I'll eat then take a 5-10 mile ride to the store and back. Or go to the gym. Those are the meals I know I can handle harder glycemic loads.\n\nWelcome to the club! The entry process sucks, but the knowledge I was able to get about myself, health, and nutrition will make it worthwhile!\n\n(P.S. I'm on Metformin, **1000mg / 2x day**... I win? 🤪)",

We have removed most carbs, breads and snacks. I print off a booklet I created every month.  Every meal is picked for the right fuels for his body and trying to enjoy what hes eating (as I cook every meal) and Im now baking super seeded, low carb bread, not that he has it often but it helps and Im even making our own icecream (ninja creami) and every meal begins with a salad, as Im from an italian family we always ate salads after our main. Im making my own salad dressings and using apple cidar vinegar.  Im even making him chips/crisps using baked egg white and seasoning for snacks so be creative.  We're trying a \"whole food\" approach and not premade/packaged with chemicals or boxed food that promise low carb. Picking the correct vegetables and fruits, increased some dairy like greek yoghurt.  Lots of fish.  We were also told to not do low fat as his body needs good fats. Throw out the cooking oil and start using a good olive oil.  His HBAC1 was 14 and last month was 5.6.  We know Christmas is coming up so hes hoping to enjoy and indulge a bit.\n\nUnfortunately hes been unable to exercise as much as he would like so he has swimming x 2 and pilates x 1 per week and just started light weight training to build back the muscle he lost.  Weight training days his numbers are higher because thats what the body does so something to keep in mind and dont go animal in the gym.\n\nMy husband has hated his diagnosis, he sees it as a personal failure so its been a battle for him and he still refuses to accept it.  Even yesterday he number was higher than he wanted to see and he was a hot mess, swinging between anger and tears BUT, as I told him, stress does not help and when he is upset hes only hurting his body so we went through the day befores food diary and talked about some of his choices and switched a few things around.  For example, I know if he has lamb for dinner his bedtime and next morning number is higher so we avoid lamb.  When he is stressed or upset, I see his numbers go up so please try to work on that as well.  Good luck!\n\nEdit.

        "body": "Hi. I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was just recently diagnosed myself, on December 31, 2024, so I have less than a year of experience in managing my condition. But, that puts me pretty close to having been where you were in the recent past. \n\nNow, really, only you know what kind of person you are, what kind of habits and proclivities you have. So, what works for someone else won't necessarily work for you, and that's not your fault, that's just misapplication of a conditional solution. One of which you do not meet. \n\nSo, December 31, 2024, an ER doctor asks me, \"And what medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" and I said, \"Treat my what, now?\" Then he told me, \"Oh, your blood glucose is over 330. You have diabetes. You'll need to discuss this with your primary care physician immediately.\" And, then, when I got home, I, in my typically very placid and even keeled response, threw away every carbohydrate in my house. Then I went to the grocery store and I bought split chicken breasts and salad &amp; vegetables and cottage cheese and eggs.\n\nI baked the chicken breasts, prepared the vegetables, boiled some eggs, and I was ready to go for the week. \n\nI did that for about five weeks. On February 7, I started taking Mounjaro. Over those 5 weeks I had managed to lose 7 lbs. I went from 325 to 318. That was good weight loss. More than a pound a week. But, I thought, if this stuff is supposed to make me feel sated easier, with less, and full longer, I might be able to fine tune my diet to science the fuck out of diabetes. \n\nBecause, here's another one of those \"everyone's unique\" issues. I'm a mathematician and an engineer. You can't show me a problem, tell me, \"This problem is too difficult for most people to solve.\" silently challenging my capabilities, and expect I'm not going to analyze this thing down to the planck. \nFirst thing I did, I made a spreadsheet. You might be thinking I made a decent spreadsheet. You're imagining 3-4 separate sheets maybe. I showed this to a coworker and she said, \"Oh, you just recreated MyFitnessPal in...a spreadsheet?\" and, when she said that, I thought, \"She thinks I shouldn't have used a spreadsheet. I should have used some other tool. What other tool would that be? Okay, we can't think about this right now, or the pause will get too awkward. What should we say to move the conversation on?\" I responded, \"Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted to hack it together in a couple hours.\", to which she said, \"You recreated MyFitnessPal in a spreadsheet...in an afternoon? Hahaha.\" \n\nIt's here that I realized I misunderstood her first question's motive, and that she didn't have an opinion on my use of a spreadsheet to implement the solution, but that I would bother to implement a solution at all, when MyFitnessPal already exists. Why waste all of that effort? \n\nSo I replied, \"I know I could have downloaded MyFitnessPal, but I don't trust corporations with my personal data, plus, I get to display the numbers in any fashion I find interesting at the moment, linear, logarithmic, geometric, derivatives, integrals. I can see all the things, and it was interesting. I like to stretch myself on these fun tasks, and making a spreadsheet this sophisticated was a fun distraction. I learned some new tricks.\"\n\nShe nods, and we go back to discussing the important topic at hand, the numbers in the spreadsheet. It's very existence is just an assumed precondition for this story to progress. \n\nWe finish eating, and we go back to our meeting area. Oh, I think that might be important. This was at lunch in a pretty nice restaurant. Expensive, at least. Where I pulled my 16\" laptop out of my backpack and regaled everyone with the intricate details of all of the metrics I am measuring and all of the projections I'm projecting, and the graphics. Passing the laptop around the table. \n\nBack in the meeting area. My coworker walks over to a group of our coworkers and says, \"Hey guys, you should ask Eeyore_ to show you his spreadsheet.\" And someone said, \"What spreadsheet?\" So we sat down to a brief 30 minute presentation and narrative of my diabetes management behaviors.\n\nEveryone had a great time.\n\nThen things started to get weird. Everything before now is 100% normal person activity. Close enough to be within a single standard deviation of \"normal\" distribution. Because now I started making rules for my diet game. Why did I start making ridiculous BASEketball style rules? \n\nBecause I created a fucking scoreboard in my spreadsheet, so of course I have to win the top score! And, the points were how much weight I could lose. How improved my blood glucose was, how improved my liver enzymes were. How improved is my blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, all-the-things.\n\nOkay, so, what are these rules? Some of them are just ridiculous. \n\n* If I felt hungry, I could eat unlimited vegetables, but I restricted myself to only 2 tbsp max of salad dressing per meal. \n\nThis is an easy one. We'll start evolving off of this basic rule as we progress. So, one week it would be \"This week, I can only eat unlimited amounts of carrots.\" Everything else would be measured out, weighed out on a gram scale, and portioned appropriately. \n\nAgain, being a good scientist, I knew I needed a control group, or rather, some control stats so that I would be able to track what that unmedicated trend was like. So I began recording everything that would become relevant from the very beginning. First thing I did, even before I threw every carbohydrate out of my house, was start a notebook to take notes on my blood pressure, emotional state, energy, medication, perceived stress, food intake, bathroom frequency. Normal person stuff. The normal people do this kind of thing. If they can be bothered to stop doing and spend a little bit of time thinking before acting. \n\nSo, I said things were going to get weird. Because I had restricted my diet to such a narrow band of options, I had to gamify every other aspect of the experience, because, if I'm not going to get dopamine from eating the same chicken on the same salad for the 12th time this week, then I need to get that fix from something else. Something with numbers, and a scoreboard. And, having read Atomic Habits (Ultra AI abridged version, but, I got the gist of it. I read a few of them on repeat a dozen times. Normal person stuff.) I knew that gamifying these small habits can lead to chaining them long term and sticking as good habits. Just like clicker training a dog. Except I was contra-Inception-ing myself.  Fully aware of how I would condition myself, knowing intricately the workings of this psyche. \n\nLet's look at a simple breakfast rule. What are you going to eat for breakfast? Same thing we eat every day, Pinky, 1/2 cup of cottage cheese.\n\nWell, Eeyore_, here's the thing, you know, you **know** that you will eventually wear yourself out of managing to eat a food item if you eat it every day. You'll grow to hate it. So, we have to have some variety. But, that variety needs to be a surprise. I can't just alternate between 1/2 cup of cottage cheese one day and two boiled eggs the next, back and forth forever. Let's add some RNG to this. What will the RNG be? Well, how about this, Let's say you can eat two fried eggs over medium with some veggies if you get the jackpot, 2nd place is cottage cheese, 3rd place is boiled eggs, and last place is skip a solid breakfast, and have a glass of metamucil, and a protein shake. Okay, that rule seems a little intricate, maybe, but pretty straightforward. I don't see anything weird going on here. Definitely still normal person stuff. Normal normal person doing normal stuff.\n\nJackpot if you can go the whole night without getting up to whiz. 2nd place if you only get up once, and it's after 3 am. 3rd place, you whiz before 3 am and 4th place you whiz more than once through the night. \n\nBecause, for me, December of 2024 I was peeing 3 times a night, minimum, and I don't think I could go much more than 2 hours between trips to the urinal. \n\nAnd, now, 10 months and 10 days (9 months and 7 days with Mounjaro) into this leg of the adventure, I'm down 97 lbs at 6'3\". I weighed 228 this morning, and, while that still puts me in the \"overweight\" BMI range at 28.5, that's far better than the 41+ I started at. I'm still losing at 2 lbs a week. I'm aiming for 195. That's 33 lbs away. I could be there by the end of January if I can maintain this pace.\n\nMy blood glucose is very well managed. I aim for tight control, and I wear a CGM. Every metric of my health the doctors test for has improved to mostly the \"good\" range, with a few outside of the comfort zone, but not exactly the danger zone. Just the danger close zone. \n\nA few other peculiarities, I only allow myself 1/2 of an apple per day, or pear. I ate an orange over the course of a week. No more than two supremes per day, by volume. roughly 1/4 of an orange at a time, once a day. \n\nI aimed to consume 1,650 calories a day, and I am probably well below that many days. 3-4 days a week I might have to intentionally force myself to eat 1,200 calories worth of food.",

Plan ahead so you aren’t left in a position where you either go hungry and crash, or mess up your food routine. \n\nMy secret trick that really helped compared to previous diets: no more sweetness in any form.  Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you, but when I consumed them the actual healthy nutritive foods tasted worse and my carb craving never went away.  It’s not about insulin response or the effects of artificial sweeteners - it’s about your palette.  Since cutting diet soda, dessert alternatives, etc I haven’t wanted anything sweet or felt the need or desire to cheat.",

I think mostly I'm closer to 100 but I think that's a good guideline\n\nEat protein and fat with carbs - if I snack on a cup of Smartfood (7-8 carbs) I add in some nuts. Nuts are funny to me as I've always avoided them like the plague because Fat Is The Enemy. I've had to adjust that mindset because nuts are a good snack for diabetics though never completely ignore fat content - its still important to eat healthy\n\nIf you eat more carbs than you feel great with drink a LOT of water. And go for a brisk walk - even if its only 15 minutes\n\nEat until you are satisfied - not until you are full\n\nIdeally if you have a testing kit when you eat something you question will cause a spike test 2 hours after that first bite of food - this is how I've learned what I can eat which, crazy, includes 1/4 cup of local farm icecream. \n\nIts less about completely limiting your carb intake and more about portion control. That was arguably the biggest thing for me to internalize\n\nI use Mounjaro once a week and this medicine has caused some of my biggest learning curves. Fried food - even a chicken tender on a big salad - makes me puke. Too much acid? Puke. Too much food in my stomach - and we aren't talking stuffed feeling, we're talking not very much food - makes me puke. Moujaro -and I think Ozempic - slows down your gastric emptying. When I do puke from whatever I did wrong on it I'm usually losing at least 3-4 meals (dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner). I doubt everyone's experiences are the same but nausea is a common Mounjaro side effect which is why I really wanted to mention this.",

        "body": "Hey! Welcome and sorry that you had to join the club! Honestly, my reaction was self pity, and hatred at least for a few days, but it did fuel me to create goals for myself. So while I wouldn't recommend the self loathing bit, I definitely would recommend creating attainable and measurable goals, both short and long term. \n\nFood, I'd say, YMMV, but make sure you can stick with your plan of attack, and again, measure your changes. If things aren't working, adapt and adjust. I went from super strict keto, to low carb, and now to lower carb but higher fibre, and lower sat fats. This changed as my numbers (A1c, cholesterol, weight, etc.) did, and I'm at a point where I feel like how I eat is sustainable for me. \n\nExercise, is definitely great, but find things that you enjoy to do, and will enjoy to do for a long time. Personally, I like golfing and I can combine my walking with that instead of taking a cart. I took up running as a challenge, and did a couple 5k races and a 10k race. I have some weights set up at home, that I use 3 days a week, especially in the winter, even if it's only for 20 mins at a time. Again, if you can find activities, or sports, or active hobbies that you can enjoy over a long period or even lifetime, the easier fitting exercise in your life will be. \n\nModern medicine is great, and GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic are incredible tools if they work for you, and help you achieve your goals. Many want to be unmedicated, but it's essential that you do what's best for you, and don't get discouraged if a medicated path is what's necessary. \n\nOn top of that, this community, particularly, is a great place to share successes, challenges, ask questions, glean information from, and even offer help/advice that you will gain over the course of your diabetic journey. The fact that you're here early on will be a boon to getting you on your way to your goals.",

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes about 10 years ago. Over the past 2 years I have lost over 150 pounds. I still want to drop 40 more pounds to get to my target. I have been watching my diet carefully and exercising 4-5 hours in a typical week. Over the last 4 months my doctor has weaned me off meds as my A1C was 4.6% and 4.5% on my last two visits. He started by having me stop taking Jardiance.  Then on my last visit about 2 weeks ago he had me stop taking Metformin and Victoza. Right now I'm taking no meds for diabetes.  I am on a CGM to monitor the results. From a blood sugar perspective everything appears to be good, except it does seem to take longer that normal for my blood sugar to come back down after a meal.\n\nThe only problem is that my weight loss has stalled.  Right after stopping all meds my weight went up by about 4 pounds.  I think that was primarily due to a change in how my body's digestive functions were working. Now, despite the intense workouts and highly limited low carb meals, I'm not losing weight like I once was. (I'd typically lose 3-5 pounds in a typical week. In the last 2 weeks now I'm up 3 pounds.)\n\nI go back to the doctor in about 3 weeks. At that visit I'd like to talk to him about adding back one of my prescription meds to help resume my weight loss. Of the 3 meds I have taken--Metformin, Victoza, and Jardiance--which one would be the best one to resume from a weight loss perspective? I will talk to my doctor before resuming, but I think if I advocated for one in particular he would likely approve.\n\nOne side challenge is that my long term PCP is retiring at the end of the year so my upcoming visit will be my last one with him.  I start a new doctor in March.",

I put the calibration drift down to changes in hydration though I'm unsure what causes it.\n\nOther factors can affect it temporarily though, such as compression lows at night which happen due to pressure on the sensor if you lie on top of it, and temperature changes such as going out in cold weather or having a hot shower.  If it's still giving you inaccurate readings after a couple of days wear and calibration doesn't fix it you can often get a free replacement sensor, depending on how far off the mark the CGM readings are.",

My A1c hasn’t been “high enough” nor any other health issues bad enough for my insurance to allow the script to be approved. \n\nKaiser Permanente, btw. I have a hate/like preference to this. Like the lower costs, hate the many, many hoops.\n\nI have also been treating my very low hormone levels treated with prescription meds - for Estrogen, Progesterone AND testosterone. As I’ve gotten those balanced better, my daily glucose readings have gotten better, and recent A1C dropped from 7.4 to 6.9. No change in diet or exercise or diabetic medication levels.\n\nI’ve also lost and kept off about 5-7 pounds. (Instead of gaining and losing those repeatedly). I’m also sleeping better, not dealing with carb cravings and have most of my mental clarity back.\n\nHormone levels drop can cause issues for every gender. If you are struggling with symptoms related to an imbalance with hormones, please pursue it and get it checked. It might be the key to gaining success in treating t2d.\n\n",

A CGM technically could be used in some places for diagnosis; however the culture is strongly oriented around measuring A1C so CGMs normally are not approved for that purpose, nor are doctors trained to use them that way. A1C shows overall blood glucose over a long time. CGMs will show how your body is responding to food; but hitting 220 glucose could just be pigging out on candy or drinking sugar cane juice. So with knowledge and context a lot of trained professionals and look at the CGM data and see clear diabetes. But still in most places health insurance will require the A1C  as seen by a doctor to pay for treatment. \n\nI do think that in the next 15 years it is likely that people will spend some time each year with a CGM if they are at risk of diabetes. However the A1C test is extremely cheap so I doubt that the \"rules\" and normal behavior will switch much. \n\nDo understand, it cost potentially 2000 dollars a month to be on these things 10 years ago.  Most doctors I have talked to are either in that mindset or use them all the time because they know they are affordable now. \n\nAll this said, I would have to go review current applications research: but I think prediabetes would be more visible on a CGM than via A1C measurement. So its possible pre-diabetes in at risk populations will get an alternate diagnostic criteria based on CGM data.",

What usually shows up are things like high fasting or overnight readings 130–180+ post-meal spikes well over 200 that take hours to come down, or, in early T1D, wild swings even with small meals. Seeing those patterns often pushes people to get labs done, which ends up confirming diabetes.",

I cry when I buy shoes for several reasons, cost is one, and the number of issues I have purchasing them is another.\n\nIf you have arch pain, look into orthotics if they're covered by your insurance or by health care, literally life changing.\n\nNicer quality shoes are around that $100-200 mark (in Canada, which has similar exchange to AUD). The shoes I normally buy are more than that, but I have tried on a lot of pairs by the time I give up and spend the amount I do. See if you can go to a specialized store to get them fit if possible, it will narrow brands down (I can't wear Hoka or Nike). Try a specialty walking shoe store or running shoe store (Pace in Sydney shoes up in a quick Google). The specialty stores, at least here, have people who know several brands better than the general shoe or sports stores at malls and many of them have solid advice.\n\nI hate runners, but have had to go to specialty stores for walking shoes, hiking boots, and ski boots. Better experience and results than the mall stores each time. Bonus points if they know a cobbler or have an on-site one who can help with fit, but cobblers are getting rare.\n\nMephisto make good (but quite expensive, I cry when I buy) walking shoes that have kept me walking for about 8 years.

        "body": "You don't have to buy there, but go to a New Balance and use their foot/ankle scanner.  I went to several and it was very consistent with issues I have.  Gives you a better idea of size and a type of shoe in the sense of ankle or pressure areas.\n\nUse a string/floss/piece of paper and get a line from center of shoe heel to center of toe.  If sole is equal both sides, the shoe is neutral.  More on the inside of the shoe, pronation.  More on the outside of sole, supination.  Sometimes your foot issue can be you're wearing the wrong shoe for your feet.  The scan helps with this.  Any shoe you have which doesn't work for your pressure/walk style, get rid of it.  \n\nSo the cheap shoes are for men under 180 pounds and women under 140 pounds.  You can get away with cheat materials they use on these.  If you're over on weight (not asking), the cushioning, toe box, ankle box will be sturdier (obviously all brands aren't the same) to support the pressure you're putting on your feet.  If you don't plan to buy several pairs, you should get a solid shoe to last a while.  \nArch support -- scan will help with your arch type and help you either pick a shoe or the right support.  Very key, especially for people over the weights above.  \nI wish you good luck in your search for a proper shoe.  If you're going to spend $200 on a shoe that will last 6-12 months, spend the $200ish on (just my honest opinion) something like Z-Coil.  The shoes last about 10 years (I get 8-10 including the laces last that long), sping/heel is easy to replace, they take 1/2 the impact out of foot strike so you basically spend $20-25/year for a pair of shoes.  There are other shoes like G-Defy, but I haven't tried them or can vouch how long they last.",

Many in the US have what they call ifit not the video workout ifit it just measures you walking stride, how you stand - basically your feet standing in 3d mode.  So they can determine what type of stuff is going  on qith your walking &amp;feet. Like pronation - do you have it and how bad it is. Do you need a rise step. Do you walk straight or lean your feet one way or the other - like knee knotted or toes pointing together.  What you stride looks and feels like.  So after all that they will recommend shoe brands and styles that work best for your feet and activities.  So for me hoka bondi or NB 880 worked for me best.",

Now with this new diagnosis I am struggling a bit to adjust, i am doing my part with exercise &amp; I know to eat more greens and not the starchy ones I believe, stay away from bread and carbs, no sugary anything and if I’m on the go I’m trying to find fast food places and meals from them that won’t hurt me too much if eaten and I just want to ask how did you deal with some of these issues when first diagnosed? Do you have any advice? \nI honestly miss sodas more than anything and was wondering if sugar free options were okay? Are sugar free options for desserts okay also? Can I still eat cheese? Is crystal light okay for replacing sodas? I’m just a bit overwhelmed by this new news and still am trying to figure out a plan and how to deal with all of this. \nAnything helps, thank you.",

Where I live in was able to attend digital and in person classes as well as booking in time with a nutritionist. \n\nAlso acquiring a prescription for CGMs will help huge. This thing was my worst enemy at first but it's a huge help now. Do lots of research on how they work too since they dont always explain the ins and outs of them. \n\nWhen it comes to fast food I try to cut back but if course thats not always an option. What I do now is find the most protein and fats and lowest amount of carbs. If I go to McDonald's I grab 2 double cheese burgers, remove ketchup, add mayo (removes sugar from ketchup) and then remove 1 bun from each, combine them to make a quad cheese burger. Alternatively if there's a quick chicken wing joint I'll get wings and veggies and my numbers barely move. \n\nI have sugar free sodas once in a while and they dont affect me. I try and stick to water and maybe a coffee without sugar. Anything sugar free doesnt hit me at all including the rare sugar free energy drink. Green and black tea is decent too i just add 0 sugar creamer and sweetener.\n\nYou're already doing the right thing by asking questions so good job there. Its a long road but it's about progress not perfection. You're gonna slip, have good days and bad, but they all pass just do your best the next day. I've been through the new diagnosis shock, depression, fear of food but I learned what affects me and how and almost 8 months in im under control and calm. You'll get there like the rest of us",

I'm down 40 lbs, and I feel great aside from getting lightheaded sometimes when I stand up, and my hands tingling if I lay on an arm or too long. \n\nI went for my blood draw yesterday around noon and hadn't eaten since 6pm the evening before (needed to be fasted.) I did a finger prick right before I walked in and it showed 91. Which is a new low for me, I've been hovering around 100. But the glucose level that came back from my bloodwork ended up being 69, so that's a frustrating difference, and also annoying because I've spent the past 3 months working to lower my fasting glucose, and now it reads too low? \n\nSome of my other numbers are high now. In those 3 months my LDL went from 109 to 148 (normal range is 0-130.) My diet pretty much consists of eggs, chicken, turkey, pork, salads, and lots of cheese and nuts. I'll also have a slice of ezekiel with avocado or peanut butter (just peanuts) a few times a week, and an occasional whey protein shake with unsweetened almond milk. So I'm thinking it might be the excessive cheese and nuts, maybe along with the pork? I'd really love any thoughts about this as I try to map out what my diet looks like for the next 3 months to lower my LDL. (If it helps, total cholesterol is 191 with a normal range being &lt;=200. Triglycerides are 56 and HDL is 32, both within normal ranges.)\n\nThe other one that is high is Anion Gap at 17.2 (normal range 6-15.) I looked into this one and it seems it could be high because my body was fasted and I'm ketosis, which I think is actually a good thing... should I worry about this one? \n\nEdit to add: I've also been eating a lot of beef sticks/turkey sticks. I don't want to leave that out as it may be contributing to my high LDL.",

The dosing guidelines also say that you can increase your dose past 5mg as needed for additional blood sugar control. This can all be found on their website: https://mounjaro.lilly.com/hcp/getting-patients-started \n\nIt might be worth it to get a second opinion.

If so, you probably need to go up to the next level because your body has gotten used to it. The idea is to keep increasing doses each month until your body adjusts. \n\nPersonally the 5mg is good for me to stay on because I’m not super hungry so there no need to restrict what I’m eating to help with my blood sugars.

I've tested my blood glucose once or twice a day for most days. While I tested my glucose levels, I thought I would expect a similar number if I pricked my fingers multiple times but I've consistently been getting readings of eight to 20 or more mg/dl during the same pricking session. I use the True Metrix blood glucose monitor if you guys are wondering. Im guessing one issue could be that my machine might not be reading right. To find this out i went online and bough the True Metrix glucose meter control solutions. These solutions should be arriving next week and I will test my monitor for accuracy. If I find the monitor is accurate next week, then what might be causing the different readings? Does the quantity of blood entering the test strip affect the results? Does pricking different fingers affect the results? I doubt its the fingers since its the same blood but I could be wrong. \n\nAre you guys also experiencing this? How many times are you guys pricking your fingers during the same session? I like to do it twice to see what the number says because I dont trust one solo reading. Thanks!",

If you go into calorie deficit for an extended period your body will try to hold onto fat reserves through metabolic adaptation.  One of the effects I observed via Fitbit and Garmin fitness trackers is reduced resting heart rate.  Heartbeats burn some calories.  I also experienced cold hands and feet sometimes, which is apparently the body trying to save on calories burned to keep your body warm, and while I only felt truly faint once or twice I did regularly feel drained of energy, sluggish, on days when I was actively trying to lose weight fast.  Also constipated, which is apparently the body slowing down digestion to try to extract as much energy from food in the gut as possible.\n\nAround an hour after even one big meal and I'd feel fine again and my resting heart rate would go back up after being well fed for a couple of days.

I didn’t realize that I was critically low. It was just before lunch. The one fellow was just about to call an ambulance. He offered me a candy of some type and while I wasn’t much better, I was starting to come out of my fugue. The other dude told me today that he thought I might have been having a stroke. He led me to the break room to have my lunch. I came back to normal after lunch. \n\nThese dudes are good solid folks, and I am grateful to work with folks who pay attention enough to know that something is not right with me. I thanked them profusely today for being good folks, and for looking out for me. \n\nI did also point out that if I am acting off again, to remind me of the juice boxes I always have with me.

The good thing is you might not have to stay on them forever and you can get a cgm if you end up on insulin. I bet they advise some sort of long lasting insulin. I was on 30u of Lantus once a day at first.\n\nI found out in January. 12.7 a1c. My glucose was in the high 900's. DKA and a 4 day ICU stay. With an immediate change in diet and started getting in as many steps a day as a could. Eventually working up to 20 to 25k steps 5 days a week. Plus 3 fast and 1 long lasting insulin shots a day and 2000mg of metformin. I brought my A1c down to 9.8 in 30 days. 90 days later I had a 5.2 a1c. Resting 98. Came off the fast acting at that time. 90 days later. Another 5.2 and dropped the long lasting and stepped down to 1000mg of metformin. About 6 weeks later. I was going hypo just from the Metformin and excerise. So we stopped that. The more you keep the healthy lifestyle the more your body can heal as much as it can.\n\nYou seem to be in a situation where you could potentially do what ive done. Maybe not but finding the right combination will be worth it in the long run.\n\nI'm making a big assumption with this next thougt. So I apologize in advance if Im wrong. The title of this saying, \"You're ready\". Took me as, you didn't want to take meds and have come to see a need. It takes a lot to admit they need meds from some and if that is you. Congratulations for making a hard decision.\n\nI would only suggest more cardio. A 30 minute brisk walk might get you around 2k steps, give or take. Depending on your stride. I personally take a 30 minute walk 3 times a day. 5 days a week. One in the morning before work. One right after work and o e after dinner. With just normal moving around each day that gets me around 12 to 15k a day. For me personally. I got much better overall results with mostly cardio. Walking, kayaking. Bike rides. I eat a lot of protein to maintain muscle mass. 100 grams or more a day. \n\nThats just my .02 though. You do what works for you",

Back in July I unexpectedly found out I was diabetic after finding a high amount of sugar in my urine and being urged to go to the ER for immediate bloodwork. \n\nI’ve been put on 5mg of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) the last month or so and have been keeping myself active between my walking commute and my post-dinner walks (aka my hot girl walks). \n\nI cut down carbs as much as possible, granted my dietitian told me 20g or less for main meals and managed to lose about 20 pounds in about 3 months. Admittingly, being put on medication had allowed me to be a little more lenient with myself but I still watch carbs and sugar intake. \n\nI’ve learned from both my doctor and dietitian that restricting myself from foods that I love is not the answer. Allowing myself to have things I love like ramen every blue moon is ok, and this has helped my mental health so much. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed I was having constant mental breakdowns. I felt like I couldn’t handle this diagnosis, despite being told a 7.6 isn’t horrible. But knowing how far I’ve come in such a short time, makes me think I can really do this for the long run. It’s not going to be all positive, and as my dietitian told me, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nBut my point is, I wanted to share my progress to show that things *do* get better, even when you think they won’t.

One in particular, was a 2 day delay in getting a prescription switched from one to the another. As one didn't have what they needed. Reminded me of an experience I had.\n\nI spent most my life living in Southern California. Lived in Manhattan for some years. Always hated pharmacies. Big chains rule in places like that. Since moving to a very small town in Ohio. You notice little differences that end up becoming HUGE differences. \n\nThere is a CVS on the corner right across the street from a locally owned pharmacy. Couldnt be in more direct competition with each other if they tried. After my ICU stay for DKA. I had my prescriptions sent to the local pharmacy. Got there, tried to use my HSA card and it wouldn't work on their machine.  Walked across the street switched the prescription and card still didn't work. Ugh.\n\nI start making phone calls. Next thing, im getting a call from the local pharmacy. Instead of letting me just go. They had been in the phone trying figure out from their end what might have been wrong. They actually told me what to do to fix the issue. Of course I went back to them. For about 6 months despite every prescription I have written to the local place. Somehow CVS still got it first and I have to have to switched. Even after going into CVS twice to tell them to never fill my prescriptions. I dont even know how they call it \"FILLED\" if I never picked it up. \n\nThis pharmacist goes above and beyond for me every time I walk in the door. They literally have two 10 ft rows of product to sell. Not one soda or bag of chips. No candy. Although they do sell locally harvested raw honey. Just prescription drugs and useful medical products. If you need something from one of those shelves. They walk out and grab it for you, if you missed it. If they dont carry it and you actually use it a lot. They'll carry it for you. \n\nLong-winded way to say. Give the small guy a shot. They just might knock your socks off. They dont let me have issues with my meds. They take that on, or at least give me good advise on how to get it down. We all know how important meds can be to us and the little guy took away my huge worries. ",

Then, what you see is the result of that medication... each acts in a certain way to either cut down glucose conversion or to expel it effectively. \nIf you are seeing improvement after diet changes, you are not giving your body the same type and amount of food to raise sugar as much as before.\nIf you're exercising more, you're just burning more.\n\nIn short, as far as I understand, all address the symptom, not the root cause.\n\nWould love to read expert inshights.

Even used my walking pad for the first time and walked for ever 30 minutes after. After the walk I had 2 handfuls of Costco trail mix which maybe had 4 m&amp;ms total. \n\nI noticed the longer rise last night before bed which never happens so I chugged about a liter or water and decided to do another workout (squats, sit ups and push ups) before bed in the hopes of dropping it and it just made it go above 12. \n\nI know this happens depending what you eat before bed especially but I thought I did it all right. I took my meds with dinner (1000 mg metformin) and worked out with a fairly balanced meal im familiar with. \n\nIf there's any decent advice for what to do or what could cause this id really appreciate it",

I didn’t have any major symptoms, and my glucose levels are now fairly stable after making some diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nI have a busy schedule (10 AM–6 PM), so I usually work out early morning or evening. Right now, I walk 10k–15k steps daily and do some light dumbbell workouts at home.\n\nMy goal is to lower my HbA1c when I recheck it after 3 months, while also losing fat and getting toned.\n\nI’m unsure whether this routine is enough for good results or if I should join a gym for faster progress.\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve improved their HbA1c and fitness — did walking alone work for you, or did gym workouts make a bigger difference?\n\n\n",

All of your activity and exercise helps grow your deficit, but it's not burning as much as you think. It's usually over-estimated.\n\nThe gym won't necessarily give you faster progress, but it will give you more options beyond your handweights. There's also a layer of social pressure that keeps you going further than you would at home, especially without distractions. \n\nTo control your diabetes, it sounds like you're doing what you should.

A day of working out will keep my numbers low for several days afterwards.  The key is to workout for a full 60 minutes, otherwise a shorter workout will actually cause your numbers to rise, not fall.  A 10 to 15 minute walk 30 to 60 minutes after meal is also huge and blunts the spike from a meal.  It won't stop a rise completely, but it does wonders.

That's probably for the best as it was essentially untamed gluttony. Drinking straight fruit juice is one step away from drinking sugar water. The taste of sodas have been on the decline for years now. For the most part, 80% of what I should avoid ingesting was terrible to begin with. \n\nNot being able to gorge on fruit and avoiding traditionally healthy breads like sourdough kind've sucks but realistically type 2 diabetes just forces you to live a lifestyle that everyone should be doing in the first place: eating whole foods that include primarily vegetables and full proteins while doing enough exercise to build and maintain muscle. Carbs and sugars are entirely unnecessary for a healthy individual to need to consume, they're purely for luxury or if in extreme cases you'd need carbs for fuel doing extended physical labor, which if we're being honest here, a majority of type 2 diabetics aren't in that situation.

Its resistance to sugars is so messed up that your glucose goes high. \n\nI have diabetes because of a family history of diabetes. The food choices I might have made may have contributed to poorer health, but it isn't the cause of it. The cause is that I genetically carried diabetes. So when it took effect, I wasn't able to regulate my thrist and hunger well. I craved more salt, sugar, starches, and carbs and in higher amounts.\n\nMaybe I'm off, I'm not a doctor, but this is my understanding of it.

I decided to stop because that was the goal.. in October I got careless and started eating whatever I wanted.. I am now suffering the consequences of that.. my FBS every morning has been 5.7-6.4 range for a week now (before it was only between 4-5.5). I stopped eating sweets and high carbs recently but I’m scared that I did this again to myself and I really regret it. 😞 Also I’m thinking should I take metformin again? I know I should ask the doctor but he gave me the decision last time (I recently moved to a rural area where there’s only 1 clinic so no other options around) \n\nThank you in advance for any input or advice.

    "selftext": "Hi all - my father (age 72) recently stopped taking the medication Januvia for his type 2 diabetes after having a reaction to the medication. Long story short, he was on Januvia for 6 years - suddenly had some all over body itching as a result of low kidney function due to the medication. His doctor took him off the Januvia suddenly. Just like that, after 6 years, stopped taking it. Hasn’t replaced the medication with anything else. This was about 4 weeks ago. Since then he’s been suffering from blurry vision, light headedness, low appetite, feeling “off balance”, and just not himself. He went to the ER last week.. they did a CT, blood work, etc.. all the things that came back normal. We say one of his PCP’s partners today and she thought he might have positional vertigo. We were able to do a same day with a physical therapist who after doing a few maneuvers said it is not vertigo. His blood sugars are testing back in range. They fluctuate but nothing out of what is considered ordinary.  \n\nHas anyone else stopped Januvia suddenly and have had similar experiences with symptoms? What did you do? When did it subside? We are starting to wonder if his body just needs some time to regulate and get back to normal. We’ve done all the things and have found out a lot about what isn’t wrong with him… but it’s easy to see he’s frustrated and anxious. He’s an incredibly healthy person - eats well, goes to the YMCA 2-3 times a week to lift weights and walk, and does all the things to be healthy. He’s been staying home, not going much of anywhere, etc…  and I just want to help him. \n\nLet me know if anyone else has a similar story! Thank you! 😊 ",

First, let me address hbA1c. hbA1c, despite the common belief, does not measure glucose or average glucose. It measures the amount of glycated (damaged) red blood cells in a sample. So just rephrase the question: is it bad to reduce the amount of damage I'm doing to my red blood cells? Obviously not. \n\nRapid reduction in glucose can aggravate neuropathy, cause temporary changes in vision that can last up to a month, aggravate retinopathy or, in severe cases, cause NAION, a very serious eye condition. \n\nShould you try to maintain high glucose levels and reduce slowly? That's a question for a doctor who knows your history. For me, I dropped from hbA1c of 10.6 to 4.8 in 111 days. FGL from 309 to 85. I did have temporary changes to my eyesight that lasted almost 3 weeks. That can be scary but I was familiar with the physiology before I started getting my body on the right track.",

Before you adjust the insulin doses, it's important to be prepared how to treat hypoglycemia, if not already familiar.

It takes some trial and error to dial this in. I can share that my insulin resistance developed later, post 50s. It’s something we had to dial in after decades of low doses and good A1C.\n\nEdit. I see you are in India. I have no idea what the healthcare system is like or availability of specialists dr.

The next time it probably will take you out-of-range.\n\n**Edited to add:**  As a general rule I care less about spikes than I do about going out-of-range, but I also keep a pretty narrow range for myself (80 to 130 mg/dL), so any spike is pretty much guaranteed to take me out-of-range unless I was starting out-of-range-low (under 80).

    "selftext": "Guys and gals, firstly I’m sorry if I’m not allowed to post here. I do not have diabetes. However, I watched my grandfather slowly die at what I consider to be a young age (62) of complications from diabetes. I am currently 27, about to turn 28. \n\nI hit a phase for the last couple years where I just didn’t care about anything. Didn’t care about my health and taking care of myself or making decisions that will prove fruitful in the future. I went through phases of getting a milkshake every other night, or eating a pint of ice cream every 2 days, and in love with sweets. Just eating trash like a true American piece of garbage. Also, I know diabetes has an effect on the feet, and I’ve always been cognizant of a weird feeling in my feet, almost numb and cold at weird times. \n\nI am uneducated when it comes to this, as you can tell. \n\nI went the doc the other day and my hemoglobin A1c returned at 5.1, to my surprise. I kinda just figured I was diabetic, or at the very least, pre, because of my terrible dietary habits and my hereditary disposition. Part of the worry worm in me wonders if there’s a particular circumstance that may be manipulating the results, but I’ll believe them. \n\nAgain, sorry if I’m not allowed to post here. But I’m just wondering how I can protect myself now to make sure that I can live a full life of health. If anyone has any advice or insight on how to take care of myself moving forward, would be awesome. Always curious to learn. Thank you ",

If you feel that you are predisposed to diabetes because of your family history, it's good to stay on top of this. \n\n\nYou may want to have your A1C rechecked on a regular basis, such as every 3 months or every 6 months, whatever your doctor recommends. Your doctor can make a diagnosis based on blood tests and possibly urine tests, your family history and any symptoms you might mention. Your A1C value is a key indicator in making the diagnosis.\n\n\nPeople diagnosed with diabetes need to watch their carbohydrate intake carefully and stay away from junk foods and foods with useless carbohydrates and little else in them. Diet, exercise, hydration, medications, sleep and stress management all can affect blood glucose levels, so all of these are important.\n\n\nYour doctor can provide you with a referral to see a dietician, if needed. Your insurance may pay for that visit if it is considered medically necessary. \n\n\nIf you are diagnosed as pre-diabetic or diabetic, your doctor can give you a referral to see an endocrinologist.

It affects everything: circulatory system from heart to the small tissues in your feet, impedes your healing abilities from sores or illness, eyes and kidneys bc of the damage in small tissues. \nSo if you don’t get checkups to know you have an issue, or don’t do what you need to do to get your sugar close to normal most of the time then complications are inevitable. It doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy cake once in a while. But you mostly have to be in control. When treating diabetes there are other medications that show decrease in health complications if also taken. For example you might not have cholesterol or blood pressure issues, but the Dr should put you on those meds also for tissue protection. \n\nAlso it’s entirely possible that you can exercise enough and a pint of ice cream every other day doesn’t do damage at all. It’s about your overall health/exercise/ ability of your body to process what you put into it. At minimum 150 minutes a week of cardio for cardiovascular health. If you can add muscle with some weight exercises your metabolism will work better. If you in general follow the MyPlate for eating. There’s a lot of good science behind these recommendations.",

My mom, dad, brother, 3 of 4 grandparents, and at least 8 other family members of all shapes, sizes and health, have diabetes. If it's not MODY, then I don't need any scientific studies to tell me that there is a genetic link to type 2. \n\nMy point: this is all about YOUR health and your diagnosis. Listen to the professionals. Find an endocrinologist and seek advice from a certified, registered dietitcan. Do not listen to influencers or \"nutritionists\".",

        "body": "No. Prediabetes, if you are type 1, may indicate that you're in a honeymoon period, but it doesn't just \"turn into\" type 1. The honeymoon period just means that your pancreas hasn't compeltely failed (yet) and still produces some insulin. Type 2 does not turn into type 1. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where the body's cells attack the pancreas, thus it doesn't make insulin required to surivive. \n\nThere are 26 types and variations of diabetes, so it's very common that a person is misdiagnosed at first, so sometimes people are diagnosed as type 2, but then they get the bloodwork done and realize it's type 1. Same thing for MODY (genetic diabetes), which requires a specific genetic test. \n\nType 2 can burn out the pancreas, whether from not taking care of the diabetes or from being undiagnosed, or other reasons, like metabolic disease, such as PCOS. Genetics play a massive role in type 2 as well. Once a pancreas burns out the beta cells, the pancreas can't produce insulin that's needed for the (often) insulin resistant body. So, many type 2 diabetics will need insulin to survive. \n\nThe key to any diagnosis is to be PROPERLY diagnosed. Ask for a referral to an endocrinologist. As for autoimmune blood tests like c-peptide, GAD, etc. and make sure you are getting the proper diagnosis. Fasting glucose of 93 indicates normal fasting BS, but there are too many factors that need to be evaluated to see if you're diabetic.",

I would also be requesting to slowly increase the dosage rather than rush through every 4 weeks. Diabetics can sometimes respond better to certain doses, such as having better blood sugar numbers on 2.5 that 5. Plus there's a maximum dose that you want to save as long as possible. \n\nI was diagnosed last August at 11.4. I made major lifestyle changes to my diet and exercise in addition to the Mounjaro, and a year late, I'm 80 pounds lighter and at 4.9. My cholesterol is now normal too. But that being said, my doctor didn't move up to the next dose every 4 weeks and instead let my body dictate that. Obviously the results have been positive. \n\nMy experience is that I lost more weight before Mounjaro just waiting for it be approved than I did in the first 6 weeks on Mounjaro. It was working on my blood sugar and inflammation, and weight loss wasn't seen for a hot second despite being things \"right.\" \n\nHonestly, the risk of a high A1C trumps any risks with a GLP-1 unless you're allergic. Every time I was frustrated, I remembered that my goal is to control the disease, not lose weight. That perspective has helped me keep things going when I wanted to quit.",

I don't have a thyroid anymore so I take levothyroxine and, in the 6 months between lab draws, I had moved into the hyperthyroid range pretty significantly, so now we're playing the adjust-the-dose-and-recheck game until I'm back at normal. \n\nAll that said, there are quite a few people for whom Mounjaro hasn't been all it was hyped up to be, so take what I said with a grain of salt and know everyone is different. Some people have bad side effects, some of those have had the side effects go away while some haven't. It just really varies from person to person and dose to dose.\n\nI do suggest talking with your doctor about starting the metformin first and getting used to it because it can cause stomach issues at the start, so starting it and Mounjaro at the same time may increase stomach upset. Alternately, they may prefer doing it in the reverse order or want you to try both at the same time. I am most definitely not a doctor, so talk to yours before deciding anything, and find a new one if yours won't listen to your concerns or work with you on timing new meds.",

    "selftext": "Cliff notes of my journey: \n\n7 years ago, I was told I’m diabetic during an ER visit for an appendectomy. BS: 655; A1C: 14.7. 25YO male at diagnosis. \n\nFollowed up with a PCP who didn’t care and just told me to take Metformin. No other testing done. Said T2 because I was overweight and younger. \n\nPCP retired and new PCP took over. I brought up my concerns and some slight medication adjustments were made. Finally put on a CGM. No other major changes. Lantus, glipizide, sitagliptin. This PCP said I could be a T1.5 but we never did any other forms of testing. \n\nI’ve never taken it super serious, just took the meds and lived my life. A1C last checked at 6.7. PCP says good enough. She basically matches my energy of indifference. \n\nLast few months, I’ve decided to be serious about this finally. I’m diabetic and I need to take charge of it. So at this point, I’m needing some suggestions. What tests need to be done to have an actual diagnosis: T2, LADA, or MODY? What should I ask about medications? I want less medications and I’m happy to work out daily. I’ve started to transition to a Mediterranean type diet and am happy with those changes. \n\nCurrently, when I try to work out my BS tanks and I’m scared of pushing further so I will stop. I’m not sure how I can improve physically if I can’t work out. I used to be an active, outdoor physical guy before the diagnosis. \n\nThanks to everyone for any words of wisdom!\n\nEdit: I am in the overweight category. I know weight loss is heavily diet influenced but I also would like to be able to work out daily. Currently, if I even walk at a medium pace for more than 15 minutes, my BS will drop by 75-100. It’s wild and scary feeling.\n\nUpdate: thanks for all the advice from people. I’m working on getting an Endocrinologist ASAP. This whole experience was prompted when I realized I can’t even answer what type of diabetic I am. I’m probably type 2 but no doctor/endo has ever defined it for me. I’ll look into all the advice and get in to an Endocrinologist! ",

        "body": "Um, if you take Lantus for basal insulin but nothing for bolus insulin (when eating carbs and correcting high BS), that’s super weird. If you crash after a workout, that’s usually type1. I don’t believe in type 1.5. Either your pancreas produces insulin, or it doesn’t. But CGMs and basal insulin are usually for type 1 ((which I am). \n\nThe majority of type 2 ppl can theoretically cure themselves of type 2 diabetes. Not all, but most (some tyoe2 cases are hereditary). Your DIABETES DOCTOR (not primary), which could be an endo, will advise on tests. But if your pancreas produces insulin, you can kick diabetes by doing 4 things. \n\nThe first is changing your lifestyle. Meaning you need a full overhaul of your mindset so you make the same right decisions 95% of the time. Meaning COMMITMENT AND CONSISTENCY with the goal being to eventually get off ALL DRUGS and CGM. There are books about people curing their type 2 diabetes so feel free to read/confirm this is true.\n\n2 of these are kind of subsidiaries of the first 1: diet and exercise. This is where a lot of tyoe2 ppl give up, mostly because they already have a lifestyle of eating bad and not exercising to begin with, which caused them to become diabetic. Veggies and low carbs are a necessity. Make a limit of X amount of carbs per meal. Cutting out bread and pasta is probably a requirement. Regular soda and regular juice is a NEVER. Anything that will spike your glycemic index is a NEVER unless you’re low. On the days you workout, you can eventually take less lantus and also once you establish a pattern you can take carbs during the workout to keep you level. If you’re still  crashing, make sure you pair whatever carb you have with protein. BUT YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR CARDIO DAILY. This might just be walking to start, but no skipping days. \n\nThe last thing is regulate stress and positivity. These are underrated but vital. My immune system attacked my pancreas because I was the most stressed out I’ve ever been, and that’s what caused me to become diabetic. My immune system was trying to protect me….. from me. So make sure you limit stress and stay positive. Usually I’d troll ppl who don’t take this condition seriously who post their problems on Reddit but i see you at least are working on trying to better yourself. Don’t give up, stay strong",

Your a1c is in a decent place right now. It could be lower and will likely get there as you are able to exercise more freely. That being said, even with the drops during workouts you may not want to adjust meds until you speak with an endo. You aren’t on fast acting insulin so any adjustments may solve the exercise drop but you could end up running higher at other points during the day. For the time being, you might try sipping on some full sugar Gatorade/powerade/whathaveyou during your workout to mitigate the drop. Alternatively, you could have more carbs before working out to see if that keeps the drop during your workout more reasonable. \n\nA lot of dealing with diabetes is trial and error unfortunately, there are very few universal truths that work for every person every time. While working out, make sure you have fast sugar available to avoid true lows (under 70) and you can also tweak the low alarm on your CGM so it goes off at 80 or 90 which should give you some extra time to deal with any fast drops.",

        "body": "I have a number of recommendations for you. First ask for pcp for a referral to an endocrinologist. Once you get that referral depending on the area you live and your insurance your first scheduled appointment with endo will likely be somewhere between two weeks and three months. While you are waiting to get in you need to do the following until you endocrinologist can give you specific guidance: eliminate sodas and drinks containing sugar or high fructose corn syrup. The high fructose corn syrup that is in foods and beverages is actually worse than natural sugar believe it or not. I recommend switching to teas with Splenda. Watch closely food labels that indicate the  food contains high fructose corn  syrup. If you’re not using a CGM you need to check your blood sugar levels four times a day. If you do have a CGM you should do a regular finger stick at least once a day to make sure your CGM is properly calibrated. Your endocrinologist might want to put you on a injectable drug like Ozempic as it can help you with both diabetic issues and with weight loss. The thing is that before you start such medication you need to first make adjustments to your eating habits as to reduce some of the side effects of the medication. Honestly though your endocrinologist will probably put you first on fast acting and slow acting insulin before trying something else. If he or she does not want to do insulins or Ozempic type drug for you can ask if you could take Janumet instead  of just Metformin. Janumet actually contains two drugs sitagliptin and metformin. The combination of those two drugs typically helps your body better regulate your blood sugar levels. Now one important note both Ozempic and Junumet will require insurance preaproval and both are expensive especially if you have high copayments for Medicines. Also most insurance companies will only allow you to either take Ozempic or Junment not both because of costs. Your doctor should have been doing an A1C on you at least once if not twice a year. If you PCP was not doing that I recommend getting a new pcp after you see your new endo doctor first. Best wishes",

Has about 2g less carbs and 3g more fiber than this brand, but I’ve never had these. If you’ve ever tried chickpea pasta, how does the taste and texture compare to these?? \n\nIt can be hard to get past the texture of certain protein pasta shapes, but finding one I like has been so awesome. Don’t have to stress as much about spikes, and you get a pretty substantial amount of fiber in depending on the brand and what you pair it with. Awesome",

First it was adding in cardio and then slowly building that habit with weight lifting too. Now I'm definitely building muscle, even on 10 mg. \n\nDon't worry about getting shredded. You won't. As you build muscle and lose fat, more muscles will show through. Like right now, my quads like amazing. But that's a fire cry from shredded. It takes a heck of a lot of work to get to that point, and you're not going to look unnatural. Trust me on this - it's going to take a few more levels of effort to reach even close to that. \n\nYou're not going to start lifting and in a few months suddenly look like a body builder, if you catch my drift.   \n  \n**And** because you have the health-first mindset, you don't have the same rush to the finish line. You can take your time and focus on you. It's a nice little bonus that you're getting your diabetes under control, your weight until control, your mental health under control, your diet until control, and finding a new love for exercise that you never knew existed.",

I personally like Jocko Molk for protein shakes, taste is great not gritty and sweeter is monk fruit so no sugar spike. Perfect for a diabetic. As long as you get enough protein you shouldn’t lose muscle (the muscle loss is largely caused but not enough protein in your diet and limited meal sizes). \n\nPersonally I love the med and its downsides are pretty minimal for me.",

    "selftext": "For those familiar with LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults), we've all heard that cases of LADA are frequently, if not almost always, initially diagnosed as T2. Follow-up antibody and C-peptide tests eventually point to LADA, whenever they're done.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is: has anyone heard of the reverse—being diagnosed as LADA but with strong evidence in favor of T2?\n\nMy context, briefly: Dx T2 last summer with A1C of 7.1. Have been on a low dose of metformin ever since, which, combined with diet changes, immediately sent me right down to 5.8. Added a GLP-1 a few months ago and my A1C is now 5.4. No insulin, no complications. In a word, fabulous.\n\nI asked to see an endocrinologist at the start of 2025 and tests showed high levels of C-peptide, which means I was overproducing insulin, likely thanks to insulin resistance. GADA, IAA, and ZnT8 were all negative, and I have no other indicators of any autoimmune disease. Follow-up C-peptides have all shown slightly elevated or normal levels.\n\nThe lone positive was IA-2, but it was a very weak positive, not far past the threshold.\n\nAll this has me wondering if it's really LADA—the only evidence *for* is that weak IA-2; everything else seems to argue *against* LADA. From my research into it, people who present with LADA often are normal weight, experience unexplained weight loss, and have abnormally low C-peptide, often having difficulty controlling their sugars. None of that describes me. Further, GADA positivity is far and away the most common marker for autoimmune diabetes, and I'm GADA negative.\n\nMy endo has said that I might be right in that I'm truly T2 rather than LADA, but that the only thing to do is to monitor my insulin production over time to see if it starts to decline.\n\nI wouldn't split hairs over the LADA/T2 distinction so much, but it has insurance implications for GLP-1 coverage in the immediate term, and will eventually matter to the trajectory of my treatment, so I'm invested in trying to tease out the \"truth\", inasmuch as it can be ascertained.\n\nAnyway, I really appreciate any thoughts you have to offer!",

When I was first diagnosed, I spent a LOT of time testing , a lot more often than the Dr. suggested, sometimes as often as 8 or 9 times a day.   I also kept copious notes for a while so I could track patterns.  To make this less monetarily painful,  I  picked up a secondary tester for this at Walmart since their testers and strips (Relion) are cheap.  This is how I figured out that, while other people react very badly to corn, I do not.  Corn tortillas and popcorn are actually pretty safe for me in moderation, probably because I have eaten corn bread all my life so my body grew up adapting to it.  I also consider dried beans a fairly safe food in moderation.  Another trick that can be useful: some carbs (pasta being a big one) break down slower depending on if it was just cooked, cooked and then cooled, or cooked, cooled and then reheated.  Reheated spaghetti has very little effect on my blood sugar while just prepared pasta will make it skyrocket.  Boil-in-bag rice tends to be safer for me than traditionally prepared rice.  Finally, \"fattier carbs\" are safer than plain ones., i.e. cheesecake is a better option than birthday cake.  I now test once a day, per doc's recommendations; although, I will occasionally do a day of many tests just to check in and see if anything has changed.",

Don't eat the rice.\n\n\n\nHummus is OK, as long as it is rich and high in fat, and you eat small servings and use vegetables to dip into it, not pita chips.\n\n\nCheese is basically carb-free and is a good source of protein and calcium. It's a frequent component of our diet. Cheese does contain a lot of saturated fat, though, so it should be eaten strictly in moderation if your cholesterol level is a concern for you. Low fat or part skim cheeses are healthier from a standpoint of fat.\n\n\nMy husband makes us grilled cheese sandwiches on 100% whole wheat bread. There are carbs in rhe bread but also fiber and protein. This combined with the fat and protein in the cheese help to slow duwn digestion and avoid a blood glucose spike.\n\n\nOatmeal can be eaten as long as it's made from rolled oats or steel-cut oats, and not quick-cooking oats or instant oatmeal. The process of cooking oatmeal, refrigerating it until cold, then reheating it the next day creates \"resistant starch\" in it. The resistant starch is less likely to create a spike in blood glucose.\n\n\nFor me, nuts and peanuts don't spike my blood glucose. Again, the fat, protein and fiber help in them slow everything down. Buy peanut butter with no sugar added, or grind your own like you can do at Winco Foods. Everyone metabolizes food differently, though. Some foods cause a spike in some people while others don't.\n\n\nPastries and desserts are typically carbohydrate bombs. Avoid sugar and recipes with sugar added, whether white or brown sugar. Avoid white flour or any refined grains. For sweeteners, use sugar substitutes, and there are many to choose from now.\n\n\nBut stay away from sweeteners that include maltodextrin as an ingredient listed, as maltodextrin has a high glycemic index and will cause a spike in glucose, even if the main sweetener such as stevia doesn't.\n\n\nThere are recipes for desserts that are sugar-free and relatively low in carbohydrates. These are fine to eat as long as the portion size is small.\n\n\nThe overall carbohydrate content of your diet each day is important, and hydration is also very important, so stay hydrated all the time. Water helps your kidneys filter out excess glucose and that's an easy way to eliminate excessive glucose from your body. Exercise also helps a lot, and taking a walk after a meal helps prevent or eliminate excessive glucose from your body.",

        "body": "I have only been diagnosed since December 31, 2024, so my experience is rather limited. I have changed my diet on January 1st and on to be as close to no-carb as is reasonable. Vegetables have some carbs in them. I do not eat bread, rice, potatoes, or other carbohydrate forward foods. \n\nOne thing I have done is, alongside taking Mounjaro, I have drastically changed my eating habits. Now, I do a lot of meal prep on Sunday, and then it's so much easier to make healthy choices throughout the week.\n\nSunday Prep Pro Tips:\n\n* I peel and chop 2-3 lbs of carrots into sticks and put them in a container in the fridge. \n* I chop a head of broccoli and another of cauliflower, so I can just grab a couple crowns when I'm preparing a meal.\n* I dice an onion, so I can have onion in something I want to cook or eat. A tablespoon of sauteed onions in scrambled eggs, for example, are incredible. \n* I bake 4 split chicken breasts, skin on, then cube it up into 1\" cubes, and put it in a container in the fridge.\n* I drink on average about 2 protein drinks a day. \n* I boil a dozen eggs and peel them, and put them in a container in the fridge.\n* I have low carb prepared options, like sauerkraut, olives, cherry tomatoes, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses, quality beef sticks and jerky strips. \n\nThe next thing you will need to do is keep a food log. That which gets measured gets managed. If you don't keep a food log, you are just kind of winging it. You need the accountability and rigor regular food logging provides. \n\nI created a google spreadsheet that I use to document my meals and get all the macros (carbs, protein, fat, calories) in one place, then, when I prepare and eat a meal, it's super convenient to log it correctly.\n\nWith this strategy, I have been able to lose 97 lbs since the beginning of the year, and all of my medical tests are coming back in the normal range now. I still need to lose 30-40 lbs to be comfortably within the healthy BMI category. But I'm no longer obese.\n\nA delicious, quick meal I have been loving over the last few weeks is to cut small sweet peppers in half length wise, then stuff the little pepper canoe with chicken salad, or artichoke &amp; spinach dip, or hummus + capers + olives, or palmetto cheese. \n\nWith this, if I plan my meals out for the week and hit every target (and any longer, the miss is in under-eating, not over-eating) then I'll eat about 1,650 calories a day. If I miss my target, it's usually because I skipped lunch or didn't eat all of my lunch.",

The problem is some things that count as fiber on a nutrition label can in fact make your blood glucose rise depending on how your body reacts to them. Two of such are modified starches and resistant starches. In my case modified starches will give me a very large spike while resistant starches don't have that affect if consumed in appropriate amounts. A lot of products that tout zero or low net carbs use these ingredients and they'll be listed 1st or 2nd. \n\nThe way I deal with this is by avoiding modified starches entirely and making sure I deduct the total carbs in things with resistant starches from my daily carb budget. When listed I do deduct non-soluable fiber to calculate a figure for net carbs. The details on nutrition labels can be very helpful when eating mindfully and with purpose.",

I then tried the Mission zero carb tortillas with modified starch. I spiked like I'd just had a glazed donut that I never eat because they would spike me so much. Threw the rest of the bag away.\n\nI've since found I can eat steel cut oats, if I refrigerate and reheat them, without spiking, which makes breakfast easier.

Many Type 2 patients who aren’t on insulin still use them, especially when they’re trying to understand patterns, avoid surprises, or stay more engaged with their numbers.\n\nThe tricky part is coverage. Insurance often approves CGMs only for people using insulin, so many Type 2 patients end up paying out of pocket. That’s probably why your doctor said you “don’t need one,” not because it wouldn’t be helpful, but because it isn’t considered medically required by insurance guidelines.\n\nPlenty of people in your situation do use a patch monitor, and it can make a huge difference in understanding how meals, exercise, stress, and sleep affect glucose. If you’re planning to self-pay, many people go with the Libre system because it tends to be the most affordable option.\n\nIt really comes down to what makes your day-to-day easier. Wanting a simpler, less frustrating way to track your numbers is a valid reason, even if you’re not on insulin. If it helps you stay consistent and reduces stress, that’s a meaningful benefit on its own.",

Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia. \nIn October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 mg/dl then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor said it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.",

She’s asked to get tested every 3 months, but even at the pre-diabetes range, she was told to just use “natural” preventative methods.  She finally got down to 5.2 A1c and I think the doctor is testing her less.\n\nIf I had to guess, I think maybe doctors worry about side-effects of drugs when they’re not always needed and try to balance the risk/reward.  I don’t think what your doctor is asking is particularly unusual/concerning.  If your blood sugar levels do go back up, you can always go back on the Metformin.  If you wear a CGM (continuous glucose monitor), you can basically know in real-time and make a quick adjustment if needed.\n\nBiggest negative of Metformin for me is the bloatedness, gas, and diarrhea.",

To be clear, I'm not \"aiming\" for in-range A1c tests, I just want to have appropriate amounts of complex carbs with my meals. His main argument against medication was a worry about hypoglycemia.

I notice it especially on social media, and what frustrates me the most is the hypocrisy these are often the same people who complain about others assuming their diabetes was caused by eating too much sugar or having an unhealthy diet, yet they turn around and use those same stereotypes against people with type 2.\n\nI’ve especially noticed this trend among people with type 1 diabetes on TikTok — they post their “unpopular opinions” about diabetes, and almost every time, one of them involves putting down people with type 2, acting like they’re somehow superior.\n\nI was diagnosed at 11, and I’ve always been healthy and active. My mom is a dietitian, so I grew up in a home where we ate balanced, nutritious meals every day.\n\nI’m honestly exhausted by the assumption especially from people with type 1 that those of us with type 2 diabetes are lazy or could just “fix” it by eating better and exercising more. It doesn’t work like that. Sometimes, it really just comes down to bad genetics.\n",

I have also been overweight all of my life (my mother wasn't though) and ate lots of sugars and carbs, so it's likely I exacerbated it to come on sooner than it would have. But I doubt I would have escaped it altogether. Since being diagnosed and watching my carb intake, I have lost around 50 pounds and still have about 50 to go. I'm 65, so I'm not sure how much more will come off, but for sure some of it will. For me, it was more of a not \"if\" but \"when\" situation.

I’m getting off topic, the problem with this community, and the diabetes one as a whole? Is that they will hear something, parrot it to the other diabetic people. Instead of standing up against the people who aren’t educated. There’s fat people who have type 1 and there’s skinny people who have type 2. It doesn’t help when the stigma is what doctors carry as well. “Oh you’re over the age, and fat, type 2!” Then they’ll keep parroting to lose weight even when you’re trying to do what you can. ",

Hearing that number hit hard and I felt like I’d really let my health spiral out of control.\n\nSoda had always been my biggest vice, and that was the first thing to go. As of today, I’ve gone 166 days without a single soda! \n\nI started metformin in June and added Mounjaro in August. Since my diagnosis, I’ve lost 30 pounds, and my A1C is now 5.6!\n\nI can’t even describe how proud and grateful I feel. It’s not just about the numbers, it’s about feeling in control again, making choices that support my health, and proving to myself that change is possible.\n\nThis community has been such a huge source of strength and motivation for me. Reading everyone’s stories, the challenges, the victories, the ups and downs, has made me feel less alone and more inspired every day. Thank you all for sharing your journeys and helping others believe they can turn things around too. ",

A big part of my social life was going out to bars, sporting events, ect with my friends and drinking. My doctor asked me to not drink for a month and I complied. They now have asked me to not drink for an additional two months. Since my diagnosed I have lost 20 pounds, quit smoking, and my labs and blood sugar have been looking better.

    "selftext": "Cross posting. \n\nHi, My 68 yrs old mum is new newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for about a month now and she hasn't been feeling well ever since she's started taking meds. She was still up and about cooking and cleaning pre-diagnosis, but since on meds, she's been uncomfortable and just stays in bed all day and stares into space or sleeps. \n\nAverage Blood Pressure: 130-148 mmHg\nAverage Blood sugar: 6.6-7.5 mmol/L\n\nShe's lost about 4kg since then. \n\nMeds she's taking: \n- Metformin 500mg once daily \n- Amlodipine 5mg once daily \n- Bisoprolol 2.5mg once daily \n- 14 Amlodipine 10mg once daily (Not sure why twice)\n- 14 Aspirin 75mg once daily \n- 14 Simvastatin 20mg\n\n Her issues below:\n- Super Fatigued\n- Feels weak, even walking around is a challenge \n- Overall feeling exhausted all the time \n- Out of breath generally and when talking \n- Chest discomfort \n- Under arm pain in left side intermittently \n- Upper body feeling hot all the time, but also cold?\n- Lower legs from mid-shin down is cold\n- Always thirsty\n- Dizzy/ headaches \n- Fewer bowel movements 2-3 times a week only\n\nHer diet since diagnosed:\nBreakfast:\n- Small bowl of oats with egg mixed in\n\nLunch &amp; Dinner \n- Brown basmati rice 50-100g dry weight \n- Streamed Fish, chicken or minced pork/ Egg\n- Blanche Lettuce or broccoli\n\nA slice of whole-wheat bread or cracker before meds in late afternoon \n\nLots of water, and only water.\n\nShe's very stubborn and picky with food only eats food that she's used to. \n\nBeing based in the UK, seeing a doctor is near impossible, instead we see nurses unless it's life threatening. Waiting lists are up to 3 weeks to see a doctor. \n\nMy question is, what is making her feel like this? Is it the meds, diet or something else, like menopause or a mental factor - depression?\n\nI'm so worried about her and hate seeing her waste away like this. She's a very strong person before and now can hardly move.\n\nI don't know what else to do.\n\nThanks in advance!\n  ",

        "body": "If she can, it might help to ask her primary care clinician for a referral to a registered dietitian. A dietitian can tailor a plan that fits her goals and medications.\n\nFoods like oats, rice, and bread are higher in carbohydrates, so they can raise blood sugar. Even if the new medicine is helping overall, some meals can still cause bigger after meal rises, and can cause insulin to spike, which can often be a cause for many symptoms associated with diabetes. While she cannot check her insulin levels at home, she can check blood glucose before and about two hours after meals to spot patterns. That simple check can be very helpful.\n\nTrying a lower carbohydrate approach for a few weeks could be a gentle experiment. Build meals around nonstarchy vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Keep portions of grains and starchy foods smaller, if any.\n\nStomach upset is common when starting metformin. Taking it with food, increasing the dose gradually, or asking about the extended release version often helps. If symptoms are strong or do not improve, she should reach out to her prescriber. She should certainly not stop the medicine without guidance though. \n\nFor cold hands and feet, improving circulation can help. Short walks, light stretching, massage, warm baths, staying hydrated, and warm socks or gloves are all good options.\n\nIf the medication is helpful, you’ll start seeing improvement, but it takes the body a while to heal. For many, how they feel around the time of their diagnosis may linger for a long time, but if she is making improvements to her health, eventually will start to feel the effects of those improvements. And any movement in the right direction is a victory.",

Just another day of analyzing every decision I make 🙃 yeehaw. \n\nI am 23F, 5’8, and 106lbs.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed, I immediately became militant with exercise and cutting things out of my diet. As a result, I am now underweight and suffering the consequences. I’m weak, my menstrual cycles stopped, and it’s been especially counterproductive because I don’t even feel like I can lift weights anymore — lol!\n\nI’m upping my caloric intake now, but my body needs some serious healing time. My question is:\n\nMy meals typically put me between 95-125 on my glucometer. Is it really necessary for me to be walking after every one? I would ideally like to make one gym trip a day (have to use the treadmill cuz I’m freezing my buns off).

    "selftext": "\nBig Pharma's portrayal of Type 2 Diabetes as a disease of high blood sugar represents a fundamental deception. The true pathology begins at the cellular level, where industrial seed oils systematically corrupt the body's fundamental architecture.\n\nFor thousands of years, people cooked with natural fats such as tallow, ghee, butter, coconut oil, and olive oil. No human population in history consumed industrial seed oils until roughly 50 to 100 years ago, depending on the country.\n\nNo amount of bleach is safe to drink. Similarly, Industrial seed oils like canola, soybean, corn, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, grapeseed, and rice bran oil are not real food. These oils are all highly processed industrial products extracted from seeds that were never traditionally used for oil, often using heat, pressure, and chemical solvents like hexane. They are chemical solvents and industrial products that have been deodorized and bleached to appear palatable. Your body has no biological pathway to safely process these unstable, polyunsaturated molecules. When you consume them, they integrate directly into your cell membranes, replacing stable saturated fats. This makes your cells fragile and prone to oxidation, creating a constant state of cellular inflammation. This inflammation is the root cause of virtually all modern disease, from diabetes to heart disease to autoimmune disorders.\n\nThere is no safe threshold for a substance that corrupts your cellular infrastructure. You would not accept a daily drop of bleach in your water because a small amount is less toxic than a large amount. The poison is in the mechanism, not just the dose. Seed oils act as a slow, cumulative poison that dismantles your health at the cellular level. Every single gram of these oils contributes to the inflammatory burden that overwhelms your liver, damages your mitochondria, and confuses your immune system.\n\nThe entire notion that these oils can be consumed in moderation is a marketing lie created by the food and pharmaceutical industries. The food industry needs this lie to sell cheap, shelf stable processed garbage. The pharmaceutical industry needs this lie to create the chronically ill patients who will buy statins, metformin, and blood pressure medications for life. Your body does not recognize moderation when the substance itself is a corrupting poison. The only safe amount of seed oil to consume is zero. \n\nIndustrial seed oils are hidden in most foods because they’re cheap and extend shelf life. They’re used in nearly all packaged or processed items, including chips, crackers, cookies, salad dressings, sauces, and even plant based foods. What many people don’t realize is that most commercial breads, buns, bagels, tortillas, pitas, and pizza dough also contain seed oils to keep them soft and shelf stable. Every restaurants rely on these oils for deep frying and griddle cooking, meaning fries, wings, and sandwiches are soaked in them. In short, unless food is cooked at home with natural fats like butter, ghee, tallow, or olive oil, seed oils are almost impossible to avoid.\n\nThe mechanism of destruction unfolds in three distinct phases. First, these unstable polyunsaturated fats incorporate themselves into the phospholipid bilayer of every cell membrane. Unlike stable saturated fats that provide structural integrity, seed oils create fragile, oxidized cell walls that cannot properly communicate with insulin. The hormone's signal to open glucose channels becomes distorted, creating cellular insulin resistance. This is not a hormonal deficiency but a structural failure at the most basic level of cellular organization.\n\nSimultaneously, these corrupted fats travel to the mitochondria, the cellular power plants. Here they generate overwhelming oxidative stress, damaging the delicate energy production machinery. The mitochondria, in an act of self preservation, downregulate their activity and refuse additional glucose fuel. The rising blood sugar represents intelligent cellular rejection of poisoned energy, not a system malfunction.\n\nThe liver becomes the third casualty in this process. Overwhelmed by processing these inflammatory oils and their toxic byproducts, the hepatic system becomes fatty and inflamed. A compromised liver cannot properly regulate blood sugar, further cementing the metabolic disorder. The entire system descends into a state of inflammatory chaos directly traceable to seed oil consumption.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have constructed an elaborate facade around this truth. By blaming blood sugar rather than the cellular inflammation causing type 2 diabetes , they created a trillion dollar market for medications that manage symptoms while ignoring the cause. Drugs that force glucose into resistant cells merely accelerate cellular damage while generating side effects that require additional prescriptions.\n\nThe progression of diabetes follows a predictable pattern of systemic collapse. As cells remain starved of clean energy, tissues begin deteriorating. Nerves suffer damage from glycated proteins, kidneys strain to filter inflammatory waste, and blood vessels develop plaque from the body's desperate attempts to patch oxidized arterial walls with cholesterol. Each complication creates new specialty referrals and drug regimens.\n\nThe silence connecting industrial seed oils to diabetes is not a medical oversight but a calculated corporate strategy. To acknowledge that these processed oils are the primary driver of metabolic collapse would dismantle the entire profit model. The pharmaceutical and processed food industries share a symbiotic relationship where one creates the sickness and the other sells the management of it. \n\nDiabetes represents the perfect perpetual revenue engine for the medical industrial complex. A diagnosis transforms a person into a lifelong customer progressing through an escalating cascade of drug dependencies. It begins with metformin then escalates to thousand dollar monthly injectables like Ozempic before anchoring patients with insulin dependence. The predictable complications then activate secondary revenue streams: statins from cardiologists, dialysis for kidney failure, amputations for neuropathy, and laser surgeries for blindness. Each specialty profits from another piece of the body broken by the unaddressed root cause.\n\nThis system thrives on managed decline rather than genuine healing. Glucose monitors and test strips create recurring revenue while hospitalizations for diabetic complications generate astronomical bills. The entire apparatus from the agricultural giants producing seed oils to the pharmacists dispensing insulin depends on maintaining this cycle of sickness. The body's ability to heal when provided with stable fats and clean nutrients poses an existential threat to this business model. True health remains elusive not because it is complex or expensive but because it is financially catastrophic for the world's most powerful industries.\n\nThe body possesses an extraordinary capacity for healing when provided with the correct conditions. Removing seed oils ends the inflammatory assault. Providing ancestral nutrients enables cellular repair. The diabetic state represents not a permanent sentence but a reversible condition once the true root cause is addressed and eliminated. ",

    "selftext": "Well, it's been a month since my diagnosis, and while my blood sugar levels are fine, I know it's not because of my own effort, and I really need to vent, but I'd better give some context.\n\nIf you're wondering if I still eat sweets, it's only sometimes, probably due to the insulin toujeo or medications like metformin and diamicron(Gliclazide). My blood sugar is usually low when I wake up, between 79 and 90. When it's at 60 (which rarely happens), I usually eat something sweet to raise my sugar a little and prevent it from dropping, like a few small Twix bars, a waffle with sugar, or some juice.\n\nIn fact, I want to share a anecdote that happened to me last Wednesday. When I woke up and had my blood sugar checked, it was 73, and I was a little relieved that it wasn't at 60. For breakfast, because I had to get to school quickly (it's my last year of school, if you're wondering), I only ate about three sugar-free cookies and drank unsweetened milk. Before leaving, I took my three medication pills, but I decided to bring something sweet in case my blood sugar dropped. At school, I felt confused and tired, and I got scared. I thought my blood sugar was low, so I decided to eat my sugar cookies to see if I would feel better. And well, in the end, I did, but I was still worried. In the cafeteria, I ate a breaded chicken and two balls of mashed potatoes. I didn't have a choice; it was all there was, so I decided to eat just one plate. When I got home, I decided to rest a bit. Unfortunately, I didn't have time for my daily walk because I had to take care of my younger siblings. Luckily, I had gym class today, and I actually ran a lot. Then I injected my insulin at the time I usually do (at 6:00 PM; I live in Belgium, if you're wondering). Then I played video games to try to forget about food, and before going to sleep, I took my second blood test, and it was 77. That surprised me; it's usually between 90 and 110. Once in 114, and especially because I ate several sugary foods at different times (the cookies I mentioned before, and a small croissant when I got home), sometimes I'm grateful I still have my insulin injection\n\nYes… I know everyone on this subreddit is right, I know I have to stick to my diet, because I still eat pizza (a whole one and surprisingly it didn't raise my blood sugar much, I even expected my insulin wasn't enough), and snacks (only when my blood sugar is under control… at least I'm exercising (I hope my one-hour walk is enough), and I know that maybe I don't have to use my daily insulin injection and use medications like metformin and diamicron (I know it's only been a month since my diagnosis and maybe I'll have this for months or years) forever.\n\nBut the thing is… this way I feel like a normal person and not like a sick person, I still have the guilt and the shame of having diabetes. At 20 years old, I still cry every day since my diagnosis, and I've realized how much my diabetes has affected me emotionally. I'm even crying as I write this. I know it's possible I developed it earlier because of my genetics (my dad's family was full of diabetics,he takes care of himself, and in fact, he and my mom try to support me). I try to be positive, no matter if I try to exercise, fast, or eat healthy, because I know it's because of my insulin and medication that my blood sugar is controlled. I haven't noticed many changes, and that worries me a lot because I think I'll never be able to go into remission, even if I try really hard, because I'm a total failure and my life is ruined forever…\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous, but I want to ask my doctor at my next appointment if I can continue using insulin injections and medication for longer, and if I can at least do it for a few years until I'm ready, because I want to enjoy my 20s a little more… I also want to ask him for a psychologist.\n\nPlease don't judge me… I'm already too sad and guilty,I'm too… affected by that",

Ingesting fat before the test can raise the triglyceride result a bit, which is why the blood test should be done in the fasted state.\n\nIf you mean can sugar raise triglycerides in general - not any more than any other carb.  Excess carbs in the blood after a meal, in a person with insulin resistant muscle tissue, are largely converted to fat in the liver.  The liver then pumps that fat into the blood as triglycerides, evenly over the day.  The same goes for protein and to some extent fat in meals though so the effects of diet on triglycerides aren't something to worry much about.  If you're overweight and have elevated triglycerides the single most effective thing you can do about it is to lose weight.",

A regular cholesterol medication, like Lipitor (statin) will moderately help triglycerides, if they aren't super high, but aren't a good long term solution if your other cholesterols are in line.  Controlling the diabetes along with fenofibrate has made a huge impact on my tri numbers.  I had acute pancreatitis once as well for super high triglyerides (1100+) and that's when I started on the fenofibrate.  Now they are down to under 100 consistently.

I was diagnosed and started metformin 3 days ago but about 2 days ago I started having some pretty nasty back pain. It seems to calm with heat and ibuprofen so I’m hoping that it’s just back pain but I’ve convinced myself I’m in kidney failure or I have diabetic nephropathy, my pain does feel deeper than average back pain and I don’t have a very physically demanding job. I had a elevated white blood cell count and there was elevated protein in my urine. My eGFR was 135 and there was low and the Creatinine in my blood was .65 so I don’t know if I should be worried about kidney issues or not. (I’m a very big hypochondriac and none of this started until I was diagnosed I was only diagnosed because I went in for a headache and they wanted to do a blood test to rule anything else out) ",

Diabetes essentially limits what your pancreas can do to help balance out your blood sugars with insulin. Which means you need to balance your blood sugars manually by controlling what you eat and what you do. Low blood sugar is dangerous. High blood sugar is dangerous. That's why having a way to monitor your current blood sugar level is important, because you know what you need to correct for. Too high, exercise and hydrate, avoid all carbs but still take on calories. Too low, eat something balanced. Far too low, eat some sweets/candy. \n\nMost people find that an Atkins diet works well as a baseline, as you're getting the calories you need to function, whilst keeping the carbs low. Carbs basically equals sugars. Understanding nutrition helps a lot with managing diabetes. There's lots of information out there. I found the book by Professor Roy Taylor very useful for me in understanding how I can control and reverse the effects of diabetes.\n\nMy recommendation for you is (not a doctor)\n1) get a blood glucose monitor - finger prick test\n2) widen your diet to follow Atkins \n3) learn about nutrition and diabetes",

I'm off all my meds, except I take Berberine 2 times a day. I work nights, so my schedule is all ways messed up. \n My last 4 A1C tests have been under 5. No meds, and I exercise like my life depends upon it. \n  Try what I recommend,  please.  It will help. \nRemember to play the long game.  You're 38 and still young.  \nI'm 49 and went from 375lbs to 205lbs. It's chess, not checkers.\nI haven't had any carbs in a couple years. I don't miss them at all.",

Easy fix.\n\nBlood sugar rises: there are dozens of factors over and above what we eat which can push up blood sugar. The big one is stress. The more stressed you are the more glucose will be pumped out in to your blood. The same goes for a lack of sleep and not getting enough water. Rest, relax and hydrate.\n\nEating carbs again: yes and no. I'm three years in and I stopped missing carbs two and a half years ago. I probably could eat some now, but it never crosses my mind to. The goal is consistency in low blood sugar readings; once the sugar is low and level, the body can begin to handle a few bits here and there. Try some things out, and see how your body reacts.",

A1C of 7.8% works out to an average of 177, so if you’re seeing low 100s before you go to sleep you’re probably well on your way to lowering your A1C. That said, you’re not going to have perfect numbers after only a month. Don’t get discouraged.\n\nIt also sounds like you have dawn phenomenon issues, with your BG rising so much in the morning. I would suggest reading about that if you haven’t. \n\nAre you on the extended release metformin? That can help with the GI side effects.\n\nSomething else that helps is physical activity. Taking a short walk after a meal and getting into a regular strength training routine can help your BG numbers immensely. You’ll often see a little spike right after vigorous exercise but overall increased activity and muscle mass will help control your BG by making you better at using insulin.",

The kind of hunger that makes it so you can’t focus and might also make you want to kill someone. HA.\n\nHere’s the deal. If I’m going to be fit, I have to eat.

Keeping all of those within the suggested limits and staying nourished is impossible. So today, I said fuck it. I don’t want to spike but my sodium is going to go over 2,300. I’m just too hungry. \n\nHas anyone else had this issue? How strict are you with your sodium?\n\n… I also wasn’t great about my fat intake today.

I no longer care much about fats apart from avoiding partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Nor do I care much about salt/sodium; as I understand it that is only a problem for those who are already hypertensive. I consume both in sensible quantities. In fact, when I initially avoided salt after my diagnosis I suffered severely from increased leg cramps.\n\nI care a lot about excessive carbs.\n\nMy longer opinion on diet is here: [What is a Balanced Diet For a Type 2 Diabetic?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/what-is-balanced-diet-for-type-2.html)",

Regardless, I eat salt with abandon and drink electrolyte water almost exclusively, and my blood pressure is fine.\n\nI guess my point is that the “basic rules” about healthy diets have a lot of variation and nuance. I’d keep investigating til you find something that works for you, because the way you’ve been losing weight isn’t healthy or sustainable. You can have other negative health outcomes from being underweight. ",

You can also buy no salt added canned goods for your pantry so that you can use them on days you are too busy to cook from scratch  \n\nFor fats, since you are so underweight you can afford to have plenty of calories, just concentrate on good fats rather than saturatedd fats.  So for meats, stick with skinless boneless chicken breast and tenderloins, lean pork loin and pork tenderloins and extra lean ground beef. \n\nFor healthy fats, you can get that from avocado and unsalted nuts.  There are plenty of unsalted nuts or mixed nuts (peanuts and cashews are the ones that are most widely available).  You can also make your own if there are particular nuts that you preferred. Simply get the raw version (hence they will be unsalted), roast them in a single layer at 350F for 8-10 min and let it cool completely.  \n\nYou can also use no salt alternatives like Dash to season your food.  I put my daily sodium limit at 1500mg and I am usually well under.  Once awhile I will be over by a little bit but never above 2000mg. \n\nFinally, if you like deli meat, Boar's Head makes an excellent no sodium roast turkey.  They alos have one for roast beef but I can't find anywhere in my neighborhood that carries them.  For naturally high sodium prepared food like smoked ham, start with ones with a reasonable amount of salt.  So like 500mg per serving, then soaked the ham overnight then you can cook it for breakfast. If you are doing the whole ham, obviously need longer soaking time and change of water.  I buy Dietz and Watson chef carved boneless ham which is lean (so low in saturated fat) and have a good amount of protein and low in sugar.",

Eat at a slight surplus of those items to put it back on until you are not a skeleton. Use a TDEE calc online to see how much you need to consume. Then eat towards making those numbers until you reach a place where you are healthy, and not hungry all the time. \n\nI am dealing with very similar issues trying not to get too much of anything right now. While I manage my weight back down from around 215 today, to 160-165 where it needs to be between now, and end of March when I see my doctor again. And do it while not coming in with super high lipids/cholesterol, or other things off the charts with the lab she will order and run. \n\nOne of my key foods for achieving this is tins of sardines, mackerel, salmon, and even chicken and tuna to a lesser degree. Whether I get these in brine (way too salty), or oil (way too oily), I need to rinse all canned items off well with water, even the veggies. This removes a really good amount of both the fat and sodium, leaving me with clean protein/veggies in the form of fish that are naturally oily. A lot of the oil I get comes this way, it is natural and exists within these fish. I drai\n\nLast night, I thought i did well. I cooked a pound of hamburger meat, and because it was 80/20 ground chuck, I rinsed it really well under hot water, then used paper towels to remove all of the oil. But I actually pulled out too much fat, and wasn't going to make that number. I had plenty of calories left, and would still be in a deficit (I need to lose weight), so I ate 1T of olive oil to get the necessary fats into me for the day. Those keep you more full, make you a bit stronger, and keep you satisfied, and provide critical lubrication of the digestive track. My system is very sensitive right now from eating like this for the last 6 weeks, and my scale is moving the right way, and my hunger is almost always well controlled allowing me to not snack, and not grab fast food, or other easy to ingest items, and instead focus on clean protein, adequate fat, minimal carbs. \n\nThis stuff takes practice, you may start, fail, have to get back on, and keep trying till you get your groove. I learned to eat and stay on diet like this much earlier in my life. Back when I was around your age and I was lifting weights a lot, even doing so competitively at one time. Don't give up on things, and it will eventually click into place for you I feel.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nThree months ago my HbA1c was 10.2, and I honestly thought I was done for. Always tired, always hungry, always blaming my glucometer 😅.\n\nThen I decided to stop overthinking and just do the basics right:\n\nMonitored my sugar daily — pre and post meals. Painful but eye-opening. I used CGM during twice - 2weeks at the start of diet plan and 2 weeks just before testing \nOther days, I was checking using finger pricks, daily morning. \n\nCut carbs (bye white rice, we had a good run).\n\nAte real food: eggs, grilled chicken, grilled salmon, veggies, dal, and millets.\n\nIntermittent fasting: 8 PM to 12 PM — tough at first, then oddly freeing.\n\nWalked 60–90 mins daily. Some days longer. \n\nI stopped chasing “perfect numbers” and started chasing consistency. And it worked:\n\n➡️ HbA1c: 10.2 → 5.6\n➡️ Weight: 92 kg → 78 kg\n➡️ Energy: finally not powered by caffeine alone ☕\n\nStill enjoy the occasional biryani (because life), but now I understand what my body can handle.\n\nIf you’re starting out — don’t wait for motivation. Just start small, stay consistent, and your numbers will follow. 💪",

I know this is pretty low in comparison to seeing some of everyone else’s A1c levels when they were diagnosed so I asked my doctor if I could try out with diet and exercise for three months and see if I could lower it naturally without medication and she okayed that I’m currently three weeks in did a complete cold turkey cut carbs cut sugar I even cut out all caffeine. I only drink water and I am now doing intermittent fasting and in three weeks I’ve lost 24 pounds. However I know that’s gonna slow down and I am very obese at 370 pounds so I know it’s gonna slow down and so forth but I’m really happy with what I’ve accomplished so far and really praying that when I get my next A1c test in January that it will have taken me out of the diabetic range and hopefully into pre-diabetic range or even into non-diabetic, but I just want to see an improvement on it",

I believe they do give the newly diagnosed some perspective and hope because I know when I first found out I thought my life was over, but finding posts like these gave me a foundation of real time cases to reframe my mind.\n\nThere are hundreds of people with success stories but they're not posted often. On the other hand are some tuff questions and experiences that require some shared information so those tend to be the posts that tips the scale. \n\nI did 12.4 to 6.0 in 3 months without any use of meds. \nNext A1C is coming up in December. \n\nTo start out I did have constant urination which went away 2-3 days after diagnosis and blurry vision lasted 1-2 weeks. \n\nNothing has shown up since. Feet tests and eye scans are all great. Test panels are all great now.\n\nBreakfast is usually a protein shake of some kind or something lite but with lots of protein.\n\nLunch and dinner however is a whole surprising story for  \"my journey\" I typically have 100-125+ grams of carbs in each of those meals. A month or so into diagnosis when I started testing meals the numbers have always been surprising.\n\nI still record everything to share with my doctor. \n\nYesterday for lunch I had a chicken sandwich, veggies, sauces etc and 3 medium sized chocolate chip cookies.\n\nBaseline before was: 4.7 mmol\n30 min: 7.2 mmol\n1 hr: 7.0 mmol\n1.5 hr: 6.0 mmol\n2 hr: 6.0 mmol\n2.5 hr 5.4 mmol \n\nDinner was eaten around 8pm from a restaurant called poulet rouge. A pretty mixed meal including rice and veggies, chicken, corn, beans, cheese,..etc. I didn't collect my readings for this as I had to get my son to bed. \n\nI woke up this morning 4.8 mmol. (7:30 AM)\n\nHopefully this information is helpful for someone.\nTest everything and collect data for how your body is processing and handling. It's truly different for everyone.",

It acts like a poison in a way- small doses don’t do anything but over that it starts damaging the whole body. Getting rid of the stored glucose/glycogen and giving your body time away from having to process loads of dietary carbs/sugar allows it to heal a bit and regain some capacity to process it better (it will remain ultra sensitive to over use over too long - a level that is different for everyone). A cgm will help you to learn what your body can handle and what it can’t as well as where you are as you improve.\n\nPS- the daily intermittent fast (8pm to 12pm) that OP mentioned really helps to break that sick metabolism and push down your baseline by forcing out the stored garbage in your body. Takes about 2 weeks but then becomes easy and absolutely freeing as your body gets healthy again!",

Maybe even get a step counter so you can set a goal of taking so many steps in a day, one of those smart watches has given me a lot of motivation to keep at it and to sustain some type of activity level.\n\nAfter you have introduced some activity for your body start looking at the foods you eat.  What is your understanding of a diabetic meal?  What do you eat now?  What do you think is healthy for you?  Make a list of things you feel is healthy for you and we can help explain to you what is healthy for diabetics.  \n\nI think we've all been through this, we don't get much help when we are diagnosed except to take these meds and maybe get some pamphlets so it takes us quite some time with trial and error to see what is what.

But then I couldn't eat for a day before a medical procedure, and I was fine. I was shocked, but I was fine.\n\nMy approach has been to eliminate what I call \"obvious carbs\". For breakfast, I have three strips of turkey bacon with 1/3 cup of generic liquid eggs, like Egg Beaters, scrambled. I lay the eggs on top of the turkey bacon, cover the eggs with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and cover it with a saucepan lid to melt the cheese. Slap it with lots of Tabasco to wake up.\n\nFor my coffee, I was addicted to International Delight. I replaced it with nutpods French Vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of Allulose powder.\n\nAnd that's it. That's my entire breakfast. No toast. No bagels. Definitely no danish. Around 10:30, I'll have a few tablespoons of homemade Greek yogurt with several halved strawberries, a few tablespoons of Allulose powder (again), and crushed walnuts.\n\nFor lunch, I have a garden salad with grilled chicken bites added.\n\nFor dinner, I sprinkle some Paul Prudhomme's Meat Magic on boneless skinless chicken breast and cook it in the Instant Pot. Then I microwave a bag of Steam-in-Bag vegetables, like broccoli and cauliflower. Hit the veggies with butter, hand-cracked black pepper, and a lot of garlic powder. And that's it for dinner. No potatoes. No butter bread. No garlic bread. That's it. For variation, I'll heat up some frozen meatballs on the stove with Rao's Marinara and sprinkle parmigana chesse on top. Not in a roll, no garlic bread. Just five meatballs in a bowl. I hit them with Italian seasoning and lots of garlic powder.\n\nI wrote a post several months ago that details how I got hundreds of cookbooks for free from Amazon. I also posted a typical menu that covers me for the month.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jj61j6/cookbook_hack/\n\nI'm down 65 lbs so far and off all meds.

Exercising can be dancing around your home with fun music playing, to a walk around your block or a hike with friends or a doggo if you have one.\n\nDiet is huge, of course, and there can be options for bread/tortillas and the like.  I get bagel thins 18 carbs for one, for sandwiches or with cream cheese. Protein, fat and carbs in meals.

You’re young and likely haven’t suffered any of the suffering that results from having let things go for many years…some of which mercilessly are irreversible - crap!\n\nThe good news is that while the changes needed to correct t2 are significant, they need not be unpleasant. The sooner steps are taken and maintained, the better your body gets over time and even allows for more leniency (treats-wise). \n\nEveryone is different and has unique drivers regarding what motivates. Ask yourself: What are yours?  Mine are: LOVE of flavor and variety, emotional/ self-soothing eating, Desire for in-restricted quantity until satiety is achieved… that is to say I cannot eat a fixed tiny amount and expect to feel satisfied, Hunger.\n\nI found lots of work-arounds and replacements for things I knew I’d miss. I chose super low carb to heal and now eat regular low carb to maintain to gains. I do not and did not use meds. I’m not an active person and am older so this approach took me longer than it would have if I were 21. The results: a1c down to 5.4 from 10.2, lost 65 lb without feeling deprived or hungry, lipid panel is normal for the first time in DECADES, liver is back to healthy, clear head (after lots of brain fog), stable energy, cravings GONE….\n\nBiggest revelation in all this was experiencing the metabolic switch showed me that my eating habits were never about will-power.!!!!They were completely driven by the sugar/glucose dependence of my body chemistry. Once I switched from primarily using sugar for fuel to using primarily fat for fuel- it was so liberating! The cravings and feeling of ravenous hunger just ended.\n\nThe keys for me were:\n\n1. Break the sugar cycle\n2. Get a cgm to see what foods spike me\n3. Learn to make low carb versions of the things I love/miss so that I don’t feel the need to stray. \n4. Eat the heck out of the low carb/no carb real foods that I already like (for me it’s meat(bacon! Steak), cheese, eggs, salmon, steamed veg with blue cheese or ranch dressing), sugar free jello, strawberries….)\n5. Allow/plan for 1 cheat meal per month (meal - not day)\n\nMessage me if you want to chat :)",

        "body": "The peak of the spike happens anywhere from 40 or so minutes to around two hours after you begin eating, depending on what you eat.  Around an hour would be about average.  The more rapidly digested the carbs the quicker the glucose hits the bloodstream.  Everything in the meal that's not carbs slows digestion to varying degrees, basically.  If you eat a feast of carbs like a whole pizza you might still have high levels three or four hours later.\n\nTesting before eating and two hours later is a reasonable way to compare meals with one another without doing a whole lot of finger sticking.  It's not perfect, you're typically seeing the falling level after the spike and you might miss a high fast spike from eating something very sweet, but for most meals the two hour mark is a good indicator of whether the meal is reasonably okay.  Being consistent with the timing lets you compare meals and (probably) find the most troublesome foods.\n\nIt's worth bearing in mind though that the blood glucose response after breakfast, lunch and dinner is different due to the second meal phenomenon.  You might find for example that you can get away with eating more carbs for lunch than for breakfast, even if the foods eaten are identical.  You might not have to rule out some foods or portion sizes completely if they only cause problems if eaten as the first meal of the day.  The same portion might be fine for lunch.\n\nBest of luck!",

    "selftext": "I plan to switch PCP. I requested a monitor and I am paying $75 out of my HSA. My PCP was negative about me getting one because I’m not on insulin. The nurse told me I lost 4lbs and my blood pressure was down and my PCP didn’t even mention it. I hope this monitor helps me prove to this PCP to quit telling me to exercise more and quit questioning my diet. I shouldn’t have an adversarial goal included in my health journey but I do. This is my after lunch and afternoon snack numbers. Also she upped my blood pressure by 4 times and prescribed me metformin ER. I know there will be people telling me that I’m misreading the situation and I’m cool with all comments. Thank you 😊 ",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been having my struggles trying to find the perfect pair of slip on shoes to combat my neuropathy.  Thank god for Amazon’s liberal return policy but damn I’d really like to find a pair of shoes that is comfortable and doesn’t kill my feet.\n\nIt probably doesn’t help that I also have flat feet so throw in orthotics to make me really feel like I’m hunting a unicorn while also trying to stay around the $50 mark.\n\nI’ve found that the Skechers slip ons get me the closest while also staying in my price range.  The only problem is the normal sizing is a bit too tight on the front of my foot.  And if I go with the wide or x-wide version it’s too loose around my ankle and my foot just slops around in the shoe.\n\nAnyone else in a similar boat as I am that was able to find a shoe that feels like wrapping your feet in soft velvety goodness?",

I also wonder if you've tried going up a half size. \n\nI have small feet so this does not help most people but as a 6.5 in women's, I can wear girls 4 and 4.5. I currently have 4 pairs of girls and 2 women's and straight out of the box the girls have more support (also totally flat feet) and more cushioning, and bonus they go on sale more often, so I pay closer to $30/pair.\n\nI have been wearing them so long I can say some small differences in the patterns can really change the toe box fit. I don't like the ones with fake laces vs elastic that looks more like a design, it's tighter when it looks like laces...  But that could be what you need to keep the fit tighter around your ankle.\n\nI just think life is better with rainbows, fun colors and even glitter on my feet that's so easily washed because I also do not do socks.",

But the doctors keep saying just make sure I wear shoes always when walking. For me I need the support of the arch built-in. I shop the Fila outlet mall website. But I also know what I want and what size. If I get anything else I end up with lower back pain that will move on all the way up to my shoulders. Last years black Friday sale was off the hook. Buy one pair got two free. So I brought 2 pairs and got 4 free. It's a win for me because that's over a years worth of shoes for me. I still have two pairs waiting to be worn.

I had my bloods done following a wound on my toe that wasn't healing well, I had no other symptoms at all and my BMI is 23.\n\nMy hbA1c results in July were 107 which was obviously a huge shock and really concerning. I have health anxiety as well so to go from thinking I was well to thinking I was really not well was a massive adjustment, as well as the barrage of medical appointments that followed.\n\nI started treatment with Metformin straight away, was offered Glicazide as well but decided to try sort out my diet first and ended up not taking it at all. \n\nI didn't do anything particularly scientific with my diet but worked hard to reduce my carb in take in general and cut out obviously sugary foods/drinks. I haven't been able to focus too much of losing weight as my weight wasn't considered high anyway, but I have of course noticed changes.\n\nI self funded CGMs for 2 months which really helped my understanding my trends and which combinations of foods worked best for me (i.e. protein!).\n\n3 months on and my repeat hbA1c today came back as 47. I know I still need to continue working hard and get it lower, but I am so happy to have made this much progress in 3 months.\n\nIt just feels good I guess to have some positive news on this front after a difficult few months, and it helps me feel like the work and changes are worth it.\n\nI am still very much at the beginning of my journey but wanted to share so far.",

What’s really funny is it follows the pacing of the talk! The top of the peak is pretty much to the minute when I took all the things I discussed and explained how they’re related. It’s the “impact” moment. I’m not worried about it because it came right back down, but it is really funny to see that the thing that spikes me the most (stress and adrenaline) are the 1 thing I literally can’t control. \n\nAlso learned the lesson that I need to pay more attention to the crash after.

Your brain is made up of cholesterol and statins lower cholesterol. I’m NOT telling you to stop taking your meds but it really ticks me off that Drs don’t treat and they just throw meds at you. You can get this under control through diet and exercise IF you want to. I feel like meds should be option 2. Whatever works best for you. For me, I stopped eating carbs and sugar. I went HIGH fiber, HIGH protein and high GOOD fats. My cholesterol is normal and my Dr still wants to put me on a statin. Why? I told her no meds. I will do this myself. If you have the willpower to stick with it, i highly recommend intermittent fasting. Eat breakfast and a big lunch. No snacking. Drink water or tea (unsweetened) of course. The fasting will give your body time to recover and you won’t be spiking 3 times a day or more. I now tend to go low so I carry a protein bar with me at all times and some apple juice. In a month I lost 10 pounds and had no more tingling in my feet. I’m going back for my 3 month A1C check and I’m hoping to be under 7. If you can, after you eat, get up and move. Even if it’s a quick 5-10 minute walk. To me the Drs should give us 2 options Diet and exercise and tell us WHAT to eat OR meds. One or the other. I just think our medical industry has gone so far down the toilet. “Do no harm” has been replaced with “profits over people” younger people are being diagnosed with cancer and diabetes then ever before. Why? Because our food is severely damaged and deficient in nutrients and vitamins. It now takes like 5-7 oranges to get the same amount of vitamins and minerals as 1 orange back in 1970.",

Unlikely... Your HbA1c is on the high side.. But there's way worse. Don't get paranoid about the many possible ways you could die as if T2 doesn't kill you, stress definitely will. 😉\n\nYou need to monitor your BG to have an idea of how t2 affects your BG levels throughout the day/night . No two people are the same.  Some have lower levels at night other higher. Once you understand yours you can act on it and learn what works for your specific circumstance to get it right in case levels are out. There are many tricks we all use.\n\nI would react same way if I had to take insulin so I hear your pain. Use the fear you feel right now as an incentive to adjust your life style and make life long changes that will allow you to live a long and healthy life and very likely stop taking insulin and any other medication.\n\nYou will be fine... if you apply yourself that's a certainty 😊",

As someone who works in software development, it's frustrating because I know the data is there - but I'd love having more access to it within the app. I'd even be willing to pay a monthly fee for that, if it had the right features.\n\nI would also really love an app for my Fitbit so I can check my values at a glance without having to pull out another device.

If anything he gained a few lbs instead of losing the 50 he needs to.  \n\nI was sure the next time he went to the dr his A1C would be much higher but then one night I checked his blood sugar 2 hours after he ate and sundae.  2 scoops, hot fudge….his blood sugar was 120.  I was sure it would be like 250.  A year ago and this year his A1C is 6 and fasting around 112.  The only thing he did was take more supplements.  Berberine being one of them.  How has he not gotten any worse?   I’m happy he didn’t but just wondering.  I don’t think Berberine would change things that much.  \n\nI exercised for years and my A1C was 10.9.

    "selftext": "So for context, I had DKA once, when I first found out I was diabetic 5 years ago. I thought I had a bad UTI, and maybe a flu because my head was feeling very foggy, but upon going to urgent care, I was directed to immediately go to the hospital, as I had DKA. \n\nToday, I woke up and had that same ALMOST painful, frequent urgent urination. I checked my blood sugar between trips to the bathroom, and at first it was 300 and I almost rushed to the hospital right then and there. But then I realized I hadn't taken my Metformin ER in a few days, so I took it, and have been drinking lots of water to try and help flush my system. Over the last hour and a half, the urination urgency is mostly gone, and I've been checking my blood sugar every 30 mins, and it is now down to at least 250. Should I be considering this as DKA still, and go to the hospital? Or just keep monitoring and hydrating before making an expensive decision? My financial and insurance situations are both not great at the moment, and a trip to the hospital could very well be a lot more than I can afford right now, so I don't want to go if I'm just over reacting.\n\nAnd just to add, I know my numbers are very bad right now. Please don't drag me down over it,  as I've been in a rough place these past 7 months, and my mental and physical health have taken a massive hit in the process",

Recent lab results: \n\nFasting Glucose: 94 \n\nFasting Insulin: 12.2 \n\nC Peptides: 2.2 \n\nHOMA-IR: 2.8 \n\nA1C: 5.4 \n\nFurther context: approximately one year ago, I had an a1c of 5.6 on my prenatal labs. This was high for me as I am extremely active and health conscious. I am 5 ft 9 and weighed approximately 122 pounds at the time. I was evaluated by an endocrinologist and my FBG was 87. Due to a complete breakdown of circumstances, I didn't receive proper screening during my pregnancy for gestational diabetes. My doctor used A1C instead of the standard OGTT which I now know mean nothing. Fast forward to post partum, I began checking my blood sugars at home and realized they were highly elevated, suggesting I may have had missed gestational diabetes. I pushed for a functional test and additional labs and things were high enough that my doctor put me on metformin for a month. I do not fit the typical picture for T2 or insulin resistance because I am thin, active, and have never had glucose issues before. For the last two months I have meticulously controlled my diet, used metformin for a month, and my numbers have only worsened. I'm extremely dismayed. \n\nI will also add that I developed horrible eye floaters during pregnancy (doctor ruled out any retinopathy). I also have low c3 and c4 complement levels (75 and 10). I have lost a precipitous amount of weight postpartum and now weigh only 115 pounds. I have struggled to keep weight on. I will also add that my covid antibodies are high and have risen from 12,000 to 15,000 in the last 2 months despite no repeat infection. Does anyone have any ideas at all? I feel like I'm fighting for my health and it's terrifying. ",

I couldn’t take the Libre sensors being faulty and always on the low side. I’m talking 20 to 30 points and that is with the delay. The last sensor I had was ok for about three days and then started trending lower. I was sitting here and boom alarms going off and it was reading 63 and dropping. A poke and I’m sitting at 97 so I said that’s it and I ripped off the sensor. I dunno, maybe it’s me, but the past three days have been far more relaxing without it. I got too hung up on every swing down I‘d see on the app that would shoot my anxiety to the roof even though I knew it was most likely a false reading. Initially having a working CGM was a game changer and I’m not saying they’re useless. If I felt that the tech was more stable I’d keep wearing one. I love data, but for me it became an obsession.\n\nSo now I’m figuring out a good schedule of just checking with my regular meter and letting how I feel determine if I need a spot check.\n\nAnyone else who has good control given up on them?",

She was kinda shocked because I've never taken my health seriously until then, and she said \"the reports are really good\"\n\nI feel so happy! My next goal is to get my fasting closer to 90, and my pp under 120. I think losing the remaining weight should help with that, and longer term goal is to get off meds completely.",

First: please take reddit information about type 2 diabetes with a grain of salt.\n\nYou need to fuel your body, and a fasting glucose in the 130s isn't bad. Eat when you are hungry- even the rice if you want it (it's important to eat all foods and learn through your glucose monitor how your body responds to different foods at different times, anyway). You might find you need lots of high protein, high fiber snacks during the school day to keep you going. There are so many amazing options!\n\nIf an endo appointment is hard to come by, ask your doctor if they can refer you to a clinical pharmacist. My diabetes care is managed by my clinical pharmacist. That may be a quicker and more accessible option right now.\n\nDiabetes is scary and can feel really lonely; be gentle with yourself. And thank you for being a teacher!",

If your liver thinks you need energy it’ll dump glucose into your bloodstream (so helpful! lol).\n\nKeeping low or no carb snacks readily available is helpful, especially if your options are sometimes eat a snack or eat nothing. That said, the conventional advice for T2 diabetics is to avoid snacking between meals to allow your BG to get lower again.\n\nI feel compelled to add, since I just mentioned a piece of dietary advice: there are a TON of dietary approaches that have helped different T2s. Low carb, keto, carnivore, vegan, Mediterranean, intermittent fasting, one meal a day, several small meals, 3 meals with no snacks, 3 meals with snacks, etc etc etc etc. It’s tough because a lot of people on Reddit tend to speak as if the way they eat that controls their BG is THE WAY to eat to have success with BG control. The reality is that there’s probably more than one thing that works for most people, and the biggest concern imo is how sustainable your new dietary path is for you. You’ll have to figure out what works for you - medically, ethically, logistically, lifestyle-wise, budget-wise. Testing to see how different foods affect you will be really important as you figure that out.\n\nAnd I second the advice to walk more if you can :) For both your stress level and to help control your BG (which stress can affect).",

I asked my PCP to let me do some research and give me a chance, she gave me 3 mos. I’m a biology major, so the science made sense to me. Completely overhauled my diet, low carb but not keto, around 45g per day and I counted every single carb not just the bad ones. Exercise. Lost 45lbs. By my 6 mos follow-up I was down to 6.2 A1c, within a year I was under 5. No meds, no insulin. I do wear a cgm. Everything was great until May of this year, no major changes in lifestyle, my numbers just started creeping up. In June my Apple fitness app alerted me that id had a drastic shift and my avg glucose was in the 200’s!! Went to PCP, A1c was 6.9. She put me on mounjaro 2.5, very next A1c was 4.9. I’m staying on the mounjaro at the 2.5 dose, I’ve lost ten pounds and no side effects, since I already have the diet down I may not need to go up in dosage. \nRemission is a great idea, but it doesn’t work for everyone and it may not last forever. I’ve had doctors tell me I’m not diabetic with an A1c this low. Ha! One mini soda is all it would take to put me over 300. Find a diet/exercise plan that is sustainable for you. Take meds if you need them. You want to live your best life as long as possible, that’s my goal.",

After that I went to the clinic, gimme the diagnosis and was given Jardiance Duo 12.5/1000. However, that medicine gimme DKA, admitted for 5 days and I have to change my medicine to Janumet XR 50/1000. I stay consistent on the medicine, workout a lot and intermittent fasting of 16/8 or 14/10, depends on the day. Did I diet? Yes but not that strict. The only thing that is constant is no sugary drink, I do have donuts and ice cream once in a blue moon.\n\nNow, I got my new result just now, and my hba1c is 5.9. Not gonna lie, I'm way happy that I achieve it. I will continue on my journey to be a better person. But I have to admit, my weight only decreases from 111 kg to 105 kg in these 4 months of recovery. Btw I'm male at the age of 28.\n\nI was reading thru all the post here as a lurker, to give me idea on how to lower my hba1c and thanks to you guys, and the medicine as well. I'm able to achieve my current hba1c. You guys are the best!\n",

But honest, I did not know how stupid I was being until recently.\n\nLong story short, doc originally thought this was PCOS about a year ago. I immediately went keto and started exercising — felt great! Then, after the diabetes diagnosis, shit hit the fan. I didn’t realize it, but I started starving myself. I was eating low cal, exercising like BANANAS, and now I’m in a pit of trouble. I’m severely underweight, my periods have completely disappeared, and I feel like I’m hanging on a thread both mentally and physically.\n\nHas anyone here recovered from an eating disorder? I’m scared that reintroducing a lot of food will make my diabetes body/metabolism go “CODE RED” and flip out.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, though I want to point out:\n\n1. Im in school and can’t afford therapy\n2. I did message my endo but I don’t trust her full heartedly with this stuff \n\nThank you!",

        "body": "Hiii, something similar happened to me after being diagnosed and I'm currently in recovery as well. What I did was eat at my maintenance calories (sometimes above) and increased my step count-- I also have ocd so slowly increasing my calorie intake whilst being active helped me maintain my weight and eased my anxiety of not being able to control my glucose. Some background info on me is that I got diagnosed with diabetes during the pandemic after getting covid, and have been managing with diet and exercise after tapering off of metformin and insulin years ago. Walking is my main form of exercise and I usually walk for more than an hour, and strength train 2-3 times a week. My latest a1c was at 4.8, and I've been walking for the past 20 months (almost daily) and have lost 50+ pounds and kept control of my diabetes off of this alone. I've recently taken up baking and cooking as a hobby and have made healthier diabetic friendly alternatives to foods and sweet treats that I like from recipes that I've come across online.\n\nWhat has really helped me recover the most is mindset change--because I have other health issues that I need to accommodate for (gerd and allergies), I see food as fuel to get through the day and keep my body moving. Walking and exercise in general is a hobby of mine and I learned really quickly that I won't have the best performance if I don't eat right, which makes me feel 10x worse about myself and my workout. I was diagnosed in 2021 and because of this, I just don't see the point in restricting as much as before when I'm able to control my diabetes off of minimal exercise and diet alone. Diet and exercise IS something that I had to add as a permanent lifestyle change, but it was easy to add as a lifestyle routine when knowing that I'm doing whatever I can to control my illness puts my mind at ease. When I restricted the most, I was always tired and extremely paranoid as a result--and most likely a nightmare to be around as a friend AND daughter/sister.\n\nHonestly, it all came down to perspective change and slowly reintroducing certain foods into my diet once again that helped me the most. Anytime I get paranoid about my glucose after eating something, I'll take a walk after or check my sugars and it usually eases my anxiety because most of the time, it's normal. Keeping up with my appointments and reaching out to my doctors whenever I had concerns also puts my mind at ease. Journaling is another hobby that I introduced into my life since talk therapy didn't really help me, which I started after tracking my food intake to figure out my triggers. I've also blocked certain tags online, restricted my social media usage on certain apps that triggered my ed, and because of the current state of the world--I've told myself that a little treat here and there won't hurt, especially if I get to associate said treats with nice moments (social events). Food is an important part of my culture and love language (quality time and acts of service), so it didn't feel right to always deny myself of something that I've used to bond with others. Somethings that I've learned to do is asking others if they could accommodate for my dietary restrictions (which most people have been more than happy to do), share half of what I order with others, take leftovers home for later if I really enjoy something but worry about my glucose, prepare my own meals/snacks to bring, and I always carry glucose tablets with me just in case my sugars get low. \n\nOP, I hope that you know that it is possible to recover and that you are not alone in this. It's all going to be a trial and error and I mean, it took me years to finally figure out what works for me. It took me months to realize that my over restriction was the reason why I was always tired and depressed. I used to skip hangouts because I was too tired to get out of bed only to realize that I was headed towards having multiple deficiencies and less energy to even show up for the people that I care about the most. Food started to become apart of my identity and an eating disorder was something that I did not want to be associated with, especially since people around me started to pick up on the fact that it started to become more than just a dietary restriction at that point. Taking up multiples hobbies, going to all my appointments, and spending time with the people that I care about is what helped me recover and stay at a normal weight.\n\n Although I started overweight when I got diagnosed and didn't ever come close to being underweight (but I did lose a lot of weight really fast), I had every symptom of an ED. At this stage of my life, I am too busy with work and school to see food as anything more than just fuel to get me through the day, and whenever I sense a thought to restrict myself again, I remind myself of what my life was like when I restricted, and the anxiety that came with having even more health complications as a result of over restricting. There are many alternatives to foods that are just as tasty, and won't ruin your progress or health. As long as you can fit things into your maintenance and find \"safe\" foods, you don't have to worry. Recovery is possible and it does get easier🐻",

First 2 weeks the sensor was on my left arm, and I had zero issues, seemed to match up pretty closely with finger prick readings. \n\nBut when I went to my second sensor I placed it on my right arm, at the upper back of the arm, and I kept getting low readings that were super off with the finger prick. I recorded my info and called and got a replacement. Then I put a new sensor back on my left arm, no issues. \n\nNow it's time for a new sensor, and I'm back to my right arm, I placed it about center between elbow and shoulder on the back of my arm. And I'm once again getting super low readings and alerts. For example it just said I was 3.9 and going low when the finger prick said 6.7. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is my right arm just bad for the sensors? Am I placing it wrong? I'm so lost. ",

I took Ozempic to get my A1C into the mid 5 range. I have since stopped all diabetic medications.  The berberine is the only thing I take now. It's been 17 months off my medications, and my last 4 A1C tests have been 4.6, 4.9, 4.9, and 4.9. \n I exercise 6 days a week. Mostly walking, rucking with 40lbs, calisthenics (body weight exercises), and keep my carbs under 20 grams a day. \nI'm sure the berberine helps out with that. I'm sure my lifestyle does a lot, too. \n I don't want to rely on prescription medication to be healthy.  I was on Ozempic for 1 year.  I ended up putting on 15lbs when I got off. I have since lost that plus another 25 lbs and have gotten much stronger.  \nI'll probably end up taking Berberine for as long as possible.   I understand everyone is different.

He went on to say that, usually there is no harm in taking them (always check for interactions) but in the long-term they won't help.\n\nI do take supplements, but stuff that makes sense, like Iron (as I am deficient), B12, C, Omega 3-6-9.\n\nGood to ask!

    "selftext": "Hey guys! I started taking mounjaro back on September 8th and was placed on 2.5mg once per week. On October 21st I returned to the doctor on a follow-up to see how I was doing on mounjaro and he was very happy with my progress, I also lost 11 pounds between August 14th which was the last time i saw him and October 21st, I was also checked my weight twice when I went to see my Cardiologist twice on September 23rd and October 1st. My doctor seeing my progress decided to increase my dosage from 2.5mg to 5mg per week. \n\nMy question is, should I expect side effects to worsen at first, remain the same, or possibly have lesser to no side effects at all? When I first started mounjaro I was dealing with very bad stomach pain and nausea so I am hoping not to worsen with this increase. Thanks in advance!",

I wished I stayed on 2.5 mg as long as it was working; and later moved up to 5.0mg. I think the medical community is too quick to follow pharma suggestions. Been on 5.0mg for last 15 months.

But the worst is the neuropathy. It's so bad I can barely function, I am in constant excruciating pain from my calves to my toes. I stopped taking it for 6 days and all the pain went away so I started again hoping it wouldn't be as bad but 2 days in and I'm missurable. I cant take it anymore. I was wondering if anyone else had this happen and what did you do? Where you able to find a statin that didn't cause issues? I don't see my doctor tell end of November so for now I'm not taking it again. I had to do 6 rounds of chemo and this stuff rivals that as far as pain level goes. I am a t2 diabetic that's why I'm asking here, we all worry about neuropathy. ",

    "selftext": "I just finished doing bloodwork at the doctor today, and as the title of this post says, my HbA1C is in a great place! 🥹\n\nAs a 39 y/o female with PCOS, hypertension, T2 diabetes, and endometrial cancer (a type of cancer that can be related to insulin resistance issues), I've been working really hard at this for the past few months, so I just wanted to share what I did in case it might be helpful:\n\n- Moderate carb, high protein eating style: Up to about 30-35 grams of carbohydrates per meal, so around 120 grams a day give or take depending on my snack situation that day. Protein at least 150 grams, but I’m not super strict on how much higher than that it goes.\n\n- I've been using a Freestyle Libre 2 CGM since my 11.8 HbA1C lab, and it’s made me much more aware of how foods (and food pairings!) affect my blood sugar. I still keep record of my fasting blood sugar via a fingerprick test though because I've found Libres can be a little inaccurate in the morning depending on whether or not I accidentally slept on the sensor.\n\n- Consistently (but gradually!!!) increased my step count as my way of exercise. Went from around 3,500 steps a day to 5,000, then 6,000, then 7,000, and now I do at least 10,000 steps a day broken into a 5,000 step walk in the morning and a 5,000 step walk at night. \n\n- Made sure to keep on my medication, as I used to have a hard time being organized with my medicine schedule due to depression, but obviously making sure you’re taking your meds at the right time definitely helps!\n\n- If I want to eat something that’s really carb heavy or I know will cause my blood sugar to go up by a lot, I wait until I can eat it with friends. I'm now the \"Do you want to split a slice of cheesecake?\" girl. Portion control, sharing food, and \"saving the other half for later\" keeps me from completely villainizing certain foods.\n\nDoing all of this, I lost about 18kg/40 lbs. since late February in a way that feels less like an unsustainable diet plan and more like a \"Since I eat healthy 98% of the time, it’s okay to have a treat 2% of the time\" realistic way to lifestyle change.\n\nOf course, every person's body, living situation, and schedule are extremely different, so this isn’t the only way to turn your health around, but I hope sharing my experience can be helpful to some of you!",

I can’t avoid seeing how much (or how little) I’ve walked that day and I have hit my step goal every day since adding it. If walking is feeling boring, find something to make it more interesting - audiobooks, inviting a friend or family member, spying on the neighbors’ flowers or holiday decorations, etc etc. There’s research that as little as 2 minutes of walking within 90 minutes of a meal helps blunt BG spikes, though of course walking more than 2 minutes is better :)",

        "body": "My doctor gave me limited advice to exercise more, and to eat a diet including whole grains and low fat.  I was diagnosed T2 about a year ago.  Being honest I was in a really rough mental state for a while and gained about 50 pounds.  She wanted to put me on three medications (cholesterol, insulin, and blood pressure medication.)  At that time my A1C was 6.8.  When I asked about should I check my blood sugar, she said no, because it may stress me out making sense of it.  My feeling honestly was that she wanted to just put me on meds and be done with it, and really hasn't went out of her way to set me up for success.  I am looking for a new doctor who can hopefully provide better insight to living a healthy lifestyle.  \nWhat I did was I started walking 30 minutes almost every day, and then began looking at my diet.  At first, I cut out junk food and began to cook more of my own meals, meaning nothing frozen out of a bag or box. I eat a very low carb diet, where my main source of carbs are from vegetables and as a guilty pleasure I eat a low carb yogurt  (Too Good) is the brand.    \nThirteen months later, I am still learning.  I walk daily, sometimes twice a day.  My Siberian husky keeps me accountable as she loves her walks!  I have begun to exercise regularly with the understanding that muscle mass will help to use more glucose and help to lose weight.  I am down forty pounds at this point.  I will mention that I am not on any medications and my last three A1C checks have been 6.4, 5.9, and 6.2.  I have learned that my own body needs a lot more water than I normally drink, so I am really trying to improve on that.  I do take a few supplements to help boost my efforts.  What I will say is that personally that diagnosis was a soul-crusher.  I felt like personally I failed myself and my family.  I will fully admit that I was depressed and binge eating like each meal was my last. At this point I eat a diet of meat and vegetables, and try to limit my seasonings to salt and pepper as so many prepackaged foods have hidden sweeteners that can spike blood sugar.  Currently I am in a several month weight loss stall, so I have been a bit strict.  In the past month I started testing my blood sugar, out of curiosity, partially because I haven't lost any weight in so long.  I wanted insight to where those numbers were.   \nThis has been a life style change for me, and honestly at this point I don't even look at sugar.  Taking accountability for my physical well being has also improved my mental well being.  After that very long explanation, start walking and eat a whole foods diet is a great start.",

I’m trying to get her back into strength training to build muscle because as you said it’s good for eating up glucose. \n\nSince you said the scale hasn’t changed for you recently I’d be curious to know if you think it might be from gaining muscle? Are you strength training in any form? Especially if you’re predominantly eating meat and veggies I’d imagine you’re getting a solid protein and fiber intake which is a great recipe for building muscle. \n\nAgain huge congrats on all the success you had thus far!!",

In one way, I can understand it, because at least someone taking a medication has some control measures in place.  On the other hand, if I fall off the wagon for a period of time, now she is almost stuck with the aftermath.\n\nMy suspicion of my long plateau was a protein powder that I was adding to my coffee and using to flavor yogurt, having maltodextrin in it, which I am pretty sure I am sensitive to. Being honest, I don't count calories, because I don't want to make myself miserable, and think I was just eating too much. \n\n I have recently started to strength train in the past month, and I am starting to see the scale start to move back down, and my blood glucose levels are improving as well.  I may get a CGM soon, as I want to fill in the gaps of feedback I don't get with finger sticks, which include at night, where my highest blood glucose levels are highest even though it is many hours after eating.  I also want to monitor different foods and their affect on me, as it never hurts to have variety in your diet.\n\nIt's great that your mom enjoys walking, as it is a very underrated tool, What I try to do is go to different places to keep my environment fresh, there are just only so many times walking around the block over and over again is fun.  As I mentioned earlier, besides diet and exercise, I am finding that hydration is really important.

I saw a nutritionist who suggested more changes, and got my A1c down from 7.3 to 6.8. I started using a CGM a few months after that, and found more changes to make. Then I went nuts on Amazon, \"buying\" every free healthy cookbook I could find. I settled on a low-carb rotation for us, and got my A1c down to 5.8 after stopping my Metformin. I wrote a post outlining the steps for getting free cookbooks and what we eat during a typical month. When I say free, I mean free for a lifetime, not part of the Kindle Unlimited subscription. There's always something available to purchase at a 100% discount, and each one typically has 200 to 1,000 recipes.\n\nThe sales are always changing, so keep checking.

My doc says I got the news early enough that I don’t need to start medication (my A1C was a 4.6, fasting glucose was 85, but my glucose tolerance test hovered above 200 for hours). No antibodies. It’s type 2, probably caused by PCOS and an extremely poor diet.\n\nMy new diet has been OK so far. I’m eating around 50 carbs a day and I prioritize protein above the other food groups because I work out (strength training/walks). I’m not being super careful about cholesterol because keeping that below 200mg a day was making me lose weight like crazy (went from 125-108). \n\nHere’s the deal. Idk what changed but the food noise has been catastrophic recently. I cannot think about anything besides food. I get so depressed while I’m in the middle of a meal, because I know it will end. Wanna hear how dramatic this gets? Word:\n\nI literally daydream about getting diagnosed with something fatal so that I can just fucking eat. It’s giving me panic attacks. I’m losing sleep. I’m not hanging out with my friends or family because I know they’ll be snacking. Yesterday I felt suicidal because the constant need for food is so overwhelming I feel like I can’t take it anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have this issue? What does a girl do lol!!

Im not sure where you live but I have never heard of a t2 diagnosis with an a1c that low because the typical criteria for diagnosis is A1C being above 6.5 or 7. Honestly it doesn't sound like this Dr is helping you? You don't really need to lose weight OR lower your a1c so I'm not sure why the extreme diet restrictions. Managing pcos would be more helpful, which from the sounds of it means you need to eat more. Not just more of anything but specifically protein, fiber and a balanced amount of carbs to keep the food noise down. Your body is telling you it's hungry. Depriving your brain of carbs isn't always the answer. We use them for everything, even just thinking uses carb/sugar stores for energy. This is all just my opinion. It sounds like this Dr doesn't have knowledge of pcos and is trying to treat you as a t2, but even then your a1c is not high so there's not a need for extreme restrictions. I would ask about specifically being treated for PCOS. Ofcourse this doesn't mean you aren't diabetic or won't become diabetic as many with pcos develop type 2. But your treatment plan seems like it's not fitting your actual test results and symptoms.",

Or just add a relatively low carb protein shake with unsweetened peanut butter or some MCT oil blended in as a snack…that could easily be another 400 calories depending on how you make it. ",

I recently talked to my mom about her diagnosis and what information she got from her doctor at the time and was stunned at the little guidance she received. She was simply told “eat better” and referred to a nutritionist to learn what food works best with her meds. For about 6 months in the last year I took her to the gym with me to do strength training and she saw a lot of improvement but she’s now on a GLP-1 after a spike in her A1-C likely due to her no longer working out and falling back into old eating habits for a while. \n\nCurious what other people’s experiences were like in terms of the guidance received from doctors once diagnosed? Did you find it helpful, over or underwhelming, supportive??",

As I aged I did stop weight training.  I cook most of my own food as I love cooking and I have been reading labels for many many years.  I seldomly eat junk food (think 2-3 bags of regular size Cheetos in one year) but I do love good sourdough bread, real bagels, sushi and pho.  After I was diagnosed I eliminated all those **immediately**. And whatever food I have at home that are not diabetic friendly I either threw out or gave them away.  I did have to change my diet because now I need to consume more proteins to get the calories as well as using it to slow down the absorption of carbs (which mostly comes from leafy greens). \n\nI am learning how my body reacts to different foods by checking my blood sugar using a glucometer.  I don't have a CGM and I don't want one because there are too many cons IMO. (I know I am in the minority.)  Basically. anytime I introduce a new type of carbs that are not leafy veggies, I test with a small serving and see how my blood glucose is a few hrs later. So for example I do that for quinoa, air popped popcorn (as a snack), pearl barley etc.  Then I test again to confirm if it was a safe food.  I also do it for serving size.  \n\nI have never felt overwhelmed.  Knowledge is power and I love learning, testing and concluding.\n\nI also just recently got my Hba1c result. It has dropped 45% from when I was first diagnosed.  So I am happy with the progress and I look to improve in 3 months time.  I have also started weight training again in hopes that it will help my body burn more sugar.",

I had an appointment with the pharmacist and got my remaining questions answered. \n\nSo, to answer your question, I think most GPs/PCPs don’t have much in-depth knowledge about diabetes. They can present prescription options and refer to specialists (dietician, endocrinologist, clinical pharmacist, etc) but I think in most cases they’re not going to offer a great deal of direct support themselves.

I’m on 25 units of long acting insulin as well as 2k mg metformin / 4 mg glimepiride.  Some mornings it just goes to 275 for what seems like no reason. I know the dawn phenomenon is a thing but I’d expect it to get better after this amount of time. I’ve also lost like 60 lbs and am at 220 currently. When on insulin I gain weight like crazy… one reason I’m trying to cut back a lot on that. I used to take over 150 units of short acting a day. I walk 15k-25k steps a day. I’ve tried glp1 drugs but those give me the world’s worst heartburn. What else could be wrong with me? ",

I felt like controlling my diabetes was pointless (but that's a little dark, so we wont dive into my reasoning). Years later, I went to the doctor thinking I had a UTI (sorry if thats tmi). However, my blood sugar was the real culprit, over 500. They didnt give me a hard number. They just said I might have to be admitted, but ultimately let me go home. Shortly after that, I lost my insurance, and I was in a dark place for a bit. But 6 months ago I got insurance again, and my a1c was 10.2. I quit drinking cherry coke and started taking mounjaro and got very ill so unfortunately we had to discontinue the mounjaro. At my 3 month recheck my a1c had gone up to 10.7. I had been replacing my beloved cherry coke with snacks, and not good ones. So I saw a diabetic educator. I got a CGM. They put me on metformin (er!), glipizide, and pioglitazone. I made changes to almost everything I'm eating and I'm starting to exercise. At my last 3 month check my a1c was 5.6, and I can't wait to see what I'll do with the next 3 months. ❤️",

I’m just kind of at a loss rn and I don’t even know where to begin… can anyone recommend a good resource for type 2 meal plans. Any tips or pointers for someone new to this whole thing? The sucky thing is I live in a really rural area right now so I don’t have a lot of options or things available to me like I would in the city.\n\nI’ve started taking Metamucil along w my meds, but my blood sugar is still pretty high, I’m still getting the Me Myself and Irene level cottonmouth and going pee a million times at night, among other things and now I’m paranoid about being in ketoacidosis, am I just tripping? Is that something I should be worried about, and how do I test for that without going to the Dr? This sucks.",

I am T2 (5 years now) and have discovered that trying to eat Keto is helping a lot to stabilize my blood sugar levels. I have also found that wearing a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) is VERY helpful in determining in real-time what foods spike my levels more than others. There are TONS of YouTube videos about diet and management of T2. Drink lots of water. I know it may seem counterintuitive since you are already getting up to go pee several times during the night, but once your levels come down, it will get better. Try to get in a little of exercise (this is my weak area) Get used to testing your blood (with the prick test) once or twice a day to keep track of your progress, especially if you are concerned with DKA. It will take a few weeks for the Metformin and insulin to really start working. I am taking 2,000 mg of Metformin a day plus 2mg dose of Ozempic once a week.",

No meds and a1c in the normal rage. I had a great 20s, ate at great restaurants, out several times a week in London and loved life. I’m now in my mid 30s and reasonably under control with my diabetes\n\nThey’ve caught you (us) early. Take action to get to a good baseline and use that as a platform.",

Make changes slowly.\n\nTake the time to learn all about carbs and how they affect your sugar levels. At the same time, keep track of the things you enjoy eating and see how those affect your numbers. \n\nI recommend the channel \"Beat Diabetes\" with Dennis Pollock. He does a great job explaining things. \n\nPeople don't want to accept it, but carbs really are the main issue. This doesn't mean you have to go zero carbs, but the less you consume, the better. However, diabetes is a very personal disease, so your tolerance will vary greatly from everyone else. You may be able to eat things that some folks can't... For example, potatoes don't really spike me, so I can have them in moderation. Eventually you'll know exactly what you can and can't have. And you know what? You can treat yourself once in a while too. The important thing here is moderation!\n\nIt'll be a longish process, but I think if you truly take the time to learn about the disease, how certain foods affect your numbers, and you take it one day at a time, you'll be just fine. It's not a race. It's a lifestyle change.\n\nThere'll be days when you wanna say \"fuck that, I'm tired of this shit!\" and that's ok. Allow yourself to feel your feelings. Just dust yourself off and get back on the saddle. \n\nGood luck and don't hesitate to come to this sub with questions etc!",

        "body": "Apologies in advance if this is too bitter of a pill:\n\nFor me, one of the the biggest things was identifying who in my life was toxically positive, and never talking to them about my diabetes. I had one friend who said she did a \"no carb detox\" and she never felt carb cravings again. She regaled me with stories about how she would eat an apple, and the sweetness from the apple felt sickeningly, cloyingly sweet. She said that after her detox, just having a single bite of an apple was more than enough dessert. A single dark chocolate truffle would be enough to satisfy her sweet cravings for a week because she simply couldn't handle any more sugar than that.\n\nAnother friend told me that she envied me, because now I was going to finally experience swiss chard for the first time, and she wished she could have the great privilege of eating chard for the first time once again.\n\nAnd I was like... WTF? I went weeks and weeks feeling like something was wrong with me, because I've never come around to chard. I've never gotten to the point where I eat spinach and say \"I never understood the natural sweetness in these green vegetables! Spinach really is nature's Snickers bar!\" I've had apples since then, and I have never once found an apple to be sickeningly sweet, like it was made of pure sugar.\n\nNone of the \"great reset\" I was told to expect ever materialized. And over a year out from my diagnosis, I'm virtually certain that I am never going to look at a green lettuce the way I look at a piece of apple pie. I just do not think it is going to happen (but it has happened to people I know, and I guess... great for them).\n\nListening to my friends who go on and on about how improved their lives are after diabetes just... makes me crazy. They all tell me that I have a defeatist attitude, because I insist on seeing diabetes as a bad thing, but I genuinely think I'm happier without them. They have \"keto competitions\" where they \"race\" each other to see who can have fewer carbs in a week. Lowest carbs wins bragging rights. And I guess that's totally fine for them? But it is just not for me.\n\nProbably my A1C numbers would be better if I were more like them (I must sadly admit) but I truly believe that if I tried to get too far into their head space, I would fail and just feel like shit about myself. So my numbers are not great, but I think I'm actually happier if that makes sense. (I know; how can I be happy if my numbers are not great? Maybe this is cognitively dissonant. I have no good answers.)",

I started losing my eye sight and I just didn’t take care of myself. Finally went to the dr. I WISH I had gone to the doctor at 22!\n\nA1C was 13. I was told I needed a double hip replacement due to cartilage deterioration from high blood sugar and I started medication injections in my eyes for retinopathy.\n\nI refused to get a hip replacements because I was only 32 years old. Instead, I hired a personal trainer three days a week and over a 5 year period I lost 120lbs. I also found that I love running and biking.\n\nI started doing smaller triathlons, trail running, and half marathons, and then completed a half Ironman. Since 2018 I’ve completed over 50 races!\n\nAt 44, Im in the best shape of my life.\n\nWhat pushed me was losing eyesight and mobility. Please don’t let that happen. Find motivation in something you love. You’re so young and you’ll find new things to enjoy. Please don’t let things progress to where I did. Let that be motivation for you. \n\nI have the most amazing friends that have encouraged me and supported me; that helps more than anything. \n\nI eat low carb / very low sugar. Being heathy and fit, and not wanting to go blind or have other major health issues, keeps me motivated everyday. \n\n- Eat low carb and cut refined sugars out. \n- Find the right medications. Look into Invokana. \n- Exercise. Play disc golf, bike, walk trails. Keep moving. \n- Find supportive friends and talk to them about your diagnosis and how you want to fight it. \n- Drink water. \n\nYou found out young. Thats a great thing!

But then I did heavy research, talked with people who successfully reversed/ did remission, and consulted over 8 doctors. I figured out that with low carb diet, mounjaro or normal insulin, you can keep your A1C in check but the disease keeps getting worse and worse. T2D is caused by insulin resistance, your body is secreting enough (normally) insulin but your cells have developed the resistance, so taking more insulin is actually counterproductive in terms or the disease. So I started working on my insulin resistance itself. Intermittent fasting, exercise, mostly plan based diet with whole foods and no refined carbs. My diet contains around 110g protein 100g carbs and 20-40g good natural fat. I exercise 4 times a week. Follow my sleep schedule at least 5 days a week. In like 2 months my insulin sensitivity improved as my required insulin dose kept going down, I lost around 4kg of fat whilst retaining most of the muscles, I do consume some dessert and or a sugary beverage like once every 2 weeks and my sugar spike is getting better and within 1.5 hrs my sugar levels come back to around 110-120.  With low carb diet, your disease is still there, e.g. some studies have shown that low carb diet for more than 3 months actually worsens your body’s ability to digest carbs, and the sugar spikes after carbs gets worse. I am not a doctor, I am just telling you what worked for me.",

        "body": "That’s an exciting goal, congratulations on preparing for your black belt test. Six hours of martial arts grading definitely qualifies as endurance-level activity, and it’s great that you’re already managing your blood sugar well with metformin and consistent habits.\n\n“Carb loading” for endurance athletes is usually meant for people doing events that last several hours at a competitive intensity, and even then, it’s more about ensuring energy availability than eating a massive amount of carbohydrates. For someone with type 2 diabetes, the focus is more on steady fuel rather than big spikes.\n\nYou might find that eating balanced meals with a mix of complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats the day before works better than trying to overload. During the grading, quick snacks that digest easily, like a banana, a few nuts, or a small energy bar can help keep your energy up without sending your glucose soaring.\n\nIf your blood sugar climbs during exertion, that’s actually common; stress hormones and adrenaline can push it higher temporarily. Most people find it returns to baseline once the activity ends and hydration kicks in. Since your event is close, you might want to test your response during practice sessions this week so there are no surprises on the day.\n\nYou’re clearly well-prepared and paying attention to your body, which is exactly what keeps things safe and effective for big endurance efforts like this.",

The fasting thing is BS from the likes of Jason Fung, the kidney specialist who decided that writing about diabetes was more profitable than kidneys.  Much of his second book, the 'Diabetes Code', and the notion that you need to fast to lose weight, is total BS.  So is much of everything else written about fasting in relation to diabetes.\n\nJust eat less food.  Calories matter.  Sure, fasting causes a person to eat less food in a day but it's also a gimmick. If you want to eat three meals a day do just that, but keep calories in mind.  Intermittent fasting is only effective if you end up eating less food in a day.  It's magical thinking, where stuffing yourself with food between certain hours is magically better than eating the same amount of food spaced out over the course of a day.\n\nPersonally I like to eat a little something in the morning.  I also like to eat a little something before I go to bed if I feel very hungry, so I can get to sleep.  This is practical, non-magical weight loss.  If you prefer the magical rules from some arcane book, do that, but know that 'intermittent' anything is just a way to convince you to eat less food over the course of a day.  If you like you can just eat the same amount of food any time you like in any 24 hour period and get the same results.",

I started checking my blood sugar every morning when I woke up, changed my diet, am on metformin 1000 mg a day, and just took my third dose of mounjaro 2.5 this morning. I haven’t been checking my blood sugar levels during the night very often, but decided I should do so tonight. I ended up with my lowest level I’ve ever seen, which was 104. This was about 2-3 hours after dinner and I had a few bites of ribs probably an hour before this as well.\n\nMy blood sugar levels in the morning (so fasting levels) have been in the 118-130 range for the last 10 days or so. When I was diagnosed, I had been in the 170s. I am just wondering if it’s normal to see a lower number at night even after eating? I am super happy to see 104 since it’s by far the lowest I have seen, but was just incredibly surprised and expecting it to be much higher. \n\nThanks for any thoughts or comments helping a newbie out!

        "body": "When I (33F) was in my late 20s, I had undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes. It honestly took my hair starting to fall out for me to realize something was seriously wrong. That was my wake-up call to cut out sugar and start getting my life together.\n\nAt the same time, I started seeing a psychologist because I was afraid of taking medication and also had some untreated mental health issues. (Not saying that’s your situation, OP, but therapy really helped me get unstuck and start taking care of myself.)\n\nOnce I worked through that, I was finally able to make and keep medical appointments. I found a doctor who actually listens and works with me. I started on metformin and Solostar for a while — it sucked, but it got my blood sugars down enough to make it easier to stay on a lower-carb diet.\n\nTaking my meds consistently was still hard at first, mostly because of my mental health, but over time I learned to give myself grace and keep trying. Eventually, my labs improved, and my doctor slowly reduced and discontinued some of my meds.\n\nMy blood sugars got stable, but my weight stayed high. My doctor later added Mounjaro to help with weight management, and I’ve lost about 30 pounds so far. More importantly, I’m eating way healthier now and actually feel good about my habits.\n\nOne big thing I struggled with was the going back and forth between doing great and falling off. What really helped me was focusing on one change at a time.\n\nHere’s how it went for me:\n\nFirst, quit smoking.\nThen, cut sugar.\nThen, work on mental health.\nThen, focus on taking meds and keeping appointments.\nNext, swap high-GI carbs for lower ones.\nThen, cook more and eat out less.\nThen, add more veggies and cut energy drinks.\n\nEveryone’s list will look different, but the key was starting with the highest impact and building slowly. For example, I used to eat white bread toast with butter for breakfast. Instead of quitting toast altogether, I just asked, “What’s one small swap I can make to make this a little better for my blood sugar?” Then once that stuck, I moved on to the next thing.\n\nIt’s been a slow process, but a sustainable one. I’m still a work in progress, but I feel like I actually have control of my health now.\n\nWhatever path you take, OP, I’m wishing you good health and success, even small progress is still progress.",

This is because of inflammation but also due to your kidneys trying to flush your system constantly. This is partly why unexplained weightloss can be a symptom of diabetes. \n\nSo yes, diabetes can cause hair loss, because you can become malnourished.

I've noticed less urge to rush to a toilet at times throughout the day.",

I was 18 months researching the root cause, reading a great number of scientific research papers as  I refused to accept the daily blood testing and uncertain future. I was shocked that nobody knows the root cause of Type 2 Diabetes. It seems the insulin receptors are embedded in the cell wall which is made of fat. So I concluded that it is very important that this is natural fat to ensure the insulin receptors work as intended (avoid insulin resistance) and not industrial fats from vegetable (seed) oils etc. So I eat lots of natural fats and avoid industrial fats.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I’ve been a T1D since I was 11 (13 years now), and lately I’ve been thinking about how different every single day is with diabetes even when things are constant, haha\n\nRight now I’m on insulin pens and dose based on my current blood sugar plus what I’m about to eat using my insulin to carb ratio. Some days everything is just right – blood sugar is great, I feel good, and it’s like I’ve cracked everything. Other days even the same meals, similar activity lead to completely different results. The insulin doses I take varies every day and at times variation is too high too for example when I sleep well, eat well vs when I do not sleep well and eat well\n\nI’ve gotten curious and too controlling about all the little variables – for example the timing of my food, what I am eating, what kind of exercise I am doing and when, whether I have slept well or not, am I anxious/ stressed. There are numerous combinations of these variables and all of them seem to have different impact\n\nI’d love to hear about your day-to-day:\n\n* What does your typical decision-making look like? (Whether you’re on pens, pump, Omnipod, or use wearables like CGMs, Whoop - I use this, Oura, Apple Watch etc)\n* How do you figure out what works for you – trial and error, patterns you’ve noticed, advice you follow?\n* Do you track anything beyond blood sugar? What are the best ways you use that info? I have seen that my HRV and blood sugars are kind of correlated. Poor HRV leads to bad sugar levels and vice versa. Poor HRV is also a function of poor sleep, so poor sleep –&gt; poor HRV –&gt; poor sugar levels - this process at times lead to a vicious cycle where I make poor food choices if not in a good mental state or just tired\n* How often do you reach out to doctors/ care coordinators/ nutritionist on a day to day basis? If not, do you feel the need to reach out to help you make better decisions and understand your body better? Do you use any resources or apps to help you make these decisions, if yes, how often?\n\nI’m really just curious about how other people approach this since we all seem to develop our own systems over time. Whether you’ve been at this for decades or are newer to it, I’d love to learn from your experience!",

I am also on several medications plus supplements.\n\nCurrently using the Libre 2 along with GlucoDataHandler so I get the numbers on my Galaxy Watch.\n\nI live in a house where nobody else is diabetic and can pretty well eat whatever they want so we have junk food along with A LOT of carbs. It can be VERY challenging to avoid it. First because it will spike my blood sugar and second, the calories + carbs as I'm trying to stay on a strict calorie deficit.\n\nI use LoseIt to plan my meals, enter into it what I'll probably have for lunch/dinner/snacks then see how much insulin I need to cover those inevitable spikes.\n\nGo for an A1C every 3 months and meet with my endocrinologist right after. No need to see a GP regularly for diabetes anymore, I can usually find what I need online and what I can't I'll make notes and speak to my endocrinologist when I see them.\n\nWent for diabetic counselling a few times since diagnosed, but they've never really helped me much. I already know what they were telling me, and the refreshers don't give me anything new. There are so many tools available online now that I find them a resource that's really meant for newer diabetics, at least, IMO.\n\nIn addition to all that, the only thing that has really helped me has been intermittent fasting. Daily 16:8 and I'm trying to put back OMAD into the mix.\n\nI try to eat a lot of fruit - Hami Melons (with the green/white part -- lots of fibre), Apples, Plums, Berries, Bananas, Mangoes, etc., I know some are high in sugar, but it's not like drinking your sugars (sodas).\n\nAlso trying to eat more vegetables - Okra, Eggplant, Sweet Potatoes, Asian Cabbage, Bok Choy...\n\nI've found solace in Asian or Asian inspired dishes since they are all high in protein, and except for the noodles low in carbs.\n\nWhen I opt for standard cuisine, I still make a lot of my own food especially sauces, dressings and deserts (amazing what you can do with cottage cheese).\n\nEverything I'm doing is *finally* working. My A1C has been hovering around 6.5 for the last year or so.\n\nPrior to this it was always in the 7s, or 8s because I was using insulin + medication as a crutch to eat whatever I wanted.\n\nIn terms of exercise, I do these:\n\n* Cycling - 15km - 30km 2x to 3x per week\n* Walking 5km - 10km 2x to 3x per week\n* Strength Training 2x per week\n\nI try to keep one day as a rest day.\n\nI've also recently started taking swimming lessons.\n\nI still struggle with sleep, I stay awake too late and also use a CPAP as I was diagnosed about one-two years ago as having sleep apnea and my numbers were very bad.\n\nAnother thing that's helped me is having an accountability buddy. I post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/), but also chat with my friend regularly. We keep each other in check when it comes to managing our diabetes and weight loss.",

They are the first indicator for me that I’ve spiked- within ten min of them my monitor is going off with a high glucose alert. This type of headache lasts until I manage the spike, ten minutes if I walk it off but up to 30 or so minutes if I have to wait it out. \n\nWhen my bg is “low” my head sensation is also the first indicator but it’s more of a swimming loopy feeling, no pain.

Cue dramatic music …\n\nIf you haven’t seen one of my posts by now, which might be impossible because I’ve asked a million questions, I’m new to this T2 deal. My diet has been OK for the most part. Carb-wise it’s been very good. That switch was surprisingly not super hard. However, I could probably do better in the sodium/cholesterol department…\n\nMy question is: I’ve heard of some folks treating themselves with a cheat meal now and again. Would it be horrible if I treated myself to a slice of cheesecake on my birthday? \n\nI have insulin resistance. I know that the reading would not be satisfactory afterward. But is that OK once a year?\n",

                "body": "NOTE: All numbers are mg/dl \n\nFirst, I want to explain what I consider treats (I also classfied them as cheats). These are foods I know I should not have because it will spikes my blood sugar to well over 200+ even after 2 hours.  So some examples are real sugar desserts, traditional white bread/bagels, white rice/rice noodles.  With those numbers, even with multiple injection of fast acting insulin, it will take me a good day to get it back down to a number that I like (no more than 120).  Without fast insulin it will likely take longer plus a restriction of carbs on meals and no snacks until it gets back down to my self imposed acceptable numbers.  So to me, that is absolutely not worth it. \n\nThis is not to say I don't have foods I like or try new things.  For the latter, if there is something I want to try, I will wait until my numbers are really good before the meal (no more than 90), then I can try a small serving and see how my body reacts.  I give enough buffer and small portion size to hopefully, even if it spikesm it doesn't go above 150.  My next food test is going to be on yukon gold potatoes.  I just recently tried quinoa and 50g (cooked) is definitely an ok portion.  \n\nAdditionally, I don't eat the sugar free, no added sugar ice cream etc because I have tried them before when I was not diabetic yet. To me, it just taste awful, so there is no point of eating them.  \n\nNow for foods that I do love, specifically fruits, I just need to make sure I have a sensible (to me) portion.  It is a far cry from what I use to consume but I have them at least once a day, most days I have it twice. One after lunch and one after dinner.  I also do an occasional square of 90% dark chocolate.  \n\nConsequently, I never felt deprived on foods and thus I don't need a treat.  Hope this make sense.",

As long as it’s once a year.  Plan around it.   Eat a high protein low carb meal, drink lots of water. Walk before and after dinner.  All those things will help your sugar go up less.

    "selftext": "I'm trying to figure out whether I should be worried or not. I was diagnosed 4 months ago with T2. Since then I've been on Mounjaro and Metformin and not only dropped 20% of my body weight, but my A1C is back down to 5.0 and my fasting glucose was 70 at my last bloodwork. I seem to be a GLP-1a superresponder, which is pretty miraculous.\n\nThe problem is that the same bloodwork detected trace ketones in my urine and since then I've been measuring with strips both before and after eating and persistently have trace to small ketones with &lt;125 mg/dl finger sticks. According to sources, EDKA is normal blood sugar with \"high\" ketones. But does that mean ANY ketones are \"high\"? Or does that mean, like, dark purple test strips?\n\nComplicating things is that we are trying to figure out what else is wrong with me--I live with idiopathic hypersomnia (diagnosed 8 years ago) and take Xywav at night, which means I have to stop eating 4 hours before bedtime. Nevertheless, I still feel terrible from sleepiness/fatigue and blood tests keep finding new anomalies (including positive ANA), so there is SOMETHING else wrong with me, but we don't have it figured out yet.\n\nI'm not doing a ketogenic diet--I consume ~135 g of carbs every day, including vegetables, fruits, and bread. I am, as I said, fasting 12-13 hours (4+ hours before bed+ 8 hours in bed), which I thought could explain the ketosis, but even after eating two pieces of toast and other carbs I still have trace ketones.\n\nI'm concerned I could be at risk for EDKA. I obviously have fatigue, lethargy, lack of focus, and malaise because I *always* have them from the hypersomnia and whatever mystery illness I may have. Nausea is occasional, as is loss of appetite, but those are both also associated with Mounjaro and Metformin. I've had facial flushing since I was a child, so that doesn't tell me much, either. \n\nI read that EDKA can be caused by other underlying conditions, and we're looking for them. I really don't want to go on insulin but I also don't want to die from something treatable. So, long story short (too late) how many ketones before I start worrying?\n\n",

Warm Epsom salt soaks, with caution! Use warm, not hot water\n      1. In the winter, when I get back from a walk, I use Epsom salt soaks to rest my feet. I bought one of those foot soak thingies from WM last Christmas and love it. I don't have neuropathy, but do what I can to take care of my feet as I enjoy walking/cycling.\n\nThere are other things you could try like topical relief such as capsaicin creams or patches, other topical analgesics, TENS or heat/infrared/phototherapy -- but I've never tried this, and never spoke to my endocrinologist about this, I've only read about it.\n\nFinally supplements and nutrients - but use caution!\n\nI've read the ALA may help, but there is no definitive proof. B vitamins are something else to try, especially if B12 is low but if its normal then this may not help (again, this might help, never any guarantees) and finally antioxidants or neuroprotective supplements.\n\nBefore trying supplements or topicals - ask your doctor, you don't want to do more harm than good.\n\nI read about ALA/B12 here: [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/natural-diabetic-neuropathy-treatment](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/natural-diabetic-neuropathy-treatment)\n\nHope this helps or gets you looking for more resources!",

My doctor put me on metformin, and I have lost 15 pounds since (down at least 33 in last 18 months) and am eating smarter, cutting down on carbs and sugar. I bought a blood sugar meter and my numbers have looked good -- mostly in a non-diabetic range, and I've seen only a couple spikes over 200, and nothing higher than 221 -- and I'm getting an A1C test next week. I was laid off in May, and my doctor said my system might have went into warrior mode from the stress.\n\nHere's my question: Is anyone enrolled in the Teledoc diabetes management program? It's apparently a benefit of my health insurance, and I got something in the mail saying I'm eligible and can receive a free meter, strips, and lancets, as well as an app to track everything. It sounds legit, but I'm skeptical it's not Teladoc trying to market more of its services or get my health data, or that it's my usually good insurance trying to nudge me toward telehealth visits. Cynical? Yeah, perhaps, but I'm not sure free strips is worth whatever tradeoff (if any) is expected",

I get labs done frequently through my psychiatrist. In June my glucose levels were high but before that they’ve been fine. I’ve been eating a lot healthier since I got that result and have lost weight. Since Monday I’ve felt awful and the symptoms line up with diabetic symptoms. Did anyone go from being in a normal range to full type 2 diabetes in just a few months? I’ve tried googling timelines but most sites imply it develops slowly. Hearing anyone’s experience would be appreciated. ",

So now I’m having an issue where even when I don’t eat very much or stick to things like apples and protein bars, my numbers will still go high so that then if I actually eat a regular meal they shoot up. I seem to be shaky no matter what I do, and I’m afraid to eat anything/very much in case I have a spike. I’m not really sure how I should be managing this. I also have a cold right now - could that be contributing to the high numbers? Feeling kind of frustrated and also hangry all the time. ",

I never could (I probably can now since I have reduced my insulin resistance).\n\nFirst of all apples fiber is in the skin, so if you removed that you only eat carbs and that ain't good.\n\nSecondly apples and fruit in general is better tolerated at the end of a meal rather than as a snack. Which I have the impression is how you eat apples.\n\nProtein bars (most) are too carb heavy for T2 and are better had with some fiber in the stomach already... Which defeat the purpose of having them bars in the first place so unless you find the good ones with little carbs best stay away from them or even better you could make your own Protein bars (plenty of receipes on line) at least you are certain they have no hidden carbs.\n\nFor snacks if you really have to have fruit, berries are your best bet.. But I'd prefer a handful of nuts (peanuts are not really nuts) or cheese.\n\nAlso check on line the glicemic index of the food you normally eat to have an idea, and see if alternatives are more suitable for you.",

Everyone’s body responds uniquely to different specific foods. The one thing we all have in common is that we cannot process carbohydrates efficiently. Lower the carbs and spikes enough and add some light intermittent fasting and you’ll see the numbers come down.\n\nI brought my numbers down (a1c down to 5.4 from 10.2) over a year of eating very low carb. Started adding some carbs back a few months ago and, due to general stress, watching my country be dismantled stress, and messing with my metabolism too much, I succumbed to carb-creep and was eating way too many for a while. Now I’m adjusting again to lower and maintain. I’d NEVER go back to eating carbs with abandon, but I was eating too many for me- so my a1c is about 5.8 at the moment. Not terrible but certainly not where I want to be. No meds, 60 yrs old",

I recently switched from Glipizide to Mounjaro because of the lows I was getting. Since making the change, it’s been amazing. My lows are basically nonexistent now, and my overall glucose numbers have dropped and stayed more consistent.\n\nI’ve been on Mounjaro for about a month and a half, currently in week 2 at 5 mg, and things just keep improving. I’m really hoping I can stay at this dose since it seems to be working so well.\n\nThe only downside so far has been some nausea after injections, but it’s manageable and I’m hoping it fades over time as my body adjusts.\n\nHas anyone else here moved from Glipizide to Mounjaro? How did your transition go, and did the nausea eventually settle down for you?\n",

Before, you could hardly even tell I was diabetic! I’m wondering what’s causing these and, of course, I’m becoming a bit nervous. To combat these readings, I’ve started upping my exercise to &lt;10,000 steps a day, with my usual strength training. This helps during the exercise, but then my sugars start creeping up again … \n\nI’m wondering if it’s stress related. I am a naturally anxious person and this new diagnosis has not helped. I also haven’t been sleeping properly.\n\nI didn’t know what your guys’ experiences were with variations in sugar because of stress/sleep issues. If you want to share, please do!",

Do you move around or sit most of the day? Do you do any phisical activity? Do you sleep OK? Are you worried most times? Do you like/accept yourself?

AND get  an a1c, fasting insulin (so that you can get a HOMA-IR baseline reading to know exactly how insulin resistant you are) and a c-peptide.

That's not what I need to do, so the wiser choice would be to have a meal that I enjoy, like a correctly portioned meal of some kind of protein with some mashed potatoes and a nice veggie.

I actually got tested to get my DOT Card last Friday and literally just having the dangerous bagel for breakfast and doing literally almost nothing all day came in at 144. And that’s not to shabby at all. I spoke to the PA and when she worked in the ER and hospitals she saw BS in the High 400’s and 500’s!!!! So can I try and probably cut out some more of course. But with what I’m doing the meds (that’s for another post) all is going well. Everything in moderation! And remember what my doctor said. You can eat what you want but make sure you do physical activity to help burn it off!",

Now, my diabetes is not bad, and my A1C has been at 5.0% for a long time so I’m well-managed (aka eating some taters and cookies here and there isn’t doing much, I barely spike anymore).\n\nThe main thing for me is really about two things: the KIND of carbs I’m consuming and WHEN I consume them. Not all carbs are equal. I try to get lots of fibres and good quality carbs that won’t just spike me up or bloat me without benefits. Instead of white bread, I go for sourdough. Instead of white pasta, I go for brown rice-based pasta (which contains tons of fiber and is gluten-free), etc. Complex carbs will do more for you than processed bleached crap. Of course it’s all about balance. I find what helps to reduce my hunger before a meal is to get some fibers in FIRST, either chugging Metamucil if I’m lazy, or chomping on a bunch of veggies before my main plate. That way it just reduces the amount of carbs I’m even capable of consuming.\n\nI like to eat carbs after physical activity, and in the morning when I know I won’t be eating much lunch at all during work. \n\nThen honestly, sometimes in the weekend I have family dinners or special events here and there and then I literally just eat whatever, in moderation. I’m chomping on real chocolate cake for my bday and that’s just how I choose to live my life.",

Doc says meds aren’t necessary for me at this point. That being said,\n\nMy baseline was hovering between 85-90 for a good while. The main thing was, I wasn’t eating barely any carbs. I was told by my doctor that I have to incorporate more in order to stay healthy, which I agree with in terms of how I felt, so I went from &lt;50 a day to between 70-100 (I don’t think I have gone above 90 in months though to be honest) \n\nI do feel that I’m getting more nutrients now, however, my fasting and baseline have risen to 95-100. Here are my concerns:\n\n1. Could this be the result of me incorporating more carbs into my diet? My body is definitely telling me that I need them, so I’m hesitant to go back to my meat-prominent diet.\n\n2. I sleep like shit, and I’ve been told that can have adverse effects on blood sugar. Has this caused anyone’s fasting/base levels to increase? And if so, have you been able to fix it?\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: I walk at least 8,000 steps a day (after breakfast, at work, and sometimes after dinner) and strength training 3x a week. I usually do not eat more than 30 carbs in one meal, and those I either get from veggies, yogurt, or protein powder",

You're not on any meds and your A1C1 looks pretty good.  \n\n\nYour morning blood sugar looks really good too, maybe look at trying to fit in some exercise more routinely after dinner like a 15 minute walk and add to your steps total for the day and see if that helps lower your morning blood sugar.  \n\n\nSince you've played around with your diet, you may have to adjust your exercise to accommodate those changes too.  Another thing you might want to try is doing your walk before your breakfast instead, some say that boosts your metabolism since you've been fasting overnight.  \n\n\nRegardless, you look to be doing great, you're taking all the initiatives to stay off meds and eventually as you age, it could just be bad genetics where you may need some help but the longer you can prolong it then the better it is for yourself.

        "body": "70 to 180 mg/dL (roughly 3.9 to 10 mmol/L) is the range used by Type 1 diabetics.  Chronic levels above 180 are associated with organ damage.  70 to 140 is the typical range of a healthy person, and is increasingly used by Type 1s as a more desirable target, known as 'tight range'.\n\nThe Stelo and Lingo sensors are marketed at non-diabetics who are interested in their health, and are available over the counter in the US as they are not regulated medical devices considered suitable for informing people who are on insulin therapy.  The medical-grade models such as Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre sensors, and the reporting websites that go with them such as the Clarity site, use the 70 to 180 range by default.\n\nI personally aim for at least 95% of the time in tight range (below 140) and almost 100% of the time below 180, as this is a pattern that a non-diabetic who eats a lot of carbs might see.  Fairly conservative in my view but others might aim for tighter numbers.  It's worth noting that a recently-diagnosed person might not be able to achieve this target range, but through diet, weight loss, exercise and medications they might soon find that it gets much easier.",

Went to the Emergency Room and they tested it at 503. They gave me some IV fluids, I drank a bunch of water, and it was down to 350 a couple hours later. I declined insulin as it was headed in the right direction and was sent home. My glucose has averaged  233 since then.\n\nOn following up with my primary a week later, she said that the high level was odd, but that she wouldn't diagnose me with diabetes or order any tests to follow up, as my A1C in August was 5.9% (pre-diabetic).  I've read the medical research on steroid shots and blood glucose, and the highest reading noted was 500 for a person who had uncontrolled diabetes.\n\nMy question: Should I be pushing harder for some kind of followup?",

    "selftext": "Hello! I was diagnosed type 2 fairly recently (PCOS + 2 GDM pregnancies got me). My doctor prescribed me a CGM patch that is working really well for me. For various reasons I have chosen to keep my diagnosis private from my family members, mainly to avoid being the subject of judgement, gossip, and obsession about my health. I’m seeing my doctor, I’m following the rules, so far it’s well managed etc. etc. I know sharing with certain people will be unhelpful so I’m just keeping it on the DL generally.\n\nMy question is about CGM placement. I know the arm is standard, but does anyone have any experience placing it elsewhere on the body so it’s less visible? I was specifically considering placing it on my glute so it will always be covered. With the holidays coming up I’ll be spending a lot of time with family and I just don’t need this to become a bombshell revelation that then we have to Talk About. I really prefer to keep it private.\n\nAnyway, TL;DR - can I stick my CGM on my ass? ",

I had it tested yesterday. Drumroll please…\n\n8.1. 😂 So hey, at least it’s very clear I’m doing everything I need to do. It just wasn’t quite enough time. I’m fine with that, honestly – the idea of going under the knife in a little more than a week doesn’t thrill me, as there are a lot of things up in the air right now. I think it would be best to wait another month, stay the course, and lose more weight/build my stamina before surgery.\n\nEven so, it was nice to see the actual proof that I’m heading in the right direction. 👍🏻",

I went from 11.4 to 5.9 in about 5 months, which is amazing.\nBut here’s the issue - food is so expensive now, especially meat and alternatives to things I’ve been consuming for months. I have no idea what to eat anymore, and my family’s budget just got tanked to the ground. Everything cheap is higher in carb and I have no idea what to consume when I have to slash tons of money off my budget and feed my whole family in the process. \nI know some carb sources are supposed to be “off limits” and I’m just trying to get things in check without messing up all my progress.\n\nDoes anyone have a bare bones type of grocery list or ideas that I can try to use? I have myself, my husband, and one child to feed. \n\nThanks in advance! \n",

Currently, trying to gain 6lbs of muscle to see if that helps with insulin sensitivity. I was diagnosed back in May and had lost about 10lbs and was 114-116lbs. Endo didn’t take my A1C because when she saw me that 3 month threshold hadn’t hit so my insurance would cover but she said the CGM typically reads higher and it’s currently at 6% for the past 3 months— it was 6% then too. I’m in range 93% of the time. I do my best to stay around 140 post meals but it can go up sometimes because I eat something carb heavy. Glad you’re getting your A1C down. ",

I am unmedicated, walk 10 000 steps a day and try to eat relatively healthy. My usual energy level is quite good. I work fulltime, am in school and have my hobbies. But probably once a month I get hit with this intense exhaustion that can last a day to several days. I feel like I have the flu, as in, I'm too exhausted to breathe but I am not sick. Sometimes it happens when I have my period, other times not. When I check my blood sugar during this time I dont notice anything really different than any other time.\n\nI'm curious if this is something anyone else deals with? Is it diabetes related? Kidney related? Maybe it's unrelated and I'm just burnt out. \n\nI should add, all other blood work is normal aside from glucose but sometimes over the years, my eGFR is normal, sometimes that numbers would indicate mild kidney damage but my doc has never felt concerned about it.\n\nThank you to anyone who shares their experience or any thoughts.",

Even if it’s not always when you’re menstruating, it could be related. \n\nI tend to agree with the other comment that medication would likely help if the exhaustion is related to your BG. 7.3 is a good improvement but with that number you’re either hanging out in moderately high numbers or having big spikes. \n\nRegardless, this sounds disruptive for you and would be worth talking to your doctor to find out your options.",

I wash them, cut root, and then boil until you can pierce easily with fork. From there, you can just mix in a bowl with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, black pepper, and butter. Then smash with fork.\n\nIf you prefer baking, you can cut them in half, mix with rosemary, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic. Place cut side face down on lined baking sheet. 425 for 20 min. Then flip radishes, cut side up, cook for another 15 to 20 min.

I am going it will help me with my weigh and bring down my A1C.\n\nI am really concerned about my feet tho. Every job requires me to be physically active and that affects my feet. I have flat feet and have a few calluses. I also have dryness and also athletes foot.\nI went to podiatrist recently- they gave me a cream.\n\nMy concern is obviously if I am in danger of causing damage to my feet with my lifestyle. \n\nI am not on any meds but I still do struggle to eat right.\nI end up binging and pretty much as I used to but not to that crazy degree. But Definitely I am not 100% good with doing the low carb.\n\nCan you guys share what you went through and if you ended up loosing toes and having surgery? \n\nWhat can we do to make sure we can take care of our feet?\n\nMy current A1C has to be back to 6.3 if not higher.",

And I am sorry if it’s a stupid curiosity. I am simply wondering how this disease affects different folks:\n\nI’ve read a lot about people “ignoring” their diabetes after diagnosis. I suppose my question is: if you are someone who ignored this, and I wouldn’t f*ckin blame you, how did you manage with the swings? Did you not feel terrible? Nauseous? Faint? \n\nI might be misunderstanding what people mean when they say they ignored theirs. But even when I try to do my best with my sugars, I still feel even the most moderate dips and jumps. \n\nThank you!",

While with a run-away T1, that would come to a hard stop with DKA manifesting itself within just some days if not taking any insulin at all.",

Six years later, I fell quite ill rather suddenly. I lost 40 lbs in six weeks and was peeing throughout the day. I was traveling for work and finally got so sick I had to miss a flight. I saw my PCP and my blood sugar was 425. I went back the next morning for a full workup and my A1c was 13.4. He put me on Metformin and told me to eat better. All I did was replace regular soda with diet. Nothing else for the next eight years. I got my A1c down into the 7s.\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, I started to get an inkling that I should change my life. I finally learned how to cook (using an Instant Pot, but still) and started trying what were purported to be healthy recipes. I thought my numbers would improve but my depression and Metformin dosage only kept going up. \n\n\nAbout 18 months ago, my PCP connected me with a nutritionist who suggested some real changes. I made a few of them. Four months after that, I requested a CGM. I spent the next two weeks figuring out what I should and should not eat. Then, a family emergency separated me from my meds for a week. I was surprised that my numbers looked great the entire time. When I got back to my meds, I told myself I can do it, and I never restarted them. \n\n\nFive months later, my A1c came down from 6.8 on maximum medication to 5.8 on no meds at all. When my PCP said, \"Maybe we can now start talking about possibly lowering your meds,\" I replied, \"Good. I stopped taking them five months ago.\" She was shocked by my announcement but agreed that my numbers supported my decision. \n\n\nSo yeah. I ignored my condition for eight years, but all it took was about six months of a concerted effort to get things under control and get off my meds.",

    "selftext": "TW: Miscarriage, TTC\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy husband (M32) and I (F31) both have type 2 diabetes. We’re both on metformin, he’s also on Mounjaro, and our A1Cs are both under 6.0. So, medically speaking, we’re actually doing pretty well.\n\nThe not-so-fun part: we’ve just gone through our 4th miscarriage (all before 10 weeks). Our first loss was before we were diagnosed, but by the second, we both already knew about our diabetes.\n\nHere’s where it gets messy—recently a “friend” told me I should basically give up on trying for a baby because, according to her, our child would be born unhealthy and diabetic, and that God is probably purposely not letting us have kids because we’re “unfit.” (Yes, she really said that. And yes, she’s over 300 lbs herself, so I’m not sure why she felt qualified to hand out health shame coupons.)\n\nThankfully, we’re seeing a fertility specialist now, and she definitely didn’t act like diabetes was the apocalypse my friend is making it out to be. But after hearing that comment, I can’t stop it from creeping into my head.\n\nI’m not even sure what I’m looking for—maybe advice, maybe encouragement, maybe success stories? Just something real from people who’ve been through this, because the more I sit with my “friend’s” words, the more I start to believe them, and I really don’t want to.",

So that *is* something to consider. \n\nBut people live long, healthy, happy lives with this disease, so it's technically not the end of the world. There *are* other risks that come with having children while being overweight, both for the child and for you, the mother, so be sure to talk to your doctor about any concerns you might have.

I don’t eat breakfast, but my 8:00 am reading is always the highest of the day.  I have tried breakfast, snacks, late night snacks. Nothing changes it. As I wake it starts climbing and peaks at 8:00 (if I wake at 6:00.). It then slowly walks down until lunch. Lunch gives me a normal roundish spike, and drops quickly.  Normal bg till dinner. Normal spike after dinner. Within an hour I am back to normal bg.  Under 100 during the night. And then the dawn. That is all according to my CGM. \n\nI have lost about 15 pounds since August.  I weigh my food. I eat less than 50 grams of carbs every day (weighed with a food scale.) Lots of protein and good fats. As much veggies as I can stand. I rotate through 5 meals, none of which cause a spike. (Boring I know.)I lift weighs and do cardio. I average 30,000 steps a day. I run daily. \n\nI’ve done just about all I can with diet and exercise. There is nothing left to tweet there. \n\nI have about 20ish pounds to loss around my stomach. Visceral fat. \n\nIn your experience does dawn phenomenon decrease as I get rid of fat in and around my liver and reduce insulin resistance? My a1c was 8.5 in July and 6.1 a few days ago. \n\nI can maintain my current eating and pace for a few more months to lose this fat. But will it change anything? Or is it unique to the individual?",

Using testing, I’ve been able to figure out exactly what works for me and what doesn’t. I immediately saw improvement in my energy levels, fatigue, and even started losing weight again. \n\nI will also add that my nutritionist suggested that, if there is a food I REALLY want to eat but know it’s going to spike me, to do a quick high-intensity strength workout right after. I have 15 lb dumbbells at home and if I do a bilateral overhead press until I get muscle fatigue (shaky muscles) a couple of times in a row, that helps level out the spike a bit. Her reasoning is that when we put our muscles into fatigue, they’ve used up all of their glycogen stores, so they take sugar from our bloodstream to replace it. There’s probably a better way to explain it but…. That’s the best I can do.",

He's 60 and I'm 59, and were both originally from an Appalachian region, so we're both used to fried potatoes, fried chicken, cornbread, mashed potatoes and gravy, etc.  It would be helpful for me if we would meet with a dietician so I would better understand how to cook for him and how to grocery shop, but he's dragging his feet even though his doctor has referred him to one.  He has been telling me that the dietician our doctor referred him to hasn't called him, so I messaged our doctor today and he gave me the name of the dietician he is sending him to, but my husband doesn't want to meet with this person, in office or through a televisit.  He has **not** been recently diagnosed and is on his last medication before insulin but it's still a struggle.  I threw out his Pop Tarts a couple weeks ago and got him Zero Sugar wafer cookies because he has a sweet tooth.  And they are actually good!  The serving size is three cookies.  He'll eat 12 or 15.  And he sneaks candy bars at work.  Like I said, it's a constant battle.  Anyway, I'm lost and have been looking at diabetes cookbooks for about a week and I think I might like either the Taste of Home Diabetes Cookbook or the ATK Diabetes Cookbook.  I'm leaning towards the Taste of Home cookbook since it was published last year and the ATK cookbook is older, but I'm not sure.  Anyone use either of these cookbooks?  Also, any advice for feeding a diabetic hillbilly would be greatly appreciated.",

Often turning something from high-carb, high-fat to something more reasonable can be done easily.\n\nI've found eating a traditional SE Asian diet (my ancestry) is not good for my diabetes as it's usually high in carbs.\n\nI still eat fried foods - but more like a treat if I've kept my daily carb count low so maybe once per month.\n\nBut baking potatoes, and chicken in an air fryer gives it *almost* a fried taste.  You can find lots of tricks online on giving foods that *crunch* that is soooo satisfying! I know the coatings on chicken add a lot of carbs but if you can keep your daily carbs on the low end (say less than 100g or even 125g) and higher on protein he'll feel satisfied and not hangry. \n\nAll the best!",

    "selftext": "Hey All - So a [short while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1nndyhf/highs_exercise/), I posted about my glucose spiking during exercise.\n\nThis weekend, I went out again:\n\nTotal ride was 37.54km\n\n* Duration 3:04:01\n* Average Speed 12.1 km/h\n* Max Speed 22.3 km/h\n* Average Pace 4:54 min/km\n\nDid a few things differently. As I IF 16:8, this week my fast broke as I was going out. So I had overnight oats + chia seeds soaked in skim milk. I took my medication, including rapid acting insulin and set out.\n\nSo it started high, which I expected but over the next few hours stabilized. \n\nAlong the way, I also had an apple, plus two protein bars.\n\nThe only thing I can think of, after asking one of my friends who is a pharmacist big on understanding diet/nutrition as it relates to diabetes is that the combination of overnight oats + chia seeds soaked in skim milk gave me a steady glucose release versus sharp spike. \n\nAlso during the ride, the apple which is simple sugars gets taken up by the muscles to no significant rise plus the protein bars are high in fibre and protein so a more gradual absorption.\n\nI also took insulin before I went, which probably helped blunt the sharp increase.\n\nBut also, as a few other suggested since I was fasting and muscles needed energy my liver released the stored glucose and I feel it overshot... but can't do much about that. The adrenaline + cortisol also helped elevate my blood glucose and finally no additional insulin to moderate things.\n\nLesson learned - don't participate in exercise which is going to push you without fueling yourself first.\n\nJust wanted to share this with others who may run into issues...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fvedvex06sf1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdef7291bedd21efc8f4b312e655826383b3e54f\n\n",

Even though I already knew that in my mind, I need to keep accepting that at a deeper level over and over again.\n\nBefore diagnosis, with all my losing and gaining back weight, I would slowly just give in and start thinking I’d failed. I think the trick is to get better and faster at getting back on your plan. For me that involves shortening the amount of time I spend beating myself up. I work actively to be kind and gentle with myself, like I would be with a cherished friend.\n\nThink about how far you’ve come and recommit.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone. Before I start i want to say everything that has and will happen to me was absolutely my fault. Ive abused my body for decades, even after my type 2 diabetes diagnosis. I'm talking decades of opioids (prescription), smoking, eating everything i wanted, and so on. Miraculously i was never a drinker, lol. With that, what happened to me was avoidable. I should have pushed harder when the hospital staff was tunnel visioned on my diabetes. \n\nIt starts in February. I was feeling terrible. I lost 20 something pounds, I'm lethargic, and I'm suffering from quite a bit of foot pain. I go to the VA Hospital ER with my complaints, the docs see high blood sugar, give me metformin and send me on my way.\n\nOver the next several months i'm doing worse and worse. I lost another 20 something pounds, my foot is more painful, and everyone thought I was dying. I thought that as well. So come June I went from obese to my minimum healthy weight. I can barely get out of bed. Then, I get severe constipation that is bad enough that I go back to the ER. At this point my blood sugar and A1C levels have reached holy poop levels, and I get admitted. I'm there for 3 days, they give me an insulin prescription, and send me on my way.\n\nDo you know what spikes blood sugar levels? Bone infections! I was home for three days and the swelling began. Then came the redness. Then the swelling became so severe my skin was beginning to tear. This all took around three days. Well, back to the ER convinced I had tendinitis, gout, or both. I figured it couldn't be that bad. The ER blew off my complaints twice already convincing me my only issue was high blood sugar. When I got there the third time the doctors instantly knew what it was. It was too late and I lost my big toe and surrounding area. \n\nSo anyway, please don't let the doctors dismiss you so easily. Sometimes there is much more going on. If my infection was caught in February, I would still have my big toe. If my infection was caught in June, I would still have my big toe. It's still on me, I should have followed up with specialists, but I will say I was too weak to take care of myself at that point. Severe infections don't make for great thinking ability.\n\nPlease, please, please follow up with your symptoms until you've been satisfied. \n\nIronically, I think this probably saved my life. Not just because I am taking things seriously now, but because other issues have been revealed. I need another (third) surgery on my foot, but this time I need my PCP and cardiology clearance. My PCP ordered chest x-rays and I found out I have a fractured rib, lol. You'd think I'd know, lol. Cardiology results are much worse. A chemical stress test revealed i most likely had a heart attack (again, you'd think I'd know), which led to a cardiac catheter. So yeah, lots of blockage and I'm getting scheduled for bypass surgery. My consultation is on the 8th. I lost a toe, and it's just sucked, but it probably helped me avoid an inevitable lethal heart attack. ",

Almond milk, Greek yogurt, cocoa powder, cacao nibs, sugar free granola, frozen fruit, etc. I've added it to (keto) cookies for a bit of extra protein.

Vegan, 400 calories, 40g protein, 23-24g carbs (4-5g sugar, 7-8g fiber) per 17oz prepared serving. I also got an email from them recently that the new formulations coming out this fall will have less sugar and more fiber which is exciting. Note that the non Black Edition powder has much less T2 friendly macros.\n\nIf you can’t get Huel, Orgain is also vegan and more of a straight-up protein powder than a meal replacement. I used to blend it with cold brew to make a chocolate pb latte and that was pretty great. I still buy the little ready to drink cartons sometimes.\n\nOwyn is super low carb and tastes good but the texture is a little slimy.

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with type 2 almost a year ago. I tried GLP-1 but I can’t afford it and my insurance won’t cover it. I just started metformin 500mg just once a day. The constant diarrhea and nausea is a lot worse than I expected. I’m only taking one pill a day!! My glucose numbers are pre diabetic when fasting and normal levels after eating and we are waiting for my A1C to come back. Should I get a second opinion? Any advice on handling such I low dose of metformin? I was drinking heavily when I was first diagnosed. I also had gestational diabetes with both of my kids. \n\nEdit: I am overweight and my dr wants me to lose weight in order to lower my glucose levels overall and I understand that. ",

        "body": "Welcome to our club of T2 users.  After many years of use, we have discovered and learned a great deal, often about what the medical and insurance companies don't disclose. \n\nUnfortunately, insurance coverage often dictates the treatment and care options available to us. However, there are usually workarounds and ways to win.  We just have to ask them, what they require for certain types of treatments, and then get our doctors to support the approval.\n\nI keep this short and say how I am successfully treating mine (test as non-diabetic) after many years of using or trying about every drug and other options, including getting insurance coverage.  I could write a book about what worked and didn't.\n\nI stopped all pills because of their side effects.  They all have them. Some are worse than others.\n\nI switched to insulin because it works, and that is our problem, it's easy availability, costs are affordable, and all insurance covers this treatment.\n\nI use inhaled insulin (Afrezza) as my primary bolus because it's by far the fastest-acting and also out of my system in 1.5 hours. Also, it doesn't cause weight gain like regular insulin. I found that no other insulin treatments can deliver these benefits. \n\nFor stability, I use 10mg of Mounjaro and the basal insulin Awiqli (a weekly single injection).  The benefits are I only need two injections weekly.  Easier to travel and fewer operational problems.\n\nWhen I switched from Lebre and Dexcom's to the Eversense 365 CGM (which lasts for one year and eliminates the weekly CGM problems and operational issues), \n\nAs a result, I simplified and significantly improved my diabetes treatment, and my out-of-pocket costs actually decreased substantially.",

Also you shouldn’t really drink alcohol unless you want your diarrhea to be more painful… you also want to have whole meals like with veggies and protein otherwise sugary carb meals will make ur stomach hurt. Drink lots of water too. You will be okay, but it’s really tough adjusting at first. It’s not forever but if you eat consistently and drink fiber it will help your bowel movements. Never take it on an empty stomach unless you want the worst cramps of your life only take it like right after you’ve eaten.",

    "selftext": "Hey ya'll, just wondered if anyone else has experienced this. I have been on Tresiba for at least 2 or 3 years now (so long I can't even remember). I was initially prescribed 70 or 80 units &amp; went up to 100 to attempt better numbers &amp; have been on that amount forever. I inject at night before bed. I have always taken a shower, injected, got in bed, read for a while, watch tv or whatever &amp; go to sleep. Most of this time I did not wear a CGM &amp; did not test my BG frequently.\n\nI saw a new endo a few weeks ago &amp; started Lispro for the 1st time. My overall sugar is coming down. She never said to reduce the amount of Tresiba. So one night, I inject, and about 15 or 20 minutes later,  my Freestyle Libre 3+ reader alarm starts going off. It said my blood sugar was down to 56! What the what?!!? How? And why? From Tresiba?!!? \n\nBy the time I got downstairs to try &amp; find sugar I was about to pass out &amp; had to yell for my mom to come &amp; help.\n\nThe next night, I injected my Tresiba as usual (just like I had for months &amp; months), but this time, I had my CGM reader sitting right beside me &amp; I watched the numbers tank yet again. Thankfully, they didnt drop quite as far, so I went to sleep, only to be woke up around 4am with the Low Alert &amp; blood sugar showing at 62.\n\nSo I called my endo later that morning &amp; told her what was happening &amp; all she said was that since the rapid acting insulin was bringing my overall sugar down, that 100 units of Tresiba was now too much &amp; to reduce to 80.\n\nSo that night I injected 80 and...guess what? Rapid drop again. It didnt go as low, but I am concerned that I watched it instantly plummet at least 25 to 50 or more points.\n\nNow I am absolutely terrified to inject. I didn't know that Tresiba (ultra-long lasting insulin) could do this?!!? And to have been injecting such a high dose for sooooo many years &amp; not ever had any problems &amp; now this? I even asked my doc if I maybe accidentally injected into a muscle or vein (because I had injected into my leg that 1st night) &amp; she said no, that wasn't a \"thing\" with ultra-long acting insulin.\n\nIs it possible that they'e packaged the wrong insulin into the Tresiba pen?\n\nThat low really shook me up. It felt terrible &amp; has triggered such extreme anxiety that I cant inject the rapid-acting insulin anymore &amp; I have started over with the Tresiba in an attempt to titrate back up &amp; only injected 16 units tonight. This is terrifying 🥺",

I was diagnosed at 38 and spiraled about it mentally for a few months. \n\nIf you’re feeling like you don’t know where to start I would recommend just starting with one thing and building from there. If you’re not active, become more active. Different people have different experiences but for me my activity level makes a massive difference in my blood glucose level, sometimes seemingly more than what I eat. If I ever plan to eat something “bad” I do it before going hiking lol.\n\nIf you’re already active, work on the dietary side of things, starting with the easiest to cut out. Alcohol is good to remove first since it’s pointless calories and can cause problems for diabetics AND for people on metformin. \n\nAnd just be nice to yourself, because it’s a thing you’re going to have to manage long-term.

I think for most people, it’s a shock but in reality, it’s not. I’m obese, I’m eating carbs and ice cream and I don’t exercise. I had a lot happen to me to get to this point so I by no means am beating up on myself or others but it’s a shock in the sense that I was gonna get ahead of this and I didn’t. So you do as much research as possible. I started walking every day and I cut out as much sugar as possible. No carbs, high fiber, high fat, high protein. I think almost all of us do this but what’s important is can you be consistent and continue with that or is it not sustainable and you fall back. That is why I chose NO meds. In a month my blood sugar went from 357 (not fasting) to 150. I think once the shock wares off and you decide what to do you will have more clarity and the depression and anxiety will subside. I’m 2 months in and I am focusing on me. I’m 47 with a 21 year old daughter and it’s always about my husband and daughter. I’m putting myself first. It’s not the end of the world, I promise you.

Generally, most meats are ok! Lots of protein like beef, chicken, seafood, cheese, cruciferous veggies...

        "body": "Hi. This is a going to be long but I will share my story. I went undiagnosed for 12 years and started having vision issues which lead to my diagnosis. My A1C was 12.3 at diagnoses and it’s been 5.5 to 6.7 over the last 10 years. I’m currently 45 years old. \n\nI had tiny blind spots and that blocked out areas of my vision and I had distortion and blurriness. \n\nI started out receiving injections in both my eyes. Eylea was injected directly into my eye to stop the swelling. I also had three laser surgery’s to cauterize the small tears/bulging vessels in my retinas that caused the swelling. This was about 8 years ago and my retinal doctor said I would eventually lose my sight. \n\nHowever, and this is important, You HAVE to keep your sugar under control and A1C in non or pre diabetic levels. \n\nMy left eye became stable after 4 years of laser surgery’s and injections. It is still stable. \n\nMy right eye did not respond to Eylea and I started getting Ozurdex steroid capsules injected in my right eye and I continued with laser surgery’s periodically. The steroid causes cataracts as it slowly clouds and deteriorates your lens. This side effect eventually lead to getting my lenses replaced. The drug can also cause eye pressure to spike and that can cause glaucoma. Pressure needs to be monitored. \n\nAfter 5 years of Ozurdex injections I had leftover capsule shells floating in my retina. Those were all recently removed. \n\n12 years later: \n- Been on Invokana for 11 years \n- My left eye is still stable. \n- My vision is now 20/15 thanks to my cataract surgery. (I do need reading glasses) \n- My right eye is still swelling but it is managed with a topical steroid patch put directly on the back of my eye (no longer getting injections)\n- I’m happy and healthy and no longer afraid of losing my eyesight. \n\nWhat to do. \n- See a retinal specialist immediately. \n- Manage your A1C at all costs. \n- Exercise. \n- Cut out 95% of all refined sugar. \n- Low carb high protein diet.\n- Don’t panic. Be proactive and monitor.",

I spoke with a clinical pharmacist who specializes in diabetes management earlier this year, and she said that aside from the dawn phenomenon some people also get higher and higher BG after a certain point in fasting because they’ve waited too long to eat and their liver starts using glycogen stores. That’s the same mechanism that causes a rise in BG after working out. To me it sounds like that is at play for you, whether because of the exercise or the extended fast - your liver started tapping into stored glycogen.\n\nMy A1Cs have been decreasing regardless of my higher than optimal AM BG. I would say don’t sweat individual data points as much as looking at the bigger picture. ",

As you get fitter the same bike ride might feel less like hard work and the effect may decrease.  At the same time the exercise lowers insulin resistance in muscle tissue and that effect lasts somewhat for 24 and perhaps up to 48 hours.  If your levels come back down relatively quickly after the exercise then it's not something to worry about too much, though do monitor your blood readings after exercise to be sure the insulin dose you're on isn't too much relative to the lowering of insulin resistance.  If levels don't come down quickly then you should definitely discuss with your doctor before changing your insulin dosing, bearing in mind that the situation may change as you get fitter and long bike rides start to feel easier.",

    "selftext": "Just got a CGM and set it up. used to do the pin prick twice a day and I thought I had my food figured out but my tests came back high so I moved to a CGM. and just a few hours later and I'm depressed. I had half a cup of brown rice, steamed broccoli and fish for lunch and it was around 176 and hovered there. Then I had a snack around 4:30 with sardines and multi grain bread and it spiked to 220. I went for an hour walk and it dropped down to 196 but I'm just sitting down and it's rising again!  Is it calibrating? Or is this normal? I'm on 1000 mg of metformin daily. \n\nUPDATE: my CGM is whack! I started calibration after all the advice I got here and whadya know? The CGM showed 176 and finger prick was 124! I knew it was off because I had just woken up and was hungry. I will calibrate better when I have to change this! Thank you all. ",

Being aware of what you’re eating is helping even if a spike happens, I’m learning it can be so many other things aside from my food.  stress, work, other things all cause spikes, and it has truly helped me with how I mange not just my diabetes, but life on life’s terms also!

The basic standards for these devices leave quite a lot of room for discrepancies, and it's difficult to estimate the bias when levels are changing rapidly due to the lag time with CGM readings versus actual blood readings.  Once you know the bias you can put the CGM readings into context and see if they might be on the high side.\n\nIt's worth keeping in mind also that if you're recently diagnosed and can afford to lose weight you may be able to lower your fasting level, your baseline, very significant by losing the excess weight.  If you have weight to lose then you might find you regain more freedom with your diet once the weight loss is done.",

    "selftext": "I deal with diabetic feet all day and would like to share some knowledge about caring for your feet. \n\nDo not soak your feet in hot water. Use warm and test the temp with your wrist. Hot water dries out your skin which can cause cracks in your skin. Possibly leading to infection. Possibly leading to loss of a toe or worse. \n\nCallouses are a huge no for diabetics. Calluses are usually from friction or pressure. You want to avoid calluses which can hide an ulcer under it. They develop to protect your tissues. If you don't keep them under control and the friction or pressure continues, the tissue under the callus is rubbing between the callus and bone. I've worked on what appeared to be an ordinary callus and found an ulcer under it. When you have diabetes, it takes months to heal that ulcer. Months of risking an infection. That means a special dressing, which you will have to change yourself or go to a wound care specialist once or twice a week to change the dressing. Or maybe a wound vac or oxygen therapy. It's not fun. You can't put  weight on it, so plan on wearing a special boot or using a knee scooter for months. \n\nFungus. Athletes foot is very common with diabetics. As soon as you notice it, see your doctor. OTC meds aren't particularly effective for diabetics. That fungus can go to your toenails and that is very, very difficult to get rid of, if you can. Look up diabetic fungal nails. \n\nPut lotion on your feet every day, but not between your toes. Lotion between toes can cause fungus or maceration. Maceration is open skin, que risk of infection. \n\nGo on the internet and do research, look at pictures. ",

        "body": "So hubby recently had surgery that removed a ton of tissue and a couple of tendons (5th metatarsal mid foot, pressure on bottom, vac and main wound was on side not bottom, that has been mostly ignored since bottom stitches came out and tunneling filled). I am not a fan of the wound care NP they’ve given us, but I’ve heard only good things so I’m trying to ignore my personal issues with her. When they first took him off the wound vac, she was like, here, we’re taking it off, come back in 4 days, you can suddenly go to full weight bearing, etc. Of course, there was excessive drainage, macerationq, and hypergranulation and they had to put it back on the next week. A few weeks later, we’re back to removing the vac (this time it’s staying off). But she drops out of the blue today that he can’t ever not wear shoes again, full shoes, not even slippers with cushy feet and hard soles at home, and even to get up to use the bathroom at night he needs to put his surgery boot on and once he’s in shoes, put the real shoes on… the toilet is about 13 clean, clear feet from his side of the bed) Only ever have it off in the shower. Well wait, he’s been weight bearing at least partially for like 5 weeks now and you’re just telling us this today? \n\nSo after being free one week without the vac, and hypergranulation, he’s full weight, I change the dressing every few days for the next 2 weeks, no washing it, I had to practically beg to be able to put something on it to help the moisture (she said betadine on the edges “if you really feel you have to”). The substitute nurse and I had a talk about how awesome MediHoney is, and how great it is preventing hypergranulation (I used it for a wound years ago), and when I asked if it was a possibility for hubby, this NP laughed and was like, “oh that so old school” then talked about getting a skin graft approved (no evidence yet he’ll need one). \n\nSo there’s my rambling, but do you have any thoughts? I’d love to change, but she’s pretty much the only wound care midlevel in the office, and we don’t want to leave this particular podiatrist. I just feel like we’re really not getting top care (and I swear she’s doing the “she’s to the bathroom” just as a dig bc she saw how it kinda shocked and irritated me that she hadn’t said anything, so she doubled down… \n\nAnd if by some chance this is her… talk the other NP into taking us please and stop punishing my husband bc I told you I’d prefer MD and DO to midlevels for major care?",

Im assuming he has neuropathy or vascular disease with as bad as his wound was. Does he have feeling in his feet? He should do everything possible to prevent another injury. Medihoney is in use, yes, but I don't think it would be sufficient in this case. \n\nIf you are truly concerned with his care, then move to another clinic. It's as simple as that.

Everything you said is so important.\n\nIf there is one thing I would say about diabetic foot care it is to check your feet often, every day if possible. Things can go downhill fast and getting problems under control usually requires enormous effort with frequent doctor visits and treatments.\n\nI developed a pressure ulcer under a callus on the ball of my foot. I thought I was keeping the callus in check with gentle use of an emery board and lotion. On the surface everything appeared fine but I started getting pain under the callus. I used insoles that had more cushioning and that helped for a couple months. Suddenly the whole ball of my foot was red and swelling. I set up an appointment with a podiatrist but by the time I got there, 3 days later, the ulcer had broken through the callus and was oozing very nasty stuff. It was infected and spreading.\n\n8 months of wound care treatments followed. There were infection treatments, debridement and other wound therapies, wound dressing offloading, or deflecting pressure away from the wound, shoe adaptations, an orthopedic walker and physio therapy. And lots more I can’t remember.\n\nI now know that if I had gone to the doctor when the pain started I probably could have avoided the worst of it.\n\nSo pay attention to your feet, a little neglect can erupt into major issues.",

    "selftext": "I’ll try to keep this reasonably short (spoiler: I didn’t, sorry). It’s pretty much just a vent, since I’m almost positive things aren’t going to turn out the way the surgeon seems to think they will.\n\nI was diagnosed August 12. A1c was 9.4. The blood test was in preparation for a pair of surgeries we were looking to schedule. Naturally, my diagnosis put the surgeries on hold.\n\nI was not able to see the endocrinologist until August 22. She prescribed metformin and a glucose monitor. Unfortunately, insurance hangups meant I wasn’t able to get any of that until the following Thursday, August 28. \n\nI was given a chart to keep my blood sugar readings, which I’ve done faithfully along with keeping a spreadsheet of what I’ve eaten so I know how to correlate any changes in my numbers. One of the surgeons called me last week and I told him things were going well, I was staying well under 180 which was the number the endocrinologist gave me. He sounded very pleased and told me his scheduler would start working with the other surgeon to find a good date.\n\nYesterday, the scheduler called and gave me a date of October 13 – but I have to get my A1c checked again before they’ll confirm that. They want it under 8.0.\n\nRight away, I’m like, *is that even possible*? I haven’t been monitoring/taking the metformin for an entire month yet, and they expect me to drop that far? So I was disappointed all over again. I know a 9.4 is generally an average of 223, and an 8 is 183. But still, even though I started changing my diet right after I was diagnosed, I have no idea what my numbers were for the next two weeks after that. While I’ve changed my diet in a big way and have lost 20 pounds already, there’s still the two months prior that are going to mess me up.\n\nI just don’t have very high hopes, let’s put it that way. And the most frustrating part is expressing that doubt and having it brushed off.",

I ended up doctor shopping until I found someone I felt was willing to work with me and my goals. She took an aggressive approach that as things normalize we can back off of. I can’t tolerate Metformin, so I’m on 10mg Glipized ER 2 times a day, 2.5 (going up to 5 this coming week) of Mounjaro, and 18 units of Lantus (long acting insulin). They’re already reducing the insulin because I’m getting really low over night and I’ll probably be off it entirely by the end of next month. \n\nI’m eating 35 carbs or less lunch and dinner, 20 or less for breakfast because I take a stimulant ADHD med and that raises my blood sugar when it kicks in and I get 15-20 carbs total for snacks. \n\nI’m eating whole food, tons of fiber, and cooking from scratch as much as possible.\n\nI share all this because the first 2 endos I talked to told me I would never be able to use food to manage and wanted to put me on meal time insulin along with long acting. 3rd doctor said “if you think you can do it, I’ll help you”. She looked at my CGM results on Wed and said I’m crushing it, and if I stick with it I’m going to only need Mounjaro w/in a few months.\n\nFind a doctor that wants to partner with you in your treatment. It’s your body, you get autonomy. Once you find the right doctor, it will all start to work. \n\nGood luck friend, you’ve got this!",

    "selftext": " I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I want to share my story and ask for advice as I prepare for my upcoming GP appointment. I know this is a bit long, but I appreciate you bearing with me.\n\nI recently changed my GP, and since both my parents have diabetes (along with other related health issues), he asked me to do a full set of tests. On August 16th, my results showed an HbA1c of 12.7% and fasting blood glucose of 14 mmol/L, plus vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies. Despite these high numbers, I never really felt diabetic except sometimes feeling very low energy after high carb meals.\n\nMy GP prescribed Metformin over the phone—starting with 500 mg once a day before bed, then increased to twice a day after a follow-up call checking for side effects.\n\nSince the diagnosis, I’ve made significant lifestyle changes based on what I’ve learned from diabetic forums on Reddit:\n\nQuit smoking cold turkey (was smoking 10 cigarettes/day)\nStarted daily workouts — 20 minutes treadmill + 40 minutes strength training\nAdded 20-minute walk after dinner and 5-minute walks after breakfast and lunch\nReduced carbs from ~350g (mostly refined) to 100–120g (complex carbs like ancient grain bread, lentils, beans)\nFollowed recommended diabetic meal portions: half plate veggies, quarter protein, quarter carbs\n\nAfter one month, my latest HbA1c dropped to 9.8%, and my weight decreased slightly from 69 kg to 67 kg (BMI already normal). I also used a Libre Freestyle 2 CGM on a 15-day trial; it estimated my HbA1c at 5.0%, with readings mostly in the normal range.\nI have a GP appointment this Monday — my first since diagnosis — and I want to discuss the possibility of remission. I’m unsure what to ask, such as:\n\nShould I ask for a referral to a diabetes specialist or dietitian?\nHow do I approach asking about remission and the path to it?\nShould I confirm exactly which type of diabetes I have?\nWould it be helpful to show my GP my CGM reports from LibreView?\nAre there any other lifestyle or medication changes I should consider beyond what I’m already doing?\n\nI’m new to managing this and would appreciate any advice on questions to ask, managing diabetes moving forward, or general tips.

        "body": "&gt;Should I confirm exactly which type of diabetes I have?\n\nThat is probably wise but based on your description type 2 appears to be most likely.\n\n&gt;Reduced carbs from \\~350g (mostly refined) to 100–120g (complex carbs like ancient grain bread, lentils, beans) Followed recommended diabetic meal portions: half plate veggies, quarter protein, quarter carbs\n\nThat is not a bad starting point but you can use your meter to fine-tune it. Note that it is carbs per meal which matters, not carbs per day. You are likely to find your carb limits are different for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

You’d probably get better advice if you shared your country.\n\nThat said, here’s how I would handle your questions as a US citizen:\n\n&gt;Should I ask for a referral to a diabetes specialist or dietitian? \n\nYes.\n\n&gt;How do I approach asking about remission and the path to it? \n\nYou can ask, but the truth is that it takes several months of weight loss for it to be in remission, and even then it can always come back. Focus on making the healthy lifestyle changes and it will take care of itself. You can’t really go back to unmonitored carefree eating with a sedentary lifestyle. \n\n&gt;Should I confirm exactly which type of diabetes I have? \n\nYou haven’t already?!?\n\n&gt;Would it be helpful to show my GP my CGM reports from LibreView? \n\nYup. An endocrinologist can subscribe to your CGM reports and gets notified when something goes wrong. Your GP may or may not be with it.\n\nIs your GP a nurse or a real doctor? My experience is that nurses suck at managing diabetes.\n\n&gt;Are there any other lifestyle or medication changes I should consider beyond what I’m already doing?\n\nSounds like you got it, just focus on getting those blood sugar numbers lower. The weight should come off and the symptoms will mostly go away.",

I’m a 28M, I weight 187.4 pounds.\n\nI don’t want to get you bored with a very long post, but I’m just looking for some lighting.\n\nThree months ago my Hb1AC was 6.3. then I started to exercise more, to change my habits. I even lost 38 pounds (17 kilos). The last week I got exams, and I got happy because of the encouraging results.\n\nSome days ago before my exams I got a glucometer, just because I tought it was a good idea (it’s one of those that you need to pinch your finger to get a blood test). But actually it just has made me feel worse, because I see very high numbers, so I don’t know what to think now.\n\nI’m on a keto diet, I’ve had some cheat meals of course, but this last week I’ve been eating healthy and today my glucose even passed 200. Yesterday the highest it went in the whole day was 120, even 2hrs after eating! One day I even tried some tacos and the next morning it wasn’t that bad. It’s something that never ever happened to me before.\n\nToday, before I ate dinner, even with 7 hours of fasting, it was in 191. I don’t have symptoms like going to pee a lot, thirst, blurry vision, nothing like that.\n\nPlease tell me if someone has gone through something similar, I know each body is different and we don’t work the same way, but I’d appreciate any piece of comment. I haven’t gone to a doctor in this period of time because I tought I only needed to change my habits but now I don’t know what to think :(",

One of the reasons is that testing all the time can cause anxiety - which I think might be the case here. \n\nThe other time to test would be if you’re feeling weird and think your blood sugar might be too low. \n\nOther than diet and exercise, think about other ways you can improve insulin sensitivity by reducing inflammation - things like dental health (gums shouldn’t bleed when you brush), get lots of good sleep (maybe check for sleep apnea), focus on your mental health (work stress, relationship stress, health stress all matter) and avoid going to extremes with exercise. It’s a marathon not a sprint! \n\nAnd yeah, it’s a good idea to check in with your doctor to set up a long term plan. Get instructions on how often to test, when you should get your a1c checked, what you need to watch for, that kind of thing.",

    "selftext": "So I went to the doctor in August and my fasting sugar was high at 130. I am a 53 year old male, 6’2 and I was 220.  \n\nThey did not do an a1c at the time. In June I started eating better and eliminated most carbs. I hate to think what my A1C was before then. \n\nI bought a meter and an A1C test. I started testing my bg and I was consistently in the 130 to 160 range that first week. My a1c on the home meter was 8.5 a few days later. \n\nI was pretty devastated because my feet were experiencing neuropathy symptoms. My mom died off this stupid disease so I know how bad it can get. \n\nI cleaned up my diet further. I started running 30 minutes 3 times a week, walking 25,000 steps plus a day, and began lifting weights. I have lost 13 pounds since August 1st. \n\nSo my bg have gone into the normal range, with the exception of mornings and the stupid dawn phenomenon. I have also fine tuned my diet to keep my bg down with a CGM. My bg has averaged 109 on the CGM. My feet symptoms have mostly disappeared. \n\nToday my a1c was 6.1. \n\nI am pretty stoked. I have read these home a1c tests can be as much as .5 off, but at its worst I still have dropped that number a lot. \n\nI just want to share that diet and exercise make a massive difference. The CGM really has helped me dial it in, even though it reads high.  \n\nI have about 20 more pounds to lose to get rid of this visceral fat, but man does that make me hopeful. \n\nThank you guys for your feedback here. It has been invaluable and 1000 times more helpful than the doctor. 😉\n\n",

I’m also overweight and it runs in my family.\n\nThe first appointment I could get with my PCP isn’t until 10/17, so I decided to make matters into my own hands for the time being. I’ve lost 24lbs over the last 6.5 weeks, consume less than 30g of carbs per day, and walk a minimum of 10k steps per day. I feel (felt?) great! \n\nYesterday I had a dizzy spell that lasted several hours so I bought glucose monitor (should’ve weeks ago) and my sugar was 136 after a few hours of eating so not too bad. This morning, though, my fasting number was 183! \n\nPart of me is afraid to know what it was before and the other part is extremely disheartened that it’s still so high. I know fasting is the hardest to lower and I’m going this unmediated right now, but it’s still frustrating! \n\nAgain, just think I needed to vent to folks who understand the struggle.

    "selftext": "I was diag'd back in May.  My A1C had been slowly inching up for the past few years, from 5.3.  At May's checkup, it was 6.9, so full-on Type 2.  Came home and started watching YouTube vids from Berry and Davis (I also have Celiac, and some mild IBS).  Cut the carbs, and basically went to ZERO alcohol, Zero sugar, Zero starches, or as close as I could get.  \nLost 20lbs, have another 40 to go (at least) to get me under 200.  A1C At Home kit showed 6.9 when I first tested with it back in June, so figured that was a good baseline as it agreed with my labwork.  Latest test was 5.3, so good, solid progress there.  \nMorning numbers are high, so guessing part of that is the Predawn crap that others experience.  Just now I was at 140.  I've been doing OMAD fasting.  Checked BG yesterday at 5:30 before eating, and was at 97, lowest I've ever tested, but I've never tested at that time, either.  VA doesn't cover CGMs unless you're on insulin, which I am not, and they only cover 50 test strips every 180 days (I'll be buying my own soon so I can test more frequently).  \nIt can be frustrating to nail things down, given the Celiac and IBS.  I came home yesterday and had a fresh tomato after I tested, and in 15mins had major gut cramps, so off to the bathroom.  From a freakin' TOMATO.    My evening \"treat\" is a bowl of berries with some SIBO yogurt, sweetened with Allulose.  The SIBO is pretty amazing, and can definitely feel an impact from consuming that.  Chips are my downfall, both potato and corn.  I had a handful of chips last night before bed, which I suspect was part of my 140 reading this morning.\n\nReally wanted to say thank you to the community here.  It's such a great resource, and can definitely provide some inspiration.",

The morning spikes you’re seeing are very likely the dawn phenomenon, which many people with T2 experience regardless of how disciplined they are with food. Keeping evening snacks lower in carbs or higher in protein/fiber sometimes helps smooth those numbers. With Celiac and IBS in the mix, your gut reactions make it trickier, but you’re clearly finding strategies that work. Staying consistent, using your own strips to track patterns, and leaning on the progress you’ve already made will go a long way.",

I had a conversation with my primary care and I admitted that I hadn't been taking Trulicity he prescribed me because I was scared of needles and I would've needed to be injecting myself three times a week. My doctor didn't get mad at me, he instead decided to change my injections from Trulicity to mounjaro which made it so I only needed to inject myself once a week and I agreed to it. The process did take a little since they needed to wait for approval from my insurance, then sent prior authorization to my pharmacy and I finally picked up my pens on September 10th and started them first day. \n\nThe first week I started the injection I was very nauseous and for several days I got waves of very bad stomach aches, I would go through one if I ate too much or a big meal and immediately develop very bad aches if i was hungry to the point the pain would wake me up and I couldn't lay down to sleep so I obviously had to have tums and pepto on standby which helped a little, my breath also tasted like rotten eggs which made it uncomfortable. I didn't fully recover until Tuesday and I once again took my second injection today which for some reason did make me bleed a little this time and the injection side did hurt afterwards but honestly i wasn't as nauseous as the first time and I haven't gotten worsening stomach pains. \n\nWhat has been everyone's experience with mounjaro?

My first week was similar to yours, I had zero appetite, felt nauseous, and also had flu symptoms. It got better after two weeks.\n\nNowadays I don’t really have any side effects, outside of the occasional constipation, but getting plenty of fiber and taking a magnesium citrate pill fixed that. I’ve lost 105 lbs since March and my A1C last month was 5.2. I’ve never seen my blood sugar spike over 140 yet with any meal I’ve eaten. My appetite is still very low and I have practically zero issues with sticking to a healthy diet. \n\nI hate to use the phrase miracle drug, but it really has changed my life. I don’t mind taking this drug for the rest of my life if I need to. I recommend sticking with it for at least the full month to see if it gets better. A bit of advice for the injections, make sure you let the shot sit outside of the fridge for an hour or so before you take the injection and you probably won’t even feel it. Taking it straight from the fridge always hurts a little due to the cold liquid.",

I don't know how you weren't feeling lousy with that. \n\nBut, to answer your question, Mounjaro can be a rocky start, but if you give it time, it should work for you with minimal side effects. Works best if you also keep to a low carb diet and eat small portions. The more you don't do that, the more side effects you'll likely have.",

        "body": "Huh?  The recommended dosage frequency for Trulicity is once a week, same as Mounjaro.  Both have a half-life of \\~5 days.\n\nTrulicity and Mounjaro have a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.  Mounjaro also has a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor.   Mounjaro is reportedly more effective at weight loss as a result of the GLP-1 - GIP combination (which appears to be the only distinction).\n\nGiven the peculiar dosage for Trulicity, I'm wondering if the GP followed recommendations of titrating up to the present dosage.\n\nIt's common to start with a minimum dose, but if already taking a GLP-1 drug, base the initial dose on the prior GLP-1 dose.   Then only after the GLP-1 is agreeable for at least 4 weeks, incrementally increase the dose.\n\nAn endocrinologist would be able to work out a regimen that would be effective and agreeable to you and probably avoid the digestive distress you are describing.\n\nOf note, Lilly's autoinjectors (single dose, e.g., US market) have gone from about a 29 G needle to a (thinner) 31 G needle at about the end of 2024, so the injections should become less of a problem.",

Its okay to say no, just dont sound to preachy about your new found life. Shit stops hurting when you have little to no inflammation (sugar/carbs in my world).",

I haven't had fast food in 10 months. I dont miss it anymore And im down 27 lbs.\n- exercise at least 30 minutes per day if possible. Even if its just a walk. \n- do your research. Theres a ton of good info out there that will help you do the things to bring that A1C level down. \n- monitor your blood 2 or 3 times per day in the beginning. It will help you determine what spikes your sugar levels. \n- have a cheat meal once in awhile, just dont go overboard. \n- definitely quit smoking. \nGood luck.",

This is 100% due to the medication as I’m currently too sick to exercise and my diet didn’t change dramatically. My blood sugar is steady as a rock. \n\nI’ve decreased metformin from 850 twice a day to 750 once a day and hopefully in three months it’ll be down to 500 once a day. \n\nI’ve also decreased jardiance from 25mg to 10mg. \n\nI’ve never been on such an effective drug for managing my diabetes, it’s seriously a life saver and a medical miracle. Also, if you don’t want to lose too much weight, you can stay on a low dose just to manage your diabetes, which also makes any side effects far easier to manage. \n\nI personally worked up to 5mg and am planning to stay here. I lost 30lbs and I’ve also been taken off high blood pressure meds, and my pain med intake for my autoimmune disease, autonomic disorders and chronic migraines is half what it was before. For me, side effects are super minimal, just a occasional gassiness and minor constipation. \n\nI don’t feel great yet, but every week is a little better. This is the first time in five years that I’m getting glimmers of a future that might include more than chronic illness, and a lot of that is thanks to this medication. \n\n(Omg ranting and raving and preaching and praising.

I started focusing on my condition and dove into researching diabetes.\n\nOne thing I began noticing (something I’d never paid attention to before) is the convenience store. I live in Canada, and here we have a law that requires cigarettes to be hidden from view behind the counter. The packs also feature prominently displayed graphic health warnings. It’s clear these rules are in place to protect public health, and I’m totally fine with that. I don’t have an issue with it.\n\nBut since being diagnosed, I’ve realized that most items in convenience stores aren’t suitable for diabetics. For example, not long after my diagnosis, I went to the store to grab some milk. As I looked around,  right next to the milk fridge were soft drinks, energy drinks, sugary juices, and beer, with just a small section off to the side for bottled water (almost like an afterthought).\n\nThen I started looking at the products on the shelves, and almost all of them were bad for diabetes. As I walked toward the cashier, I saw the front of the counter packed with candies, rows and rows of them. I couldn’t help but think to myself, “I could kill myself in here. LOL.”",

I mean, the food aisle is where are this food should be—-yet, they also put it AGAIN up by the register to taunt you to buy the “impulsive items”. \n\nThe marketing that these business’ do rely on solid psychological studies that show the human behavior is predictable and easily manipulated. There is a reason most “impulse buy items” are at a certain height—-the height of a small child. A small child will coax their parents to getting whatever is by that cashier. It’s done on purpose. \n\nIf you look around, we are being manipulated from the fact that this so-called-food (it’s actually non-food that is not real food) is plentiful and down to how it is made with three main addictive ingredients: sugar, salt and fat in copious amounts. This is so you will never feel satiated and will increase your dopamine hits so much that they will dull over time and you will need more and more all the time. \n\nIf you think about it, landing on the other side of diabetes can be a blessing in disguise as we are actually becoming aware that things must change. We must eat real food and not to go overboard. We have to live against the grain of how 80% of the rest of the population (that probably has undiagnosed metabolic syndrome too unknowingly) lives yet we have an active advantage to stop the progression. \n\nIt’s sad what has collectively happened to the world. It’s sad that we have to fight against what is being thrown at us at all times to consume.

Are we talking 50% veg (what kind of veg and how is it cooked?), 25% lean protein (how's it cooked?), and 25% carbs? \n\nDo you eat your food \"in order,\" so to say? Starting with vegetables, then protein, then the carbs? A lot of people say it helps blunt the spikes.\n\nWhen your cgm reads low but you feel fine, it's best to do a finger poke test. Sometimes the cgm can give false lows. I've had it happen just sitting on the couch. The first time I saw it was pretty scary, but I felt fine so I was a bit suspicious. Sure enough, it was fine, and the cgm corrected itself shortly after.\n\nI get similar reactions when I do intense exercise. I spike up to 15+ or about 275, and then within 60 minutes, I drop down to 3.2 to 4.2 or about 55 to 75. When this happens, I feel quite unwell from the plummet. My doctor isnt worried, and it seems to be pretty common. Apparently it improves with time.\n\nI also dont generally have much of a sweet tooth but looove salty, savoury snacks like chips. I've found some keto salty snacks to help! Also, I recently tried (very buttery) stove-topped popcorn and so far so good with the cgm. \n\nMy doctor said the luteal phase affects insulin sensitivity, though its much more prominent in diabetics.

    "selftext": "I know this might sound whiny or something to some on here, and I want to apologize in advance for some of that. \n\nI know I’m in OK shape, but I’m really struggling the past couple weeks and wanted some advice or others experiences..\n\nDiagnosed in early March at 7.1. First 3 month check got down to 5.0. Was so pumped. Did low carb, exercised, tested often (5-10x a day). My glucometer average reflected what my A1C was. An average of 98 I think. \n\n\nThrough June, July, August I really switched to testing fasting and maybe 1 other time a day. So probably 6-10 tests a week. My fastings were always 80-100 ish. Some days a bit more than 100, but rarely and that was the highest. \n\nI have tried to somewhat loosen the reigns for sustainability, but have struggled with that mentally. \n\nNow - ever since September, my fasting are always above 100. About 15-25 points higher than they had been. I really am not doing anything different… maybe walking a bit less. But not noticeably so. \n\nI had a 125 this morning and I just kind of broke down. Like this was solid 80s-90s for weeks and now I feel like I’m sliding and lost any semblance of freedom I had - And I am still super low carb. \n\nMy averages are still ok. And I have another blood test this week and expect that A1C to be ok at least although at this point it’s gotta be higher than 5.0. I just don’t want to backslide\n\nSo my question to some in here is … \n\nHave you experienced anything similar? Why are my numbers for 14-15 days considerably higher with the same diet? And is there a chance they’ll go back to where they were? Do I need more drugs? I’m 750 mg metformin once a day rn. \n\nI have a doctors appointment next week and will ask as well.

Diabetes is a marathon and not a sprint though, so the changes that you made and continue to make need to be sustainable for the long term. \n\nThere are so many factors that can affect our sugar levels: lack of or poor quality sleep, stress, illness, exercise, medications. Working about your numbers can have an impact on your numbers.\n\nAs long as your time in range between 3.9mmol (70mg) &amp; 10mmol (180mg) is more than 70% and your A1c is below zero you are gaining the most risk reduction.\n\nIf you are finding it difficult to maintain the changes to reach your targets, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate those targets. Something not quite so tight might make it easier to maintain over the long term.\n\nI would recommend getting a cgm. Abbott (Freestyle) has a program where you can get a trial sensor for free, you can find it on their website. Getting a cgm doesn't mean that you need to keep them for longer than the first sensor of you don't want to but having just one will provide you with some good data that can be much more difficult to capture with finger pokes alone. \n\nI was really skeptical about them and didn't think that I would like having one but it surprised me. I find that I like having it and it makes some things easier. I don't even notice the sensor when it's on. If you decide to keep them you can experiment with different placements, some people get great results with chest or thigh placements, then it is hidden from view.",

Normal sugar levels after for 2 yrs then within 6 months I was diagnosed with prediabetes 3 months after they returned to normal then within weeks became diabetic. \n\nAnyway since then I went from 2 500mg of metformin a day well controlled with A1cs coming back at 44-47. Then all of a sudden I become uncontrolled and had to up my metformin to 2000mg a day. Back to good sugar levels. \n\nDast forward 6 months meds stopped working so we added gliclazide to the mix. 40mg twice a day. Back to being controlled with a hba1c of 41 (non diabetic levels)....over the moon. \n\nTo all of a sudden about 7 weeks ago my sugar levels completely uncontrolled again so I started 80mg of gliclazide twice a day and I am over a month in of taken 2000mg of metformin 80mg twice a day of glic and nothing is working my sugars are higher then ever. \n\nMy question is why am I becoming insulin resistant even more when I haven't changed anything. I try eat as well as possible, I am moving around a lot in the day at work. \n\nSometimes I can get it down to around 9mmoll at night and wake up with them at 13mmoll. \n\nI am less than 5% in range on my dexcom and it's accurate I've been checking against my finger pricker. \n\nThe hospital are currently doing lots of different tests on me to make sure it's T2 I'm pretty sure it is with a family history of T2. \n\nThey are even discussing starting me on insulin. \n\nWhat is Happening!?

        "body": "For me, and I'm not speaking for anyone else who is able to apply this term successfully, I believe it's meaningless. I don't use \"moderation\" in any way when making choices about food. \n\nI was speaking to my nephew who studies linguistics. He kind of went off the rails looking into it and this was what he came up with. Back in the 19th century people were already using the word moderation, but it came from old philosophy and moral advice. Doctors and reformers would tell people to be moderate with things like sugar, alcohol, or rich foods. The diet back then was closer to whole foods. Industrial sugar and refined flour were just starting to take hold, but nothing like the food environment we have now.  \n\nIn the early 20th century industrial food took off. You started seeing canned goods, factory bread, and cheap vegetable oils. Nutrition science was young, so most advice stayed vague. Moderation became the stand in for \"just do not overeat.\" After World War II food manufacturing blew up in scale. Convenience foods, sodas, processed cereals became the base of the Western diet. Instead of saying \"stop eating this stuff,\" both government dietary guidelines and food companies leaned into the same soft idea: enjoy it in moderation.  \n\nBy the 70s and 80s the word moderation was everywhere. You can see it in USDA guidelines, in food industry marketing, in ads for soda or snacks. The brilliance of it is that it prevents any one food from being labeled bad. Coke, chips, burgers, candy all fit the script as long as you said moderation. It takes the spotlight off the way the food itself is made and puts the blame on you if your health suffers. You are the one who failed at being moderate. \n\nSorry to wax philosophical. Again, this works for some, but it didn't work for me.",

Probably not a good idea on an empty stomach.  That would be a lot of carbs very fast and overwhelm your body.  After a salad and steak?  That would be very different.

There isn’t an absolute of how much of X you can have, because it does vary for each person, what else was eaten in the meal, and even your physical condition on the day. \n\nFor me, I find that a full portion size of brown rice is too much and causes me to spike, even when eaten with sufficient fat, protein, and fiber. Depending on what else I’m eating, I might have half a portion now, but I was able to handle even less at diagnosis. Same thing goes for things like steel cut oats or pasta. \n\nIf you’re testing, try testing 60 minutes and then 120 minutes after the first bite. People typically spike around an hour after their first bite (note that this varies from person to person), so testing roughly an hour after you start your meal can give you a general idea of how much a food can affect you. You should be closer to your pre meal fasting at the 2 hour mark. If you’re still noticeably higher than your pre meal fasting, you might want to change something about your meal.",

        "body": "Hey, welcome! Your post reminded me of when I first joined this sub - I had just been diagnosed with a blood glucose of 560 and a bp of 240/140 (or somewhere in that neighborhood) on 18 May 2025. I was scared to even go to sleep because when I was discharged from ER, they were saying things like, \"how are you not in a coma??\" and \"how are you not having a stroke??\" and they couldn't get my bp below 190/120 or so.\n\nWhen I came here seeking answers, people were talking about meds I'd never heard of and A1C, which I knew nothing about. But! Everyone was very kind and I did find one person whose starting blood glucose level had been higher than mine, which made me feel better.\n\nFast forward: I met with a follow up doctor who explained everything to me, set me up with a food plan, a bp monitor, a blood glucose monitoring kit, a slew of meds, then ran a bunch of tests (including my first A1C) before sending me on my way. I was still scared but at least I felt a little empowered.\n\nI've been tested monthly since then and my fasting blood sugar is currently 82 (in the normal range!!), my A1C, which started at 13.6, is now down to 6.7, and my blood pressure is 118/74!! The only thing that's still a struggle and will be for another 6 to 12 months is the nerve damage to my left leg. It's healing but it's a long, zappy journey that's sometimes pretty painful.\n\nYou've found a good place with people who truly know what you're going through. Oh, one more thing to know: everybody's journey looks a little different. As you learn more, you'll figure out how to tweak things for your needs.",

It may persist for a few weeks but it WILL go away. Don’t give up and quit taking it.

My a1c: 10.2, now: not tested yet - better be low 6s!\n\nMy approach: try and walk or exercise after every single meal. Limit each of 3 meals to less than 15g carbs. I tend to be around 10 per meal. Snack are less than 5g maybe once a day. \n\nDidn't do anything except the low carb diet and exercise to lose the weight and it fell off! First 10kg lost in the first 6 weeks. \n\nGo to foods: berries and yopro vanilla yoghurt (it's no sugar but tastier than Greek!) for breakfast. (First couple of weeks it was eggs and bacon but now I can't stomach them!).\nLunch: Caesar salad with chicken and no croutons. Chicken and salad wraps. \nDinner: vege stir fries with chicken (Asian style) or ham, pepperoni, mushroom pizza.\n\nWraps and pizzas use a low carb wrap which is 4.3G per wrap. For the pizza you toast that wrap on a fry pan to get crispy first and then create the pizza and shove in oven. Friggin too good!\n\nEdit: oh I have steaks and vege with mushroom sauce too!\n\nI also take 1g of metformin morning and night. \n\nHonestly I feel healthier than I have ever (I'm 49 btw).

        "body": "Your A1C of 6.5 was just at the cutoff, so it was caught early.  Like others have said, you should test your blood sugar after meals to get a feel for what affects you.  Foods affect everyone differently.  You will need some carbohydrates, mainly in the form of fiber.  You want to stay away from refined carbs(bread, cake) and starchy vegetables.  This is where the testing comes in.  It’s almost like an allergy elimination diet.  Eliminate as much as you can initially and add things back, and test.  You might find that you can eat some potatoes with a meal, or maybe not.  You might find that sourdough bread is ok for you, maybe not.  It’s overwhelming at first, but you will get the hang of it.  Also exercise like others have said.  Your skeletal muscles can uptake glucose without needing insulin to open the door.  Walking after meals helps to flatten or eliminate a spike.  Just be aware that exercise can also cause a rise in blood sugar, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while.  I wear a stelo CGM, which is available OTC in the US.  It’s $90 for a month supply(2 sensors).  I initially was only going to wear one for a month or 2, but I like the data it provides so will wear one indefinitely.  With such a low A1C, im not surprised you weren’t given any instructions or testing supplies.  The metformin alone may get your A1C down, but testing gives you real time info.",

Here is my path to success \n\n1) don’t try to quit everything at once. If you try to quit everything at once it will be more difficult. The first thing I did was quit drinking pop and sugary drinks.\n\n2) start watching your carb intake. I have a protein shake for breakfast and a keto wrap with ham, turkey, cheese and lettuce with string cheese for lunch everyday. Total of about 20 carbs. I try to limit my dinner carbs to 30 to 40. Make sure to eat a lot of protein and fiber with dinner. It will help with the sugar spike. \n\n3) most important for me, WALK, WALK, WALK!! I go on a two mile walk after lunch and dinner everyday I can. At bare minimum go for a brisk 15 minute walk after meals. I have had some bigger carbs meals and my blood sugar spikes very little because of my walking. \n\n4) you can still enjoy your life. Have a treat every once in a while. Just make sure to walk after!!\n\nRemember that people with well managed diabetes live longer than people without diabetes. That alone gave me a ton of hope. \n\nPeople on here as super helpful with stories and advice. It has helped me a ton\n\nAs long as you are ready to change, you will.

Suddenly, I had a bigger problem than smoking. Yes, smoking is bad, but this was worse.\n\nMy doctor prescribed Metformin 500 mg: one pill in the morning and one after dinner to get me started and see how things would progress.\n\nI used to be really active, playing sports regularly. But I had stopped almost everything without changing my lifestyle. I was still drinking sugary drinks, energy drinks, eating sweet snacks, and barely moving. No exercise, no balance. On top of that, I have a family history of Type 2 diabetes on my mother’s side.\n\nAfter three months of making changes, my A1C dropped to 7. Now, it’s around 6 and still taking Metformin 500mg.\n\nHere are a few examples of what I did and still do:\n\n• \tI drink water instead of sugary drinks or energy drinks.\n\n• \tI eat raspberries or blueberries instead of sweet treats.\n\n• \tI walk every day, about 60 to 90 minutes.\n\n• \tI get 7 hours of sleep each night.\n\nDiabetes doesn’t go away, but it can be managed. That’s something I’ve learned firsthand. Since joining Reddit, I’ve seen how many people are actively taking control of their health. It’s inspiring to see the different paths people take to live well with this condition.\n\nThanks for reading. If anyone has tips or wants to share their own journey, I’d love to hear it.",

I spend my time looking for low carbs and no sugar (or very little) but I am afraid that I am not recognizing if I may be missing “good “ carbs. It would be awesome if labels just said something like: Carbs 20g (15 good and 5 bad). Is there a rule of thumb I should use?

That is important because in the USA fibre (aka fiber) is lumped in with carbs in the nutrition count while in most other countries it is listed separately.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIn any case the best method is to use nutrition labels as just a guide when selecting foods the first time but your meter as the judge to determine whether to include that food next time and the appropriate portion size if you do.

        "body": "In the US fiber (with an 'er') is listed as a carb, and 'net carbs' is total carbs minus fiber.  Fiber is not readily converted to glucose and absorbed into the blood, so it's the net carbs number that matters most.\n\nOutside the US fibre (with an 're') is listed separately from readily absorbable carbs, so the 'total carbohydrates' figure on a European food label for example is equivalent to 'net carbs' in the US context.\n\n'Good carbs' for a Type 2 are ones which are digested slowly, as that gives the pancreas more time to release the necessary insulin to handle the carbs entering the bloodstream from the intestine.  Generally speaking the best carbs come from whole foods like whole grains, veg and nuts - foods where the carbs are locked up with other nutrients which delay the digestion of the carbs - fibre, fat and protein.  The best available indication of this is the 'glycemic index' (GI) of a food.  You can find information about the GI of various foods online.\n\nIn reality though it's as much about quantity as it is about how 'good' the carbs are.  A large amount of 'good' carbs in a meal will cause a bigger spike than a small amount of sugar.  For me personally a meal with a lot of brown rice is worse than a moderate portion of ice cream.  There's much more starch in a pile of rice than there is sugar in a couple of scoops of creamy ice cream, and the fat in the ice cream helps to delay digestion, stimulate incretin hormones and so suppress the spike.\n\nThe complexity of all this is why testing your blood before and two hours after a meal is useful.  It provides real world information about how well your body handled the carbs in a specific meal.  This allows you to learn over time which meals and portions are 'good' and which are too much for your body to handle well, in which case you might need to tweak the portions of carbs in the meal.",

I’m scared of the process/roller coaster starting all over again. \n\nWas the Covid the only thing that changed about my life back in 2023 that could have affected my diabetes? Definitely not. Do I want to risk this happening again without preparing? Oh he** no. I’m asking my doctor about what to do or if she’s seen this before, but I thought I’d ask here as well. \n\n\nThanks! ",

Infections like Covid can temporarily raise blood sugar because your body releases stress hormones that make you more resistant to insulin. That’s why many people with diabetes notice higher readings during illness, even if their meds were working well before.\n\nThe good news is that these spikes are usually temporary and often settle once your body recovers, especially since you’ve had such a strong response to Mounjaro. Preparing ahead (hydration, close glucose monitoring, staying in touch with your doctor, and having a “sick day plan” for diabetes management) can really help lessen the roller coaster. It’s great that you’re already planning to discuss this with your doctor, they can adjust things if needed while you’re sick.",

It is your liver trying to be helpful by releasing its stores of glucose when it senses that you need it because you're now doing things that require energy but because you were fasting you don't have any glucose in your system to use. The liver glucose storage is what Metformin controls.  \n\nSo the trick is to use up that glucose store as well before going to bed as fasting won't touch it, you need some exercise to force your body to use it.  Drugs like more Metformin,  or GLP-1 can help as well. Long Lasting insulin doesn't really help with this.",

In combination with other hormones it may be partly responsible for Dawn Phenomenon, though that's just a guess as nobody knows for certain what causes it.\n\nMany people report that their blood glucose levels a few hours after breakfast are lower than their levels before breakfast.  I've read one report from a person who eats a few walnuts with their morning coffee and uses double cream in their coffee, and he claimed that this is enough to end Dawn Phenomenon for him and bring his levels back down.  I've read another report from a person who prepares small snacks of meat and cheese, puts them beside the bed, and eats one immediately after waking up.  They too claim that this does the trick.\n\nIf these reports are true then that fits with asprosin being part of the cause of Dawn Phenomenon, and the solution might be to get out of the 'fasted state' when you wake up.  Eating a low-carb breakfast might do the trick but as nobody actually knows for certain what causes Dawn Phenomenon (very probably hormones, but unproven) then you might need to experiment to see what works for you.  I note that both of these solutions I read about involve fatty foods (cream, nuts, cheese, meat) but I have no idea if there's some magic there, or if perhaps a few morsels of any type of food might do the trick.",

Abbot will replace their Freestyle Libre 2 and 3 sensors (which don't support calibration) if they are more than 15 to 20% away from three finger stick readings (accounting for the delay between blood and CGM, which Abbott say is 5 to 10 minutes in the email they send you if you try to get a replacement).  I don't know what the replacement policy for the Stelo is.\n\nIf you want to compare CGM with finger stick test when blood glucose levels are stable, such as before meals. It's hard to compare them when levels are changing rapidly. Bear in mind also that some finger stick meter models read low, and some high, on average.  Some meters give readings which jump all over the place from one test to the next.  While all finger stick meters are supposed to conform to the same basic standards some models are vastly better than others.  The best meter available is a Contour Next One, which reads very close to objective accuracy on average with minimal variation from one test to the next.\n\nWith a good meter it is possible to put biased (always high or always low) CGM readings into context, to figure out how much to add or deduct from CGM readings to get close to accuracy.  You mention a 30 to 60 point variation - when blood glucose levels are stable the range of variation between CGM and finger stick should be much more narrow than that.  If you're getting that wide a variation you either have a faulty CGM or a bad finger stick meter which gives readings that jump all over the place.",

However I am VERY careful about sugar obviously and eat pretty well/healthy. Do I cheat every now and then yes I do. When I was first diagnosed I was Obese! And that definitely turned my life around. I remember as I was changing my diet getting my fat ass to the gym it was the Super Bowl and I was saying to my doctor it’s going to suck because I can’t eat any wings and I love wings. Her response “You can have a few of them but you need to make sure you do physical activity that day before you do. It’s a reward and you’re allowed a reward. The other thing she told me is I could eat what I wanted within reason but I MUST do physical activity every day. Now fast forward I dropped 37lbs and I’m still on 2000mg of Metformin because I can’t get my A1C under control. Now mind you I’m 54 I wasn’t getting enough sleep and probably drink a tad too much. But it has gone down and I think when my next blood test which I think is in about 2 months it should go down even further. But all my other numbers were good! BP, BS, Cholesterol (could be a little lower) and I feel great! But I’m monitored by my doctor every few months and I’m on the right path. This works for me and not for everyone. But the key for us is to make sure we are physical and we need to “watch” what we are eating g and eat right. Does that mean the 1 McDonald’s Burger and Fries I had Friday Night is going to kill\nMe. No! Was I physical Friday and Saturday YES. But the results will be in a couple of months. Also she did tell me that sleep has a lot to do with getting BS and A1C down as well.",

When I changed the sensor the original sensor was reading 160ish. 30 minutes later new sensor read 110. I suppose it’s possible I dropped that fast, but highly unlikely. Additionally the new sensor has not had me at above 155. The first sensor never had me below 150.\n\nNow the new sensor is triggering as critically low and after it does it displays an error. This happened once last night and now twice tonight. Because it said I was at 55 I ate some Lifesavers. Then I realized I didn’t feel low and quickly took a reading with the new manual meter I bought. Manual meter says 119, G7 says 55. I recalibrated and now the G7 says 114. \n\nI think I’ve been prescribed too much long acting insulin because I keep going very low. The doctor is basing their dosing on the numbers they’re seeing from the CGM despite it being very inaccurate. \n\nI’m calling Dexcom tomorrow and if you’ve had problems with the G7 I hope you’ll call them too. \n\nI work in tech and have some name recognition in my discipline. I’m hoping to leverage that to force them the fix their quality issues. Since my insurance company won’t cover the Freestyle despite it being a significantly better CGM I figure my only option is to force them into fixing their product. The inaccurate readings are likely a hardware issue, the sensor failures after a low are most likely a software issue. No matter the root cause, I consider this to be a dangerous product I’m angry I wasn’t warned by my doctor that it can’t be trusted.\n\n",

I'm simply briefly sharing my journey so far. \n\n\nI was diagnosed at 12.4 a1c... Fasting was 20 mmol. I took no meds.. my doctor was not happy. 🥴\nMy 3 months is coming up end of September. So a few weeks. \nMy fasting numbers are anywhere from 4.5-5.4 mmol.. was like this from 1 week in when I got my meter. \n\nThe only thing I've changed in my diet is from that day I've had no juice, pop or sugary drinks. I don't stack my meals. I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't really snack at all. \nAnd when I tell you guys I was an INSANE abuser of juice and sugary drinks. For context I would drink 2 L bottle of juice in a few hours and that wouldn't take into account if I ate something else that came with a drink. I would mix different juices and pop together. When I was diagnosed it was no surprise I simply just said well I did this to myself. Drinking water was a foreign concept to me. \n\nAlso I had constant urination at the start of the month I was diagnosed. I found out on a Thursday and the urination went away 2 days later. So by Sunday I noticed I didn't get up at night to pee 3 times minimum. Also my eyes went blurry after diagnosis and that lasted two weeks. Everything has been back to normal now. I did a diabetic eye test and everything came back clean. \n\n\n I obsessively tested with finger pricks. At first i would be doing 60min, 90min, 2hr and 2.5 hr so I could understand the curve of the meals I ate. I've charted everything with chatgpt to share with my endocrinologist follow up in a few weeks. With all of that being said I've tested some VERY risky foods for diabetics and I rarely see a spike to/above 8.0 mmol within the 60-90 min mark. And within 2-2.5hrs I'm back to mid 5.5 mmol or lower. Sometimes 4s. All my meals have carbs except breakfast when I usually sometimes have a protein shake or maybe just start my day with lunch. I've charted 120 grams of carbs in a meal before. \n\n As OP mentioned the only time I saw a fasting in the 6 was when I had the cold/flu. Was about 2 days then back to down. \n\nI should also mention I lost about 30 lbs in less than 10 weeks. I did no exercise. No post meal walks or anything. My body has always been very responsive to dieting changes and I also gain muscle very fast when I do work out in the gym. I do plan on getting back in the gym after my 3 months update. I was at 230 ish and now I'm at 195 as of today. I'm 5'11. \n\nI do know my A1C is now atleast at 7.1 mmol.\n I tested at shoppers drug Mart 6/7 weeks in my journey. So we will see where I'm at end of this  month. \n\nMy energy and feel for life has changed so much I am honestly thankful for this diagnosis I feel like I've saved my own life and changed the direction I was going in which was most likely an early grave. Most people see this diagnosis as the end of life.. for me it was the start of mine. \nI will never return to that version who was slowly killing himself. \n\nI'm also still very new and not sure what all of this means.",

Once that was better, my glucose response is pretty normal as long as I don’t go overboard either in number of carbs or elevated carbs for too long.  I’m still fine tuning…. \n\nLook… it’s a living system and what “normies” eat carb-wise is higher than humans should be consuming. Breaking the system makes it more sensitive to the abuse of carb load and everyone is different in what they can process. \n\nI suspect that given enough time of normal bg combined with intermittent fasting and most of time being in nutritional ketosis allows the body to heal enough to be able to process more carbs normally… but not a big amount for long periods (that would easily kick you back into insulin resistance). I intend to test this theory thoroughly over time :)",

Do I think if I eat like I used to I’d see no spikes and everything is back to normal as it was when I was younger? No. I know if I push it I’m going back, but I still call it reversed since my numbers moved back to non-diabetic range.

Most people who do have those issues when taking MJ are also taking other diabetes meds. I have been T2D for over 30 years and have been taking MJ for a little over 2 years. My HbA1c just before I started taking it was 8.6 and three months later, it was 6.1. More recently, it has been 5.1/5.2. GLP1 meds do often cause some GI issues, but I have found them manageable.

I do all the things I should. I occasionally have some sugar like maybe half and half sweet tea something like that but I try to be good most of the time. So in the last two weeks I feel like I have developed a thyroid problem because I have been losing my hair, my skin is really changing, I have lost about 20 lb and I have three loose teeth. So I went to the endocrinologist yesterday. They did not run any tests but they did a full analysis of me and said I think you may be type one and a half and insulin resistant so in the meantime until we can get all these tests ran on you we want you to try this Afrezza inhaler because I have noted in my chart that I am scared of needles. I cannot inject myself nor prick my finger. Just wondering if anyone has tried this, are there any side effects, and does it work or should I just bite the bullet and get someone to help me and start using a pump until I get all this figured out? I daily take Jardiance Metformin and Atorvistatin...",

It explained a ton, I was constantly thirsty (I mean parched, waking up with cottonmouth), frequent peeing, itchy as all heck everywhere, fungal infections all over, severe patches of nigricans all over, disgusting toenails, horrible sleep and just generally constantly tired. Obvious ones are urinal tract infections and commonly infected pimples and bloods. They’re all common to diabetics.\n\nBut it all happened gradually so it just became normalised and I’d never really put two and two together. I probably subconsciously knew to because I’d constantly duck my yearly checkup and bloods, get scripts from relatives for medication instead of going to the doc, etc. to avoid getting the verdict.\n\nSeeing the specialists at the hospital, the endocrinologist, the dietitian and the diabetic nurse was just a revelation. Really specific plans and facts based on me and my lifestyle and culture.",

Understand it, decide how you're going to tackle it and apply yourself. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed, I set myself two simple aims based on what I had read about controlling T2. Manage my carbs day to day to control my current blood sugar and lose weight/body fat over time to give my pancreas a chance to recover. I've lost 10kg and it seems to have been enough to allow my pancreas to produce enough insulin to mean I can have a more normal diet, albeit weary of carbs and avoiding straight sugar. \n\nI know I haven't won, I'll always need to keep things in check, but the strategy worked to give me more freedom of choice.",

Know couple of folks that have gone on to get their newest 1 year sensor model.  It has not yet been released in the country I live, but will definitely try it when it does come here probably within the next 9-12 months.\n\nThe insertion is really very minor.  Just few millimeters long and not even stitches are required for it to close up after insertion.\n\nThe principle and insertion place is similar to what many women have been using for years also for long-term birth control (1 to 3 years!), which is a small \"stick\" like the Nexplanon.  That is a small, flexible rod that is inserted in under the skin of the upper arm by a healthcare professional.  That implant steadily releases a hormone that prevents pregnancy for up to three years.\n\nThe Eversense was super accurate after the initial period of daily calibrations vs fingerprick.  And these days its just 1 per week.  It is not really going off the rails anyway, but that is the routine you need to comply with.  I expect as more long-term trial data gets in, that this will be further lax going forward (fewer to no requirements for calibrations after initial run-in).  As the sensor tech is not really degrading over time as it is with the bio-chemical enzyme the existing short-term BG sensors like Dexcom and Libre relies on today.\n\nPressure lows during sleep are also not an issue with Eversense.",

But please don’t put it off like I did. My greatest regret in life is that I didn’t listen to my parents to lose weight or I’d get diabetes.  I’ve had it know for about 25 years but really started doing something 15 years ago. Walk, walk, and walk some more, 90 minutes after eating, just 10 or 20 minutes will help your sugar not to spike. Eat greens, veggies first before your protein and carb. \nI actually put fresh frozen kale in my protein shake every morning. If I go out I have greens (which I do not like but eat anyway) before my eggs and one piece of toast. It makes a difference. I was on insulin and worked my butt off to stop it, which I did, got off all my meds. Recently I was put on mounjaro to lower my A1C which it hadn’t done. I used no drugs, they weren’t on the market back then, to lose 80 pounds. And the mounjaro does nothing for me so coming off that. I also, for 3 months only, am trying the metformin ER. This is helping with controlling my sugars. I do take supplements for diabetes: Berberine and Alpha Lipoic Sustain. I have a wonderful D.O. who I go to who figures out what to take. I also have a nephrologist, a regular doctor, who doesn’t like to give out prescriptions unless you have tried all other options. Hope this helps and encourages you to be your own advocate.

No eating after 7pm too.\n\nI eat to the meter so if a food I eat spikes me it comes off the list.  I really bought into the concept of resting my pancreas as much as possible so I try my hardest to keep myself under 100 as long as I can through out the day. I still have weird days where I’m slightly elevated and some days where it seems I can eat anything without any eye opening spike. These days seem to show up when I’m about to lose a few pounds, but it’s probably just a coincidence.  \n\nThe good news is that my insulin sensitivity has seemingly improved and I’ve upped my carbs to 75 or more on some days. I still do restricted eating here and there and seem to be coasting now. While my dawn phenomenon has gotten better I’m still in the battle to crush it. It’s really frustrating, but it’s not that bad number-wise so I’m not overly concerned about it day by day.",

Carbs maybe trigger the GIP hormone more than GLP-1. Ozempic works all the time so it's likely that it works to suppress appetite by 'boosting' the effect of the natural hormones released 30 minutes plus after eating, doubling up on the natural GLP-1 hormone in a sense, after food starts to exit the stomach.  That may be how it's most effective at suppressing appetite after meals.  If you want to maximize the effect maybe start a meal with an appetizer that has a lot of fat and protein, salami or pepperoni or maybe cheese come to mind, with a pause before the main part of the meal.  With those kinds of foods hitting the intestine, exiting the stomach, before you start eating carbs you may find your appetite is suppressed sooner.  Or maybe eat very slowly to get the maximum hunger suppression from whatever you're eating.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m hoping to hear from people with type 2 who were put on insulin at diagnosis. Were you able to come off it? If so, how long did you need insulin, and what were your circumstances when you were first diagnosed (A1c, ketones, weight, other meds, etc.)? And how was the decision made to come off insulin with your team?\n\nA bit about me:\n\n* I’m 34F, very lean and active (BMI \\~18), strong family history of type 2.\n* Diagnosed about 5 weeks ago after routine bloods showed very high HbA1c (13%).\n* No symptoms at diagnosis.\n* I also had glucose + ketones in urine and very high blood ketones, so I was hospitalised and started on insulin (but hadn't yet gone into DKA, blood ketone was at 3mmol).\n* All antibodies for type 1/ LADA came back negative.\n* Current insulin needs: 5units Lantus at night (this usually keeps me steady at around 7mmol (126 mg/dL) at night and fasting), and I seem to be very insulin resistant with carbs (ratio varies between 1:3, and 1:7 depending on time of day, type of carb, level of activity etc).\n* I've been put on ER Metformin as of 2 weeks ago. Started with 500mg then increased last week to another at dinner, so at 1000mg. Currently experiencing some side effects (constipation), so waiting until this eases before upping my dose.\n* I haven't noticed much difference in insulin needs as of yet. Maybe slightly less but I think it's too early to tell and not very significant. Though I was initially on 10 units of Lantus the first week, but this was lowering my a1c too quickly (night time was down to 5mmol with this) so switched to 5 units.\n* I'm currently eating a low carb, high fiber diet (not keto), approx 10g - 20g of carbs per meal, very minimal snacking. Diet is focused on: chicken, oily fish, lots of non-starchy veg, chia seed, flaxseed, raspberries, other fruits and nuts, minimal dairy. Trying to increase the frequency of activity through the day and from next week will work on trying to increase muscle mass.\n\nMy Diabetic nurse said she's hopeful that I can one day come off insulin if the Metformin looks like it's making a difference. Looking forward to the prospect of not needing to be on insulin - but worried this is a false hope!\n\nThanks!",

Some people with type 2 are able to come off insulin once things stabilize, especially if metformin, diet, and activity are working. How long that takes varies, sometimes weeks to months , and it depends on how much natural insulin your pancreas can still make.\n\nSince you’re lean and active, your case is a bit unusual, so your team will watch you closely to be sure it’s truly type 2 and not another form. Your nurse is right to be hopeful: coming off insulin is possible, but not guaranteed. For now, think of insulin as a tool to protect you, not a life sentence.",

This is my next frontier as I sit at a desk 55 hours a week",

I recommend this for anyone who’s struggling with stomach issues especially from metformin. I wish I had figured this out earlier!!!

It's getting worse by the hour. Red. Hot. Huge. Painful.  I was prescribed antibiotics and I have to take it 4 times daily in case this is a skin infection (cellulitis). If not better in 3 days,  I am to return to the ER because this could likely be a diabetes complication. Tbh with how it's progressing I'm scared I'll be back sooner than the 3 days. \n\n\nIt's so frustrating because even my labs today showed my glucose improvement. My a1c went from 9.2 to 6.1 in 2 months. Im down 30 pounds. My blood pressure is great! I am finally eating decent.  Everything else is getting better and yet... I'm just worse. \n\nCan I just say it? Fuck Diabetes. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\nI'm new to all this mess and I feel like I can't get a grip on any of it. I am FRUSTRATED. A little background information- I had a pituitary macroadenoma removal in 2021 leaving my pituitary completely useless and me on steroid replacement for the rest of my life. This has led me to steroid induced type 2 diabetes. On that note, I have an endocrinologist that I see regularly every 3 months for monitoring of all my, what seems like, million of ailments. She is WONDERFUL, except when it comes to this. I'm having a horrible time managing my numbers down. I am currently on 2 Kwik pens- tresiba 10u for long acting and novolog 6u before meals for fast acting and a sliding scale as follows for corrective action if I can't get my numbers down after meals: \n151 -200 1u\n201 -250 2u\n251 - 300 3u\n301 -350 4u\n351 -400 5u\nOver 400 6u\n\nI've been doing this sliding scale and I feel like it does NOTHING. When I wake up my fasting glucose will be around 130-150. I'll do the corrective 1u, it does nothing. So I'll go ahead and eat, I don't eat breakfast so I do lunch and try really hard to stick to things like rotisserie chicken with green beans or cottage cheese, etc. and I'm still hitting numbers over 200 after meals. So I'll do the corrective action on the sliding scale after I get dinged by my dexcom and 2 hours later, I'm still in the 200s. Do it again. Same thing. It will be like this ALL. DAY. LONG.i feel like I'm just constantly chasing my tail. Then it's time for dinner and my numbers will finally be around 120s and it's the same game over again. I don't know what to do. Do I just play around with my units until I find what's right for me despite what my endocrinologist is suggesting? I just feel like I'm not being heard. She keeps saying \"you need to make sure you're not having lows\" but that's not my problem. I'm feeling like garbage because I'm running high. I'm never the \"normal\" 70-100 like you're supposed to be. What am I doing wrong?",

        "body": "You’re not doing anything wrong, the problem is that using only a sliding scale often means you’re always “chasing” high sugars instead of preventing them. That’s why it feels like nothing is working.\n\nUsually, blood sugars are better controlled when:\n\n* Your **basal insulin (Tresiba)** is set at the right dose to keep your fasting numbers steady. If you’re waking up in the 130–150s, it might need a small adjustment.\n* Your **mealtime insulin (Novolog)** is matched to the carbs you eat, instead of always taking the same 6 units. This is called carb counting, and it usually works much better.\n* The **sliding scale** can still be used, but it works best as a backup, not the main way you dose.\n\nThe best step is to take your Dexcom readings and food logs to your endocrinologist so they can help adjust your doses. Once your insulin matches your meals better, you should spend less time running high all day.",

Just start exercising and get in control. \n\n\nWhat matters more; maintaining muscle mass and letting your disease progress unchecked, or losing weight and giving yourself years of better health to reevaluate how important your physique is? Stop researching and start doing. Eat less/better and excercise. Eventually, eat healthier for 95% of meals and try training instead of just exercise. \n\nJust start now-- literally go for a walk and don't eat a second helping. Do some bodyweight squats. Start",

What I found was that some breads were fine (even white bread) while others were nuclear (bagels, croissants). Potatoes spiked me a little but mashing them and adding cheese made them less spikey. Rice is terrible for me in any form. Weirdly, Peanut M&amp;M's have almost no effect, nor do Oreo's. I tried listening to the recommendations of other people but honestly, I think we're all so different and this stupid disease is so poorly understood, that I think you have to become your own science lab and experiment on yourself and see how you react to things. I've got solid control on my T2 now after 2 years because I'm very careful about what I eat. And not for nothing, as much as I thought I'd do well on Keto, it makes me insane after just a few days.

So trying to change my process on fruits,veggies, grains, and legumes is hard because I’m still stuck in that keto  mind frame of “this is bad for me because of the carbs” \n\nThank you for your comment! It was very much needed. 💙😊",

Life is continuous learning what foods and combinations are working for me.  Been trying my best to stay under 1350 cals/day and trying to follow a 40/30/30 (c/f/p).  I also adjusted my Time in Range down to 3.9 to 8.0. Am curious if the Libre App estimate is close to the next A1C test. \n",

I've had food poisoning so many times in the past at \" all u can eat\" Chinese restaurants.\n\nYou're right about the eggs, scrambled or boiled.  I eat them on keto just because they can help with weight loss.  They're also an  ideal keto food. Keto reversed my type 2.\n\nI am keto now, but I've been sick since starting keto, and I usually crunch on celery with sea salt or sip on natural animal broth for the extra salt. I also find that cauliflower rice ( no carbs)and  heated in chicken broth help. If you try it, you can also add sliced pieces of already made store bought rotisserie chicken. It really helps kill the virus. It really does the trick. No blood sugar spikes. On keto, the only fruit allowed are berries  ( blue, black,  strawberry,  raspberries) due to extremely low sugar content. Again, there are no spikes.  Warm lemon tea with no sugar substitutes works, too. Good luck, and I hope you get better soon.",

Some nights it was pretty miserable. \n\nSome shoes made my feet feel more numb. \n\nMy sugar has been very controlled by diet and exercise the last 4 months, particularly this month as I have lost weight. \n\nI have noticed this month my feet feel mostly normal. Other than a slight stiffness around the toes they feel okay. \n\nI don’t have the tingles, numbness (except for a slight lack of sensation on one side of my right second toe) and they never burn anymore. \n\nThey can be touched and it not make me jump out of my skin. My feet are also not as dry and flaky. The skin is smooth. I can wear less comfortable shoes without issue now. \n\nMy question is, has anyone else experienced this and will it last as long as I keep my glucose tightly controlled?\n\nThe doctor said it was permanent and we needed to keep it from getting worse. \n\nMy bg is basically normal now. I rarely have a reading over 120 and it never lasts very long when it does. \n\nIf I maintain this will I keep healing or are there limits? I would say it is 90% better. ",

Went on 160mg Gliclazide am and pm, which was leaving me feeling really sick all the time, and then only recently moved to a long acting insulin.

Also try eating your veggies before anything else, yes it’s a pain but it works. Then eat your protein and then the carb. I read the Glucose Goddess books, written for non-diabetics  because it’s damaging for your body’s sugar to spike, diabetic or not. I tried all her advice and it has helped me tons. It’s also helps to walk for 10 minutes, 90 minutes after you have eaten. All the doctors I have been to, other than my DO, do not care about anything other than lining their pockets.  I really wish you the best.",

There’s a strong correlation according to what I read between adverse and traumatic childhood experiences and Cushings.\n\nI also noticed after eating a really spicy dinner the other day I got my blood sugar to dip by 50 points (from 250 to 195ish), so I’m eating a lot of spicy food, which is fine, I like spicy food.

When asked why the insulin so early in my pregnancy, I was told not to complain since I had been taken insulin prior to that, which I did not. When I tried to tried to explore other alternatives like lifestyle changes, the doctors, insurance refused and connected to a pediatric nutritionist. Let’s just say that and my second pregnancies were a nightmare on so many levels. I did took the recommended insulin but did experience some hypoglycemic episodes.\n\nSince 2021, I have not been taking any insulin and been trying to avoid my doctor given the traumatic experiences I had in this area. I happen to take a fasting test and my A1c is 11.1%. I have lost about 7lbs in the past three weeks by reducing my food portions with a healthy mixture of protein, healthy carbs, and eliminating processed food. I have also started to do strength training workouts 3-4 times per week including more walks.\n\nMy question to the community: is it possible to reduce my A1c by continuing to lose weight and working out? I don’t have a history of diabetics in my family, so I would like to explore various options before committing to insulin once again. TIA! ",

I am a 26F and in within 3 months along with diet, walking and metformin and some other tablets reduced my A1C to 7%. Since I have PCOS and other issues I am taking Mounjaro under my doctor's advise. I have been eating the same as I usually do but I am still consistently loosing weight and my levels are normal. Due to my past habits my body thought the required intake is just 800-1000kcal and rest was over so kept storing almost everything on top in fat. My body was running on survival mode. GLP helps in resetting that. I have taken just 2 shots and I am down about 6-7 pounds already. \n\n  \nMeanwhile the workouts and good diet are definitely the key. As per my GP, if I can loose even 15% weight as per my highest weight and maintain it, I will be in remission. Definitely doing the right thing! Insulin is just the momentary fix and not the cure. The lifestyle changes and reducing insulin resistance is the core of remission. You are absolutely right to deny the insulin. Good Luck!",

When I started I was 236 but only 5’4”. I also was put on insulin. I started researching the effects insulin has on my body, not good. I went to a nutritionist and started to lose the weight. I thought that just by losing weight my sugar would automatically go down. I was wrong, I had to start walking. I think walking is the best way to get your sugar down along with a high protein, high fiber and low carb diet. I walk a lot! In south Florida it rains so I walk around the house. I’ve gotten done great advise from the people in this community.

Both my parents are diabetic, and I guess genetics + lifestyle finally caught up to me.\n\nHere are my numbers from a recent lab report:\n\nFasting glucose: 273 mg/dL (normal 70–110)\n\nHbA1c: 10.6% (average ~257 mg/dL over last 3 months)\n\nUrine sugar: ++ (so high that it’s spilling into urine)\n\nLipids, kidney, liver, thyroid → all normal right now (thank god).\n\nVitamin D → very low (12.6, should be &gt;30).\n\n\nI don’t have extreme symptoms like thirst, tingling, or vision loss. Mostly just fatigue. My doc told me to completely change my diet and lifestyle first, and we’ll see if meds are needed later. He didn’t order a C-peptide or antibody test, but since I was overweight (91kg at 182cm, now ~88kg), and both parents are Type 2, he thinks I’m most likely Type 2 diabetes rather than Type 1.\n\nStill, I’m young and this hit me hard. My parents are so sad  and broken when they found out, and that broke me too. I know a lot of people my age eat like trash, but my genetics mean I can’t get away with it like they can.\n\nRight now I’m going militant with diet + workouts:\n\nOats + whey + seeds + small fruit for breakfast\n\nChicken + veggies + small measured brown rice for lunch\n\nWalnuts or paneer for snacks\n\nProtein + veggies for dinner (low/no carbs at night)\n\nLifting weights 5x/week, walking after meals, some cardio/HIIT\n\n\nMy goal is to drop fasting sugars from 273 into the 120–150 range in the next 40–60 days without meds.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Anyone here diagnosed young (late teens/early 20s) — was it Type 1 or Type 2 in your case?\n\n\n2. Did diet + exercise alone bring your numbers down, or did you need meds right away?\n\n\n3. Any tips on keeping muscle mass while managing sugar (I don’t want to get skinny/weak)?\n\n\n\nThis is all new to me, and honestly scary, but I don’t want to run from it. If I can get control now, maybe I can live strong for decades instead of letting this eat me alive.\n\nAppreciate any advice, stories, or tough truth you’ve got.",

For the next two years I didn’t have time to find a new pcp since all doctors are closed Saturday and Sunday and school had me going from 5:30AM to 8 PM almost every weekday. \n\nAfter graduating this past May I knew it was a priority to get my health in check. I’d been feeling tired all the time too. Got a new PCP, who sent me to endocrinology immediately. My A1C was 11.4 when I started seeing them so she put me on insulin. Our talk plus what I already knew, I made dietary changes but not ones as strict as yours, and the changes I made are working so far. I am hoping to get on Ozempic or Mounjaro soon to lessen the amount of insulin I’ll need. But waiting to hear about that for now. A month into insulin and my A1C was back to a 9.0, so at least it’s helping. \n\nUntil now dieting is something that never really worked for me. Some might blame it on my own willpower, but I am also severely adhd with anxiety/depression, and food was always a comfort for me to run to for anything going on in life. That’s changing a little now that I’m working on keeping my numbers in range but I still refuse to call it dieting because that makes it so much less motivating for me. So for now Ive just been calling it “better choices” lol. \n\nAs for exercise, that’s also always been hard for me. I have extreme head/facial sweating anytime my body does more than a short or slow walk. This sweating makes it hard to breathe, see, and tolerate exercise due to feeling extremely uncomfortable. But I’ve found that swimming, yoga, and building my walking tolerance has been helpful so far. \n\nHope this finds you in better spirits, diabetes SUCKS, but you seem to be on an even better track than me with your mindset!",

Insulin and metformin is what they put me in right away because I went into the hospital with blood sugar up to 732. I was beyond not having to take medications. 💊 it took time to adjust my diet and the meds to kick in. I struggle for a very very long time. Until about 4 years ago they put me on. Ozempic. I lost 35 pounds, along with exercising I am now off all the insulin and metformin. 😎 I literally credit the Ozempic so much.   3. Excerise and protien 👏🏼 is my best advice on that.  \n\nI know it scary as hell and being 10 years a diabetic I am still learning but it’s possible to better yourself. The thing that kept me going was that I promised myself that I would never ever let the Diabetes win ever. Now my A1C is a 5.2 and my fasting sugar is 92. \n\nYou got this I promise",

Request a c-peptide test anyway. Your age should be sufficient to justify the test. Losing weight was probably good for your health but if you are type 1 it will not help control your blood glucose levels.\n\n&gt;***Oats*** \\+ whey + seeds + ***small fruit*** for breakfast\n\n&gt;Chicken + veggies + small measured ***brown rice*** for lunch\n\n&gt;Walnuts or paneer for snacks\n\n&gt;Protein + veggies for dinner (low/no carbs at night)\n\nRegardless of your type that can be improved. I know people will have told you those choices are healthy but for type 2 it is all about carbohydrates, not calories. For example I have highlighted the danger foods in your list. I presume you now have either a home blood glucose meter or a continuous glucose monitor. Use it to modify your menu for healthy blood glucose levels.

If it’s a deal breaker consider steel cut only, but I love oats and just have to avoid them at the moment because it’s not worth it.  2. Watch the cholesterol.  Consider getting yours checked.

        "body": "Welcome to the club. Some personal experience to answer your questions. Be aware that these are my experiences, and diabetes can react very differently for every person. \n\n1. I was diagnosed about 6 months ago at 27. My fasting sugar was 252 and my A1c was 10.3. Like you everyone in my immediate family is diabetic, and my diagnosis was Type 2 diabetes. \n\n2. I just had my follow up and my fasting sugar was 108 and my A1c was 5.9. I am on 1000 mg of metformin a day that my doctor has said may not be necessary anymore, but I have continued to take it for other health reasons. Other than the metformin, I went very hard on diet and lifestyle changes for about the first month. I cut out all refined carbs, sugars, and artificial sweeteners to give my body a reset. I have a continuous glucose monitor, and over the summer I have slowly started adding back into my diet while being mindful of how it’s impacting my blood sugar (do I get a spike and for how long). \n\n3. This is gonna be the hard one. Eat the proper amount of protein ( I have to supplement because I don’t get enough through diet alone) and make sure you work strength training into your routine and you should be fine. If you can afford to do so, work with a nutritionist and/or trainer to help you figure out your plan. If you can’t, some apps may help you keep track. \n\nIt’s so scary. I cried when I first got the bloodwork results and felt so defeated, but I have found that being young has helped my body adjust very well. Don’t go all or nothing, that will setup yourself for failure. If you have a bad meal or day or week, it’s okay. Just start again at the next meal. I’m big on “I’m living with diabetes” and not “I can’t have that because I have diabetes.” I eat cake at celebrations, and if I have a real craving for something like pasta or bread, I’ll eat a small portion of it with a big portion of protein. I eat protein first, then my vegetables, and then finish my meals with any carbs. I find that keeps me fuller and I’ll eat less carbs and helps my body digest the protein first which helps sometimes with the spike. Try and ask for a cgm. It helps tremendously. Other than that, you’ve got this!",

For a banana, stick to having only half and pair with some protein and fat. Dipping the banana in a bit of softened peanut butter would work, slicing it up and mixing it into some plain Greek yogurt would work too, having as desert after dinner could also be an option.\n\nPersonally, I can't stand bananas when they are still green, but I do try to avoid them when they get spots on the skin, they are too sweet then.",

I was supposed to get an a1c done but for whatever reason they didn’t do it and at the time I didn’t really know to ask. \n\nAll my numbers were good or great except vitamin d (25) and testosterone was a bit low. \n\nI started testosterone replacement and over the counter Vitamin D3.  \n\nI was also on pretty powerful steroid drops for two months for a corneal ulcer unrelated to all this. (I guess it was unrelated!) I didn’t know at the time that steroid drops mess with your glucose. \n\nFor the first week I saw some 130’s, but mostly around 110. After finishing my steroids last week, I have been having normal bg readings. \n\nI haven’t changed my diet. I was already doing very low carbs. I increased my activity though. I’m a teacher and I went back to work. I am regularly getting over 20,000 steps a day and I e been jogging a little. I haven’t really lost any weight. \n\nI don’t take any medication other than the testosterone and I have only taken one dose of that. \n\nI’m no longer convinced I am actually diabetic. Sunday night I experimented and ate 4 slices of a pepperoni pizza. It spiked to 144 but was 72 less than two hours later.  I haven’t had carbs like that in months. (And it was glorious.)\n\nI think need all new bloodwork and maybe a new doctor. Btw I am a 53 year old male.  \n\nShould I wait a few weeks and check again? I mean I guess I kinda doesn’t make a difference since I am kinda in the prediabetes range and I will need to improve diet and exercise anyway, but it bugs me. \n\n\n\n",

Today I'm writing this and I'm thinking about any reason why I didn't take it seriously. I can't find a reason why I didn't. \n\nAt the beginning of 2024 I noticed changes in my vision. I had a gray area show up in my right eyes vision. My left eye the vision started to suffer as well. In February I went to get my eyes checked by a a regular eye doctor, and they said I had to go see a specialist right away, like they wanted me to see them that same day. I went to see them, and the severity of the damage of my eyes was really bad, there was hemorrhaging, their scar tissue, blood vessels growing all over and pulling on my retinas. I had developed retinopathy years before and by the time I saw the doctors it had turned into full-blown tractional diabetic retinopathy. I had severe SVD on my retina as well. We started out with treatments to help get a foothold and try to control the blood vessel in scar tissue growth, and let me tell you those laser treatments are not fun. They suck and they hurt a lot. By the time July rolled around, both of my retinas had detached and My doctor told me that I am legally blind now and possibly going to go blind. \n\nBecause of how the blood vessels in the eyes and on kidneys are The same, there's a very likely chance that my kidneys are suffering and could be damaged. That in and of itself is dangerous and quite scary. \n\nI'm sharing this because I hope that it can honestly scare some of you into actually caring.",

    "selftext": "I posted on here back in May after I was newly diagnosed with an A1C of 10 and fasting blood sugar of 264. The grief and shame I felt was so overwhelming I really thought I was not going to make it. That first week was torture in my own mind. It seems so dramatic now but I truly believed I ruined my body. I am only 28 and just felt my life was over. My first thought when I saw those labs were “I’m eating keto and will never touch a carb again”. I pouted and starved myself for a few days and then snapped back to reality. I got some good advice here and I made a plan with my doctor. He started me on Metformin 500mg ER daily and Monjauro. I started tracking macros on the Nourish app and met with a nutritionist on there. I also was luckily in therapy already for my mental health because it took a huge toll. I have really taught myself how to eat mindfully but still have a long way to go. I started exercising although could work harder on this (I enjoy being a couch potato). Today I got my labs back for my 3 month check and was so anxious to see them. But I am feeling so hopeful and motivated now. I was able to bring my A1C to a 6, fasting blood sugar to 116 and am down 25 pounds. \n\nMy point in making this post is to thank everyone that spends time on here helping people who are new to diabetes. I also want to let anyone who is scared and sad about your diagnosis to know that this is not your fault. But the way you handle it and take control of your life after is. If I can do this, anyone can. ",

It's something to be proud of.\n\nOn the exercise thing I too have never been too keen on it. What helped me was habit, and learning via experiments with CGMs that I have more freedom with what I can eat if I go for a walk afterwards.  Walking doesn't feel like so much hard work to me compared to something like the gym.  Less monotonous.  I found that once I got into the habit of going for a walk around 30 minutes after the meal with the most carbs in a day, which helps both with blood glucose management and with overall health, it eventually got to the point where I feel an urge to do it at least once a day.  It became a habit, a time to clear my head, and I miss it if I don't get my walk in, so long as the weather allows it.  It seems that the more regularly you do it the better it feels.  You actually start to miss it when you can't get your walk in.  Just a thought - that's just what helped me get off the couch.\n\nBest of luck!",

Im sweating and dizzy as I write this. \n\nYesterday I got lowered from 1000mg to 500mg of metformin because of it. My question is, how long will it take for my body to adjust to the lower dosage?

My blood sugars sometimes were good but a lot of time they were in the 140 - 150 range for a few hours. I ate a bunch of popcorn once and it went up to 200 when checking on a meter.

Could it be a glitch and if pulled the result from last year?   When my endo checked it in Feb it was 6.8.  Granted I was off Mounjaro for a few months at that time.  I’m on 5 mg now and was on it when I was at 5.4 last year.    I’ve done intermittent fasting but only this last week so that wouldn’t change results.  ",

I hope things continue to go well for you.\n\nI would caution about following the advice of the typical information source you'll find on YouTube though.  Dr. Eric Berg for example is a chiropractor, not a medical doctor, and he has 5,600+ videos on YouTube.  He's very far from an expert on diabetes and given the wide variety and sheer volume of topics he posts about it's fair to say he's much more an expert in self-promotion than he is an expert in medicine.\n\nThere is very little good material about Type 2 on YouTube though this long interview with Prof Roy Taylor is worth a watch.  Unlike the great majority of personalities on YouTube he's an actual expert on Type 2, a professor of medicine, diabetologist and diabetes researcher:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbQvaE4VmJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbQvaE4VmJg)\n\nIn the area of low-carb dieting Dr. David Unwin is a source of some good information, though if you look under the surface you'll find that Roy Taylor's science explains pretty much everything that Unwin has observed in his diabetic patients:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dShYGV1xM6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dShYGV1xM6w)",

One of my own yardsticks when evaluating what influencers have to say about diet relates to statins - whether the person knows what they're talking about and/or is honest in their opinion.  I searched 'Dr. Ken Berry statins' and found this video.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=B6IC9sfn\\_ZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=B6IC9sfn_ZM)\n\nThe paper that Dr. Berry is talking about can be found here:\n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790055](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790055)\n\nIn the text of the paper can be found this paragraph:\n\n\"The cardiovascular benefits of treatment with statins are sometimes reported as RRR. However, reporting RRR without the corresponding ARR or number-needed-to-treat of a treatment can be misleading. For example, in our analysis, the RRR for MI was 29%, whereas the ARR was 1.3%. In other words, 77 participants would need to be treated with a statin for roughly 4.4 years on average to prevent 1 MI.\"\n\nRRR is Relative Risk Reduction.  ARR is Absolute Risk Reduction.  MI is Myocardial Infarction - a heart attack.  In other words, if 77 people in the study takes a statin, 1 of them will not have a heart attack they would otherwise have had within a span of around 4.4 years.\n\nMisrepresenting what Absolute Risk actually means when it comes to short clinical trial results is one of the hallmarks of health and wellness influencers who either don't know what they're talking about or are being less than honest.  This is one video that explains why 4.4 years isn't very long when it comes to comparing RRR with ARR for a medications that is meant to be taken for, and is most effective, over decades of a person's life.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRRD8nXEyGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRRD8nXEyGM)\n\nYou can judge for yourself of course but as a general rule I believe the 'I know the truth and your doctor is wrong' type of health influencer on YouTube is to be avoided.  A diabetic taking Dr. Berry's word for it when it comes to statins for example might well find themselves in their grave a little earlier than if they were never exposed to the 'ARR is more important than RRR, cholesterol is meaningless' line of BS that you'll find amongst some in the Keto influencer community.",

        "body": "I am assuming you live in the US. If you have health insurance I would recommend pushing your doctor to give you a prescription for a finger prick test kit/glucose monitor to test what foods affect your blood sugar. It is much cheaper getting it through insurance. But you can buy glucose monitors over the counter or even online on Amazon. I was also scared of pricking my finger, but it isn't so bad. It feels like an ant bite to me haha. \n\nPersonally, along with my glucose monitor, I have been using the Dexcom Stelo glucose biosensor (its a thing you stick to your arm for 2 weeks to continuously monitor your blood sugar). It might not always be accurate but it helps me to realize what foods spike me. I use my glucose monitor to prick and see once in a while if my Stelo is accurate or not. But just a warning, Stelo can be quite pricey. A month of monitoring (2 biosensors that last 2 weeks each) is around $100. If you buy a subscription (1 or 3 months) it is slightly cheaper. If you have a FSA with your employer, you can use it to pay for it. Overall, Stelo made me very aware of what spikes me like fruits or potatoes and that eating blueberries with greek yogurt spikes me less. It gives me a sense of control and less anxiety. Hopefully this helps you out. I'm pretty new in my journey too and started taking control of my health this year.",

        "body": "A former teacher turned Technology Director here. Also fairly recently diagnosed type 2 (5 months ago). Have always been overweight, a fast foodie, and soda drinker. My story and things I've done that may help or give encouragement. \n\nWhen I got diagnosed, my A1C was 10.8. My doctor initially had me on 1000mg extended release Metformin twice per day, morning Jardiance, morning Atorvastatin, and evening Lisinopril. She also tried to get Ozempic, but insurance denied a it and also said I had to wait 30 days before having an approved GLP1 (2.5 Mounjaro).\n\nShe didn't do a good job explaining a good diet, and I've always been a bit food restrictive and extremely carb heavy. I also overreacted a bit. Came home and threw away probably $200 worth of food, snacks, drinks, etc. Was barely eating and it was also state testing time so stressed. I literally had some days where I ate a grand total of 8 carbs and 300ish calories. Between a \"carb detox\" and the meds, my system was wrecked. \n\nI went into a deep dive on tiktok and YouTube. Knew I needed to lose weight and cut carbs and almost all sugars. So, I started on carnivore and then shifted to a \"dirty keto\" method. Currently exploring different things that seem or taste normal instead of some of the questionable tasting alternatives. \n\nSome things that I've liked are Oikos Triple Zero Greek yogurt, of course string cheese, zero sugar jello/pudding, significantly cutting any condiments or swapping to G Hughes sauces, moving to higher protein meats/meals, swapping to Zero Sugar soda (Dr. Pepper Zero is my favorite), and swapping regular sandwich bread to Sara Lee Delightful (I tried Nature's Own keto bread and it just tasted off). I've also just worked on portion control. Snack bag of potato chips instead of just eating from a family sized bag. I also eat a metric ton of meats. Specifically ground beef at present. 93/7 is my usual now. I can do 4 patties at a time with a little bit of sauce, toppings, and Sara Lee delightful with a very negligible bump on my CGM. I've also made some swaps or mods on fast food, because when I'm running from school to school, sometimes I have to do easy. Popeyes Blackened Tenders taste great, are low carb and calorie, and high in protein. Pair with a zero carb tortilla or just by themselves with a diet soda and I'm a happy camper. I've started bringing a loaf of Sara Lee delightful bread to my office and using it instead of a hamburger bun on say a burger from Burger King. No condiments on it. Still some carbs, but a better swap and I can still enjoy it. \n\nWhen I'm out with friends or there's an office party (I know how Christmas is at schools), I'll let myself have very small portions of something that feels normal. A small handful of fries AFTER I've had my protein. A tiny scoop of mac and cheese. Just a couple of chips with a little dip. A very small piece of cake. If I try to continue to just deny myself I know I will absolutely fail. \n\nThat all said, these changes led to this. 3 months later, and I was down to 5.2 A1C and down 35lbs. I then increased my 2.5 Mounjaro to 5. Caused my blood glucose to go low consistently, so my Doc said I could come off Metformin. Kept everything else.\n\n2 months since then and I'm down another 20lbs with an average glucose reading in the upper 70s/low 80s range. I've seen my readings go up to 120-140 range after eating and then be back to normal inside 2 hours. \n\nIt takes work, and a mindset change, but life is much better now. Yes, I have to be cognizant of what I eat. But with time, I've come to see it as a chance to get healthier for the rest of my years. Feel free to DM if I can ever recommend or help. I get the unique challenges being a teacher.",

I’m very new to this world and am learning a lot.\n\nI just wanted to see if anyone has any advice/thoughts.\n\nContext - I’m 35, train 5 times a week (mixture of functional fitness/running) don’t really have any weight to lose (5,10 and 75kg) have eaten well, but allowed myself to snack because I train hard.\n\nI am also a part time baker… so I know my carb intake can reduce. Eating context - pre this finding I would have porridge for breakfast, poached eggs on toast for lunch and some kind of healthy dinner maybe with a carb.\n\nSince finding I’m pre diabetic - measure 47 on the test. (48 being actual type 2)- I have:\n\n- dropped any refined carbs\n- completely cut out snacking\n- fast from 8-12/1pm\n- eat a balance of greens, proteins and good fats (avos etc).\n- occasionally have whole wheat noodles in small quantities for dinner.\n\nSupplements taken daily:\n\n- berberine\n- fibre pre meal\n- magnesium\n- yerme mate tea.\n\nI am 2 weeks into my monitoring. And an average daily read looks like the images attached.\n\nBe great to get some thoughts/feedback etc\n\nHow long should it be before you should see some changes?\n\nThanks everyone! Hoping sharing this journey will help as I learn. As all i have been medically told is ‘exercise and eat well’\n\nThanks ✌️",

Doing that can actually make insulin resistance worse. When your body is insulin resistant, it struggles to use sugar properly, stores fat more easily, and triggers stronger cravings. Fighting it with your willpower alone is like trying to empty a flooded house with a teaspoon.\n\nGLP-1 is a natural hormone your body makes to help control appetite and blood sugar. Instead of forcing it with synthetic drugs, you can support your body’s own production. I personally use an all-natural system that has been shown to boost natural GLP-1 by nearly 70%! It's been helping to curb my cravings, support weight loss, and improve insulin sensitivity, all without forcing or starving myself.\n\nThe key is addressing the root cause, which is insulin resistance, rather than just trying to eat less. With the right approach, your body can start working with you again instead of against you. Let me know if you'd like more details.",

        "body": "Found the thread by chance!\n\nI've been dealing with food tracking for a while and I've been analyzing reasons why I and other people fail and how to make it more sustainable on the long run. So I think I can share and perhaps be a bit helpful!\n\nSo, I found that there are a few keys to better sustainability. \n\nThe first and the most basic one is the reason why you're tracking meals. If you're tracking it purely because it's \"good\" or \"useful\" or whatever – nah. It's only useful if you make it useful.\n\n... and if it's useless, no matter how hard you try to trick your brain, it will find ways to avoid doing the tedious task.\n\nSo, you gotta figure out what exactly you're gonna get from that. Just writing down might not be enough — gotta believe that what you're doing, works.\n\nOnce you've dealt with that, here's the cornerstone of sustainability:\n\n**Logging requires discipline**. Discipline heavily depends on you having enough energy and dopamine to make the \"right\" decision. So don't expect a perfect log — you're not gonna log a lot of meals, and that's probably fine. Just get back to it as soon as possible.\n\nOn top of that, know that you need to find a log with the optimal amount of complexity. What's optimal is up to you, of course.\n\nThere's a lot of food logs on the market that would require you to enter a detailed breakdown what you ate during every single meal. That is rather cumbersome and is not generally sustainable over the long run. So prefer tools that ask the right amount of questions.\n\nYou might also wanna look for aggregate your meals from different source. Say, you're out in the city, got stuff to do. You go into a cafe, grab a snack, but you've still got to coordinate people, talk to them, etc. Would you remember to open an app and record a meal in that case? I wouldn't. A chatbot, though... It's easier to remember to log a meal if you can do it through the same messenger app.\n\nBUT there are only a few food logs that allow recording meals through multiple sources. If that doesn't look like something you need — feel free to skip, because that's rather difficult to find",

        "body": "Best way I've tracked food was to not track food and ate within set limits like I can eat these types of vegetables so that's what I buy mixed in with any types of meats and make them anyway I want so whatever I'm eating is within my acceptable parameters so I will avoid all pastas and rice but will sometimes eat low carb bread.  If I want a snack sometimes it becomes a little tougher but I will stick with lower carb options like almonds, popcorn, pork rinds, something I've really liked recently were siete grain free chips.  For snacks, it becomes a slippery slope as it's pretty easy to sit there with the bag and munch so I keep it away from me so that I will have to move in order to get a handful and generally that's about what I can have.  \n\nThe problem I had with meal tracking was after doing it for almost a year I got absolutely burned out from it and it drove me nuts but in the process it has taught me how to read labels, understand calories, better understanding of ingredients and just educated me on food.  It's a process everyone should go through just to better themselves but for the long term it was easier on myself to understand what I was eating.  \n\nAlso it's not going to be perfect, you're going to have bad days and eat wrong and that's ok.  Do a little more exercise that day and stay on track, don't let it get out of control because you had a minor setback.  It's fine and you'll just move on and keep working at it.",

    "selftext": "Hello all, seeking out some advice and guidance as just reading on the Internet doesn't tend to give out real lived experience. \n\nThis morning I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and put straight on metformin twice a day. This seems to have really come out of nowhere to be entirely honest. I was having a fresh round of blood tests to see if my white blood cells and lipid levels had changed at all. Never before have I had a high HBA1c reading in all my life. For context I am a 31 year old female. I also had a vertebral artery dissection and small stroke two years ago, so I have been putting my cold/weak/numb left leg and foot down to that but I'm wondering if maybe it could be to do with the diabetes. My HBA1c levels on fasting was 59 (was 56 the month prior without fasting) is this really high? \n\nMy main queries are, aside from the metformin, I obviously know I need to make some changes to my diet and lifestyle. I have recently heavily cut down on smoking. I don't eat an awful lot at all, but when I do it is usually carbohydrate heavy. Any ideas or recommendations for changing my diet? Things to avoid/add/cut down/incorporate? \n\nAlso, should I expect any side effects from metformin? I'm going to struggle with taking it with a meal in the mornings as I honestly don't really eat until evening and don't have a massive appetite. \n\nRest assured, since I've been really poorly and keep getting back such negative blood results, I am slowly but surely trying to make much better decisions with my lifestyle. But I'm really wondering just how much a poor diet and lack of exercise contributes to this diagnosis as like I said, it seems to have just come from nowhere and I can't even say I noticed any symptoms either. \n\nBit of a ramble I know, very sorry for that. Just abit overwhelmed and bewildered and I guess I want to know how much this diagnosis is going to change and affect my life. \n\nMany thank yous in advance. X",

When lab results come back compare results.\n\nMy sticks and CGM are within 2% (often identical) of the lab.  (CGMs could be +/- more if blood glucose is not stable because are about 5 minutes delayed).\n\nI am a life long T2, tightly control my BG and have used glucose testers and CGMs from the major suppliers. I use insulin both inhaled and by injection therefore, accuracy is necessary for correct dosage. I could write a book about my experiences of T2 and treatments. \n\nOver the years, I've used maybe 10 manufacturers of glucose meters. Often found large differences in reported levels, before confirming who was the best.\n\nSome things I discovered: the weekly CGM designs (such as Dexcom and Abbott) share some similar problems. Social media has thousands of posts and discussions or rants but still many people are aware or understand the limitations and device issues.\n\nOften there has been a wide variance between both accuracy and repeatability when switching to the next sensor. Where they are installed (even inches different), skin condition and alignment have impacted the results and life of the sensors. \n\nOften the 1st 24 to 48 and sometimes the last 24 hours of the sensor will be unreliable. If the sensor had less than 30 days remaining (expiration date), these units gave me the most errors and failures (Bluetooth connection, accuracy, early ending and more).\n\nThe above issues are mostly due to the devices design and therefore unavoidable.\n\nI have software that allows using more than one sensor at the same time. This is how I discovered the above issues. Unfortunately, most users are unaware but one day will experience them and wonder why. \n\nWhen I saw unexpected swings, (no causing reason) or suspect numbers, I ignored, but watch or use a finger test to verify.\n\nI have found acceptable devices and good solutions. Today, I use a Dexcom G7 as my 2nd (backup) CGM because it is calibratable (Libres are not).  My primary CGM is an Eversense 365 because it doesn't have the above issues and works great for a whole year.\n\nI use a Contour Next One glucose meter and the Eversense 365 CGM because I have found them to be far superior (more accurate) than all others.",

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with diabetes 3 weeks ago after being admitted to hospital after a routine blood test showed A1C at 13% and then also detected very high level ketones (3.1) in blood. I didn't go into DKA (normal PH). I was put on a drip to lower ketones and glucose in blood, then discharged home. Then I saw the Diabetes team in clinic 2 days later and I was started on basal–bolus insulin. The team explained I very likely had type 1 / LADA. I suggested the possibility of type 2 because of a very strong family history but they said this was incredibly unlikely because of the ketones in my blood and my profile. But they ordered a full panel of antibodies to rule out - and they've all come back negative. Now they have said they have ruled out type 1 and I have type 2.\n\nWhat confuses me is the ketone levels in my blood. I thought ketosis and risk of DKA usually pointed more strongly to type 1. I’ve been reading a bit about ketosis-prone type 2 (sometimes called Flatbush diabetes), and I wondered if anyone here has experience with this? The team said I can't have this because I'm not of the demographic that has ketone-prone type 2/ flatbush - but then also couldn't answer why my ketones in my blood were so high with a type 2 diagnosis.\n\nSome details:\n\n* Female, Age 34, lean body type, active, but strong family history of type 2 on my father’s side. Always knew I'd eventually get type 2 but shocked at an a1c of 13%, and the presence of ketones.\n* Needed insulin from diagnosis, but now moving to add metformin.\n* Ratios currently very insulin resistant for carbs, despite being lean. I'm only on 5units Lantus at night which keeps me steady overnight at 6mmol, but my insulin to carb ratio is 1:3 at breakfast, and 1:5 at lunch (even less on non-exercise days).\n* Ketones were present on diagnosis (close to DKA).\n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience? If you were ketosis-prone T2, were you eventually able to come off insulin, or reduce it significantly? Did your doctors run a C-peptide test to guide the diagnosis? I requested a fasting c-peptide but they declined to do this.\n\nI’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and trying to understand, so any insights or personal stories would really help.",

My husband took me to the emergency room and from there I  was admitted to the ICU with DKA. I talked my doctor about LADA, but he wants me to try Monjourna first before he gives me the C-Peptide test. I will start the the Monjourna this weekend and give it a try, but I'm beginning to strongly suspect I was misdiagnosed with Type 2 all those years ago and actually have LADA. I should mentioned that I have been using the Keto diet to help control my blood sugar, so I wasn't surprised there were some ketones in my blood test but DKA is a whole new level of hell.\n\nIf your doctor refuses to run a C-peptide test, I would honestly find a new doctor.",

        "body": "Absolutely, many individuals have experienced success with reversing diabetes! Particularly those focused on addressing the root cause, insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. Reversing insulin resistance is not only possible but has been achieved through specific lifestyle changes.\n\nAdopting a whole-food diet can significantly improve insulin sensitivity.  Incorporating both soluble and insoluble fiber can slow digestion and reduce glucose spikes. Also, adding healthy fats into your diet, like olive oil and avocados, along with proteins from eggs and nuts, can enhance GLP-1. Our body naturally produces that hormone, and it helps regulate blood sugar and appetite.\n\nTime-based eating or intermittent fasting can help regulate blood sugar levels. That gives your body a break from producing insulin and allows your levels to come down.\n\nI’ve personally found a system that’s proven and patented to help reverse insulin resistance, and it made a massive difference for me. The only reason I started using it is because of all the science behind it. It boosts your body’s natural GLP-1 by almost 70%. If you ever want to hear more, I’m happy to share!",

If you haven't been diabetic for too many years then big weight loss may \\*partially\\* reverse problems with the beta cells in the pancreas which produce insulin, but there's probably lasting damage that will persist.  The combination of resolving insulin resistance in the liver and partially reversing problems in the pancreas may result in remission.  How tightly a person has to manage their carb intake after that varies from person to person.  'Reversal' isn't a good word for this as it's only ever partial, though the word 'management' as used in many of the other comments isn't ideal either as it doesn't convey that actual physical improvement of the underlying disease condition and halting disease progression is possible.\n\nIf any programs out there work they do it through weight loss and/or lowering carb intake.  You don't need a program for that - any way to lose weight that suits you may work.  Lose weight if you can afford to lose it, exercise, build and maintain muscle mass if you can as it may help, and moderate your carb intake to 'eat within your means' - that's what 'reversal' comes down to.",

                "body": "How much to reduce carb intake in the early days after diagnosis is a matter of choice.  In my own case I did not learn about low-carb dieting and take it seriously for many months after diagnosis, but I learned about remission through weight loss very early on.  I focused on calories, not carbs, but still saw a huge improvement in my A1C results as I lost weight.  Reducing calories did lead to a reduction in carbs as a side effect but I was still eating white bagels and plenty of fruit for example.  Moderate carbs but not particularly low.\n\nLooking back I was probably eating an unwise amount of carbs, but I wasn't testing my blood or using CGMs so I don't know how high I was sending my blood glucose levels after meals and so don't know how unwise it was.  Soon after I started testing I settled on around 100 to 120g (net) carbs per day, with breakfast being the meal with the least carbs as BG levels tend to spike most after the first meal of the day. I still ate fruit but in small portions - a little mandarin/tangerine orange or a small 'fun size' apple with breakfast for example.\n\nLater when experimenting with CGMs I learned how big a difference moderate exercise after meals can make in 'blunting the spike' - preventing levels from getting unhealthily high after meals with a fair amount of carbs.  I go for a walk beginning around 30 minutes after one or two meals per day when the weather allows, and walk for 30 to 60 minutes depending on the meal and if I have the time and energy.  Because I do this the amount of carbs I eat in a day these days varies from less than 100 up to maybe 200g per day.  A breakfast of two slices of whole grain toast, eggs and a little orange or apple is around 45 grams for example, and it takes a 35 minute walk afterwards to blunt the spike from that meal for me personally.  If I can't go for a walk after breakfast I eat something like an omelette or Greek yogurt with berries and crushed nuts, which would be 30 grams or less.  I don't think in terms of carbs per day but treat breakfasts, lunches and dinners separately and have low carb options and moderate carbs options (that need a walk after) which I choose depending on whether I can walk afterwards or not.\n\nYou would need to do your own blood testing to find out how your own meal choices affect you, bearing in mind that two identical meals eaten for breakfast and lunch will tend to produce a smaller spike after lunch than breakfast, due to the Second Meal Phenomenon.  Best of luck!",

It had been over twenty-five years since she had visited a doctor. She has been smoking for around 30 years and still smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. She told us that her legs hurt at the beginning of May. After claiming that her foot was numb, she eventually visited a walk-in clinic in July. They discovered she has diabetes at this point. She has gone for two different kinds of ultrasounds on her legs. She eventually finds a new family physician; he requested that she undergo a CT scan to rule out a stroke. In a letter, he instructed us to take her to the emergency room (8-hour wait and 5 cigarettes). She goes to a vascular specialist in September. Her foot is still numb, and she still smokes like a fiend. My question is, do you think that she will lose her foot since she has not had any feeling in it since July?

    "selftext": "This is a draft!  I welcome the community's criticism. :)\n\nMost likely you have joined this sub because your doctor informed you that you're pre-diabetic.\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\n* Medically, this means that your latest  **Hemoglobin A1C** reading or readings are above 5.9% (the threshold may vary slightly for different medical establishments).\n* My non-medical opinion is that being pre-diabetic simply means that your body is gently telling you that you should change your lifestyle. You're probably not in any immediate danger if this is your only health indicator of concern, but you should make changes now.\n\n**What are your next steps?**\n\n* Being pre-diabetic is not the end of the road for you. Reframe how you think about this diagnosis. You are being given a chance to fix this, and with a lot of work and positive energy, you can reverse this, or perhaps more accurately, achieve a state of healthy remission as long as you make a permanent lifestyle change. \n* This is a support group. It's not intended to offer medical advice. The first step is to speak with your doctor about your medical next steps because everyone's body is different, and your own path to remission may require specialized medical advice.   \nIn the meantime... \n\n1. Stay calm, and respect your body.\n2. Cut out sugars (simple sugars, starches, and highly processed foods) as much as reasonable.\n3. What works for me? I got a blood glucose meter and gamified (turned a mundane task into something fun) my lifestyle change by always ensuring that my blood sugar stays in range. This means that I am always aware that if I eat this sweet food, will it send my next reading out of range? This has worked well for me.\n4. Most doctors don't talk about exercise, rather, they focus on food choices. But for me, increasing my fitness has done wonders. I have literary increased my walking steps from a pathetic 2000 steps per week, to 35000 or more steps per work.\n5. Just losing 15lbs (8kg) may have a significant positive impact on your overall health. Set a goal to lose this much weight in 3 months. It's important to always set realistic goals. Then repeat this goal over the next 3 months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nDon't stress out and be patient! I cannot emphasize this enough.   \nYou can manage the condition, you can go into remission, and it is even possible to reverse your pre-diabetic condition. Reversal or remission is said to be achieved if you maintain a normal A1C for a minimum of six months. But achieving this goal will take time and effort, perhaps even a frustrating amount of time and effort.    \n\n\nNote: Your **Hemoglobin A1C** reading is also a lagging indicator that may take 3 to 6 months to show any changes after your lifestyle change.",

My impression is over 10 is sufficient for concern, but again there are multiple indicators of metabolic health that should be considered together. \n\nQuote below from Levels website : \n\n“What Insulin Level Should We Aim For?\n\nDue to insulin being overlooked for so long, there is no scientific consensus on optimal insulin levels. Medical experts take a wide variety of positions on the matter, and a standard reference range has not been established. Generally speaking, we know that lower is better. But where exactly the “danger zone” begins and where insulin becomes harmful are points of contention.\nFirst, consider the reference range published by the physician resource Medscape, It suggests that normal fasting plasma insulin (a common measure of blood insulin levels) should stay under 25 microunits per milliliter (μU/mL). Note, however, that many metabolic health experts consider this range too high. Below, we’ve summarized comments from five Levels advisors— all suggest that fasting insulin should stay below 10 μU/mL.\n\nDr. Mark Hyman: Head of Strategy and Innovation at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, author of 14 best-selling books, focuses on the role of food as medicine.\nSuggested range: 2–5 μU/mL\n\nDom D’Agostino, PhD: Associate Professor at the University of South Florida, leading researcher in neuro implications of keto, runs Keto Nutrition.\nSuggested range: 2-6 μU/mL\n\nDr. David Perlmutter: leading expert in neurodegeneration and metabolic health, author of five best-selling books, including Grain Brain.\nSuggested range: Less than 8 μU/mL\n\nBen Bikman, PhD: Associate Professor at Brigham Young University, leading insulin researcher and author of Why We Get Sick.\nSuggested range: Less than 10 μU/mL\n\nDr. Rob Lustig: Professor emeritus of Pediatrics at UCSF, research and clinical focus on childhood obesity and diabetes, author of four books about the dangers of sugar and processed food.\nSuggested range: Less than 10 μU/mL”",

When I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, I turned to Reddit for support group, but at the time this sub had been abandoned with no moderator and no way for new people to join. So I just took over and despite my insane work schedule, I try to find some time to help out here. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, I was very fortunate to have access to a team of doctors, nutritionists, a group therapy program, and multiple follow ups. Depending on the country you live in, many of you don’t have that kind of support. :(  But my intention is that this group can help provide that support and encouragement that we all need. \n\n[Ha… I’m trying to write but I’m being interrupted by an emergency earthquake preparedness announcement]\n\nOkay…\n\nMy path to wellness is going quite well as long as I keep the awareness that my actions have consequences. I check my blood glucose once every morning (at about 12h after my last meal) and that result determines the type and quantity of breakfast. I’ve cut out all additional sugars, and sweet food (including a lot of starches like bread), except for fruit, in moderation. I occasionally reward myself if I’ve maintained a normal blood glucose reading, or I’m hypoglycemic (it’s happened a few times). \n\nBeing pre-diabetic simply means that a lifestyle change is important if you want to improve your overall health. It should never be a source of stress. Despite some negative people in this sub, being pre-diabetic is “reversible” with a lifestyle change of healthy habits. This fact comes from both my doctors and nutritionists. Additionally, my own A1C has dropped in the past year by a few points in two four month apart readings. My next blood test will be about six months since the last one, if this reading is lower, then it will signal a trend towards no longer being pre-diabetic. \n\nBut it’s important to understand that for us to remain below that threshold will require a life-long commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re 20, 40, or 80… being pre-diabetic isn’t anywhere remotely a “death sentence” and it’s in your power to change your situation. \n\nSo, please don’t worry… in fact, in my humble opinion, worry might be more unhealthy than the condition of pre-diabetes. \n\nHopefully this helps. \n\nWishing you good health.",

You can watch YouTube, television, and Reddit's scroller plus a music channel helps. Walk the dog. Exercise after eating. Work your way up to 3mph. Cut out all other hobbies. If you wake up too early to walk the dog because it's chilly, that's when you do your chores. KEEP PUSHING YOURSELF.\n* Low Carb: Use a refrigerator calendar to track your meals, and plan them out a few days ahead. If you're bored, prep your next meal. Make lunch from leftovers and leftover ingredients if you don't like cooking. Trader Joe's and Costco have many pre-prepared low carb food, and search on \"keto grocery list\" for staple foods for recipes. Binder clips and clip boards to organize recipes, white boards to keep track of ingredients, prepared foods, and recipes you can make.\n* Intermittent Fasting: 12 hours of fasting is easiest. Exercise at the beginning of your fast right after you eat, and extend your fasting window with exercise and a shower, as well as wasting time on the internet. :P\n* Water and Tea: Easier to drink more when you add exercise. Also was easier to give up sweeteners for some reason.\n* Tracker: I use a blank weekly calendar to track various bits of information, as well as for calendar stuff. Using a tracker for your diet has been shown to be effective for weight loss.\n* Glucose meter: Inexpensive on Amazon. You don't have to measure your glucose level every day. Also, use a scale once your blood sugar goes down, since you'll be losing (water) weight.\n\nMyself, I had a blood sugar reading of 160+ earlier in the month, and reduced it to 93+ after a few weeks.

What is pre-diabetes and how does it differ from diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Pre-diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. It differs from diabetes in that it can often be managed and even reversed with lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication, especially when it's not related to weight and lifestyle factors. Without proper management, pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes. Unlike diabetes, pre-diabetes doesn't typically doesn't result in severe health problems often associated with diabetes if managed early and effectively. But if you do become diabetic does it mean that you will suffer from severe health complications? No, NO, NO! Many people with diabetes (type 1 and 2) live full and healthy lives if they manage their illness with proper diligence!

What does A1C mean and what is the range for pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *A1C is a blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. For pre-diabetes, the A1C range is typically between 5.7% and 6.4%. An A1C level below 5.7% is considered normal, while an A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests \\*may\\* indicate diabetes. Whenever you have a reading of over 5.x (your physician is best to determine the value of concern), it is important to make changes and get at least 2 A1C readings per year to watch for a trend (staying the same or going up/down).*\n* **Q. What are the medical indicators that determine if I'm pre-diabetic?*****Answer:*** \\*Pre-diabetes is typically diagnosed based on blood sugar levels. Key indicators include an A1C level between 5.7% and 6.4%, 8h fasting blood sugar levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (*5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)*, or an oral glucose tolerance test showing blood sugar levels between 140 and 199 mg/dL (\\*7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) *two hours after drinking a sugary drink.*\n* **Q. Can I be diagnosed with pre-diabetes even if I am not overweight?*****Answer:*** *Yes, while being overweight is a risk factor for pre-diabetes, individuals of any weight can develop it. Other factors like genetics, age, and lifestyle also play a significant role.*\n* **Q. Does a family history of diabetes increase my risk of pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, having a family history of diabetes can increase your risk of developing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. It's important to share your family medical history with your healthcare provider for an accurate risk assessment.*\n* **Q. Can children develop pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, children can develop pre-diabetes, although it's less common than in adults. Risk factors for children include being overweight, having a family history of type 2 diabetes, and leading a sedentary lifestyle. It's important for children at risk to undergo regular screenings.*\n* **Q. Is pre-diabetes reversible, and how can I manage it?*****Answer:*** *Pre-diabetes can often be managed and sometimes reversed with lifestyle changes. This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, medication may also be prescribed.* It's important to add a caveat here... \"reversible\" simply means that you can certainly get back to a normal A1C, however, you will always need to remain diligent about maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n* **Q. Are there any specific diets recommended for managing pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *There's no one-size-fits-all diet for managing pre-diabetes, but a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is generally recommended. If you're overweight, a medically supervised calorie-reduced diet (by way of carefully monitoring your food consumption or going on a \\*Optifast program) is almost always the most significant means of mitigating a pre-diabetic condition.Reducing intake of processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats is (almost) always beneficial, regardless of your health.*\\* A qualified medical practitioner must authorize Optifast, and it must be purchased directly from Nestlehealthscience; Never purchase it from dishonest Amazon vendors!\n* **Q. Can physical activity help in managing pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, regular physical activity is a key component in managing pre-diabetes. It can help control blood sugar levels, lose weight, and increase insulin sensitivity. Note: as always, every person is different, and in some cases, physical activity may not be a significant component in managing your blood sugar... please seek proper medical advice.*\n* **Q. How often should I get tested for diabetes if I have pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Typically, it's recommended to get your blood sugar levels tested at least once a year (my physician checks me every six months) if you have pre-diabetes. However, your doctor may suggest more frequent testing based on your individual health status.*\n* **Q. Does pre-diabetes always lead to type 2 diabetes*****Answer:*** *No, pre-diabetes does not always progress to type 2 diabetes. With lifestyle changes such as improved diet, increased physical activity, weight loss (if necessary), and/or drug intervention, it's possible to bring blood sugar levels back to a normal range and significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.*\n* **Q. Are there any specific symptoms that indicate my pre-diabetes is turning into diabetes?*****Answer:*** *While pre-diabetes often has no symptoms, signs that it may be progressing to type 2 diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. As always, any of the above symptoms could be attributable to many different conditions, that is why if you notice any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider.*\n* **Q. What are the long-term risks of not managing pre-diabetes effectively?*****Answer:*** *If not managed effectively, pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes, which comes with increased (not guaranteed) risks of heart disease, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve damage. The greater the A1C reading, the greater the health risks.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q. Can stress affect my pre-diabetes?*****Answer:*** *Yes, stress can affect blood sugar levels and make managing pre-diabetes more challenging. It's important to find effective stress-management techniques.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q. I just tested my blood sugar level and I am concerned, it was \\[x\\] reading... am I in trouble / diabetic / pre-diabetic?*****Answer:*** *This might be one of the most frequent type of questions that I see in this subreddit.A single blood sugar reading is generally not enough to determine if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic. To diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes, healthcare professionals rely on a series of tests, including fasting blood sugar levels, A1C tests, and oral glucose tolerance tests, which give a more comprehensive view of your blood sugar regulation over time.*Now, let's talk about that reading... C*onsumer blood glucose meters, the kind you might use at home, have a variable accuracy range, often around 20%. This means two readings taken close together can show different results within this accuracy range. Additionally, blood sugar levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day based on diet, physical activity, stress, and other factors, so one reading is just a snapshot of your blood sugar level at a specific moment and only within a 20% range of its true value. While home glucose meters are valuable tools for monitoring individuals already diagnosed with diabetes, particularly to avoid dangerous blood sugar extremes, they are not very useful as standalone diagnostic tools for those who haven't been diagnosed with diabetes type 1 or 2. If you are concerned about your blood sugar reading, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider for proper testing and guidance.*  \nReference: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505415/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505415/)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q. Can I give or ask for medical advice in this subreddit?*****Answer:*** *It is not advisable to give or seek medical advice in this subreddit. While sharing experiences and information is encouraged, medical advice should always come from a qualified healthcare professional who understands your specific condition. Discussions here can provide support and share general knowledge, but they are not a substitute for professional medical consultation.

        "body": "Quite a bit here, I have enough time for the 1st paragraph:\n\n\\*\\*Q. What is pre-diabetes and how does it differ from diabetes?\\*\\*Answer: Pre-diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. The American ADA has a significantly lower cutoff for the diagnosis compared to the WHO, which has declined to adopt the lowered threshold suggested by the ADA over a decade ago.\n\nPrediabetes, with difficulty, can be distinguished from hyperglycemia, Metabolic Syndrome and other states with elevated glucose. For example, hyperglycemia may occur due to physiologic states that raise glucose but not predispose one to diabetes. Most, but not all prediabetes is due to persistent Insulin Resistance (IR) when found with Metabolic Syndrome. In this case, the risk of Prediabetes is not simply the subsequent risk of diabetes, but hyperlipidemia. Sometimes prediabetes is caused by a poorly secreting pancreas or incretins of the intestine.\n\nPrediabetes arising from IR is on a disease continuum with diabetes, in spite of a sharp numeric cutoff. The theoretical inflection point of diabetes occurs when even extremely high insulin levels are unable to suppress post meal fluctuations of glucose. Both can be managed and even reversed with lifestyle changes but with increasing difficulty with the passage of time. Body composition, the ratio of visceral fat to lean body mass (muscle) has been found to be pivotal for most cases of prediabetes.\n\nPrediabetes/diabetes cutoff was historically created with a small number of study patients noted to have an increased number of visibly damaged blood vessels in the back of the eye.\n\nEven though hyperglycemia is the most commonly measured index for prediabetes and diabetes, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation contribute to the disease course.",

Can I be diagnosed with pre-diabetes even if I am not overweight?\\*\\*Answer: Yes, while being overweight is a risk factor for pre-diabetes, many other factors place one at risk for future diabetes. The road to diabetes is complex and involves multiple defects: damage to cell structures by sugars, chronic inflammation, β-cell failure (decreased insulin secretion); insulin resistance in muscle, brain, and liver; increased glucagon secretion in pancreatic α-cells; increased lipolysis in adipose tissue; incretin deficiency and resistance in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; and increased glucose reabsorption in the kidney. \\[DeFronzo RA: Banting lecture: From the triumvirate to the ominous octet: a new paradigm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        "body": "What are the medical indicators that determine if I'm pre-diabetic?\\*\\*Answer: \\*Pre-diabetes is typically diagnosed based directly using blood sugar levels or indirectly, with the Hemoglobin A1c. Key indicators include an A1C level between 5.7% and 6.4%, overnight fasting blood sugar (FBS) results from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L), or an oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) showing 2-hour blood sugar levels between 140 and 199 mg/dL (\\*7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) after drinking a sugary drink.\n\nThe FBS is considered a measure of the liver's ability to regulate blood glucose during a fasting state. When combined with measurement of insulin levels, a measure of the liver's IR can be calculated with the HOMA-IR calculator. Only in the US, and those adopting the ADA standard, 100 mg/dL is the lower cutoff. The World Health Organization has steadfastly held 110 mg/dL to be the prediabetic cutoff. Therefore it is possible to be prediabetic in one part of the world, but not elsewhere. \n\nThe FBS test demonstrates marked physiologic, daily variation. Not uncommonly, poor sleep, activity prior to blood draw, vigorous exercise and illness can elevate the result.\n\nThe 2-hr GTT is considered the most predictive of future diabetes risk. The inability of insulin to tamp down glucose levels by 120 minutes reflects poor insulin secreting ability, or pancreatic exhaustion. The 2-hour test involves prolonged testing with multiple blood draws. For this reason, the A1c has gained favor as the most convenient screening test.  When the GTT is coupled with simultaneous insulin measurements, the Matsuda Index can be calculated, a measurement of whole body insulin resistance.\n\nThe GTT is a more reliable and reproducible test. However very low carbohydrate and keto diets will adversely affect the outcome of the results. The sugar content in the drink and timing differs between screening tests used during pregnancy and the standard GTT. \n\nApproximately one-third of prediabetics will be positive by one of these tests. With worsening metabolism, the other tests will become positive over time. Many who make diet and lifestyle changes experience no worsening or even improvement in later years.",

According to the ADA, for prediabetes, the A1C range falls between 5.7% and 6.4%. An A1c level below 5.7% is considered normal, while an A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests \\*may\\* indicate diabetes. \n\nWhile two general A1c tests are approved by the FDA, only one type is certified for rendering a diabetic diagnosis. Since the percentage reflects the percentage of Hemoglobin A which has sugar attachment, (glycation), the test is: 1) a stand-in proxy for average glucose values; 2) is subject to variability which prolong or decrease red cell survival; and 3) dependent upon normal, stable hemoglobin and glycation rates. Average CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) values do not exactly correspond to A1c equivalents for a variety of technical reasons.\n\nHemoglobin A1c has replaced the Fasting blood sugar (FBS), and 2-hour glucose tolerance test for ease of testing. Oftentimes it is possible to be positive early-on for prediabetes by one but not the other two tests. These tests measure different aspects of the body's ability to handle glucose.  The Gold Standard remains the 2-hour Glucose Tolerance Test, especially the 2-hour value after a 75 gram dextrose challenge. \n\nWhenever you have a reading of over 5.x (your physician is best to determine the value of concern), it is important to make lifestyle changes and get successive A1c tests spaced six months apart to establish trending (staying the same or going up/down).",

At that time, I gained freshman 20 in less than a semester. I look back at what I was eating and yikes. I was having frappes and lattes everyday with pastries. I would have a juice or a soda with every meal I was eating. I had desserts and all sorts of fried foods. Honestly, it's no wonder I became prediabetic. During the summer, I saw a Tiktok talking about how prediabetes should be treated more aggressively, and it got me a bit scared. So I decided to get do an at home kit A1C test. I found out I was 6.3 in August. Looking back, it was probably higher, seeing as many at home kit A1c tests are not accurate. I went down a rabbit hole on diabetic complications  and I started getting really anxious. I ended up finding this subreddit which gave a lot of great advice. \n\nSo what did I do?\n\nI think weight loss had the biggest impact. I lost about 20 pounds. I also incorporated walking after every meal for at least 10 minutes.  For my meals, I stopped drinking sodas and juices and switched to whole grain options such as brown rice and whole wheat bread. Every now and then, I would indulge in an energy drink or a diet soda. I increased my amount of fiber and I ate in a specific order, fiber, protein, and lastly carbs. This is a bit controversial in this subreddit, but I also did intermittent fasting. I would fast for at least 18 hours and then eat. \n\nI'm going to be honest, I had quite a number of cheat days. Every now and then I would indulge in some pastries or french fries (my guilty pleasure). Also, my culture loves rice, so I didn't cut that out entirely either :) but my overall diet and portion control had significantly changed. Now, I just need to maintain my levels.\n\nI wish everyone the best of luck on their own journeys :) !",

        "body": "\"a vegetable that contains a higher amount of starch (a type of complex carbohydrate) and **calories**\"\n\nOne thing I'll point out, though: potatoes are marvelously **low** in calories, yet hands-down the HIGHEST in \"satiety\" (they satisfy/make you feel full). Of course, that changes when they are loaded up with saturated fats (butter... sour cream... cheese...), but on their own, whole and unprocessed, they are fantastically healthy. And you are correct that carbohydrates are improperly demonized. You and I will be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, so be prepared. \n\nI have come to truly love a (close to) whole food, plant based diet. My tastes have actually changed, and I \\*CRAVE\\* healthier, unprocessed foods with much less fat, salt, and sugar. Sweets taste too sweet, now. My pancreas has recovered a bit - I am less insulin-resistant. For example, the pasta that I had earlier today (with a DELICIOUS, simple, fresh tomato sauce) barely moved the needle. \n\nAvoiding \"carbs\" and then claiming the problem is resolved is like turning off the water on a leaking sink and claiming the problem is solved: \"I just won't use that sink\".  We are designed to eat grains, vegetables, and fruits; when we don't, the problem can, in fact, become WORSE (and the reasons why are many). Whereas I can now eat a big fat steamed potato or a plate of pasta without incident, if I had been doing low-carb, I would spike to high heaven if I even LOOKED at those things. The first-phase release of insulin (which is insulin kept on-reserve for the next meal) won't be able to handle \"a carb\" if it has been trained never to expect any... There's a reason the experts recommend BALANCE.",

That scared me enough to actually do something about it.\n\nI made diet changes and started walking daily but the cravings were making everything way harder than it needed to be, especially in the afternoon and evening when my blood sugar would drop and I'd want to eat everything in sight, so I decided to try some supplements specifically for blood sugar management and appetite control.\n\nI tested these three over about 9 months total (12 weeks each):\n\nGlucocontrol: Berberine based supplement that's supposed to help with blood sugar. It cost around $45 a month. Honestly I didn't notice much difference in cravings or energy levels, maybe helped a tiny bit with blood sugar but hard to tell since I was also changing my diet. Stopped taking it after 12 weeks because it wasn't worth the cost.\n\nMuniq shake: Fiber based meal replacement shake. About $80 a month which felt really expensive. Tasted okay, did help with fullness for a few hours but the sugar cravings were still intense. I also got tired of drinking shakes instead of eating real food. The fullness wore off pretty quick and then I'd be starving again.\n\nOzzi drink mix: Konjac fiber and chromium supplement specifically for cravings. Around $70 a month. This one actually made a noticeable difference for me, the afternoon crashes are way less intense and evening snacking urge is manageable now instead of overwhelming. But as I said I’m not the biggest fan of just drinking stuff, so I’m a bit torn on this one.\n\nMy honest take is that supplements alone won't fix prediabetes, you still have to eat better and exercise (obviously). But having something that makes the cravings less intense makes it a bit easier to actually stick to the lifestyle changes. The first two I tried didn't really help much but the third one has been solid for managing the mental battle with food.\n\nBut at the end of the day everyone’s different so you’ll have to see what works for you",

Eating as much as I can, all healthy stuff.)  Pay particular attention to the last paragraph:\n\n\"A **starchy vegetable** is a vegetable that contains a higher amount of starch (a type of complex carbohydrate) and calories compared to non-starchy vegetables. They provide energy and are excellent sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. \n\nCommon examples of starchy vegetables include:\n\n* **Potatoes** (white and sweet varieties)\n* **Corn**\n* **Peas** (green peas and lima beans)\n* **Winter Squashes** (acorn, butternut, and pumpkin)\n* **Legumes** (dried beans, lentils, and chickpeas are often grouped with starchy vegetables in dietary guidelines)\n* **Root vegetables** like yams, parsnips, and cassava \n\nWhile healthy, starchy vegetables have a greater impact on blood sugar levels than non-starchy vegetables due to their higher carbohydrate content.

And see a dietician and do whatever they say.  The bot was much more concerned about my HOMA-IR score than my A1C and heartily endorsed early time restricted eating and exercise, both aerobic and resistance type.  It suggested a high protien meal right after resistance exercise.   It siezed on the fact that my grandmother got diabetes in old age, and was also tall and skinny like me, as evidence of a genetic predisposition to non-obese insulin resistance and said that was a high risk factor for diabetes and CV disease.\n\nSo, talk to Google AI and lay out all the facts, including the advice your considering and the anxieties you have about it, along with any relevant background info.   Of course, you never rely on a bot without getting authoritative corroboration.   But, it's interesting and nothing beats a bot for patient listening.   It also churns out lots of links to relevant scientific articles as a sidebar to the conversation you're having.,",

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic in October 2024 with A1C at 5.7. I kinda ignored it and didn't take it seriously. Did another blood test as part of routine annual exam in May 2025 and my A1C was at 5.9. That concerned me and I started making some changes to my lifestyle. \n\nI wanted to make lifestyle changes instead of making changes that I can't stick to. \n\nI got 3 months supply of Stelo CGM and started monitoring how my body reacts to food I eat. Reduced carbs (missed rice :-() and increased protein intake. Use apps like Cronometer, GlucospikeAI to keep track of what I am eating and macro nutrients. \n\nNot a gym person but started hitting gym about 2-3 times a week doing strength training. There are weeks where I was not consistent. :-( but pushed myself to go to gym. If I can get to the gym, I really enjoyed the workout and how my body felt afterwards but its the fact that I needed to get off the couch which was a problem. \n\nTried to sleep better but failed miserably because of my non-stop work travel. I sleep well when I am home which is about 50% of the time. \n\nWas able to manage stress overall. \n\nHere is the bad part - As far as food good, I ended up taking too much nuts such as almonds, walnuts and cashews. I also had avacado almost everyday. \n\nI did a blood test this week, the good news is that my A1c is at 5.3!!  Yay!! But my LDL, non-hdl cholesterol, total cholesterol shot up. Interestingly, my HDL is all time high as well.   \n  \nMet with my doc this morning - she mentioned that my ASCVD (cardiac) risk score has increased and its at 5. Never heard of this before. She advised me to adjust my diet to keep ldl and cholesterol in control. Recommended to do another blood work in 3 months to see where I stand - she mentioned if the ldl and total cholesterol come back in range, she will have to prescribe cholesterol medication - which I am not a big fan of. \n\nLooks like I need to start thinking about moderation of my cholesterol intake. \n\nSharing as others could benefit from my experience. Will report back in months. \n\n\n\n",

In the absence of carbs, your cortisol levels will be high, which may also keep your glucose levels up.  And, it's the combo effect of protein + carbs that will help you gain those muscles.\n\nKeep up the good work!",

The expert guidance is balance.  Total avoidance is only for white bread, sugar, transfats and highly processed foods. \n\nIf you go on a statin, ask for Pravastatin.  It is the only one that does not raise blood sugar.  \n\nConsider \"early time restricted eating. \".  It is supposed to be great for reducing insulin resistance.  It means no food after 3 pm.  Sounds terrible but I'm loving it, except for the weight loss. The bot advised me to add olive oil and/or nut butters and/or full fat dairy to a lot of things to pack in the calories.

Anyways it's gotten better but when they checked my fasting blood sugar, (i had crippling anxiety, like bpm reaching 130s, + got like 2 hours of sleep), it was 117. Just to rule out prediabetes, they did an A1c, and it came back at a 5.1. The other day, they checked blood sugar again in urgent care for some other reasons, it was a 105 (had lunch 4 hours before (50 g of refined carbs), + was drinking full sugar liquid iv before checking). Today morning, i decided to check my fasting again (around 45 mins after waking up) , and it was 112?? Huh?? I'm so confused. I tested again 2 times, and each time it went down by like 4 till it reached 104. And then I ate brunch which was pita bread, falafal, grilled veggies, and like 1/3 cup rice, and checked 2 hours later and the glucometer said my blood sugar was 117.

        "body": "First, no need to panic, and no need to get rid of your glucometer. What you’re seeing can happen from anxiety, poor sleep etc. All of those can raise fasting glucose temporarily because of cortisol and adrenaline. Your A1C of 5.1 shows your overall average is completely normal.\n\nWhat I would suggest is to monitor your fasting glucose and your post-meal numbers over the next couple of weeks. Avoid sugar and refined carbs so you can see what your true baseline is without noise. Wait for 30 minutes before checking. In someone with normal glucose regulation, fasting is usually under 100. So you may be borderline prediabetic, or this could simply be stress-related.\n\nIf your numbers still run high once your stress settles and sleep improves, then a lifestyle shift helps a lot. That means resistance training 3 days a week to build muscle, and fasted cardio 5 days a week if you can manage it. Muscle improves glucose handling even without insulin, and consistent activity brings fasting numbers down quickly.",

Fasting glucose runs high because of hepatic insulin resistance. That means the liver can’t “hear” insulin, so it never gets the signal to stop releasing glucose. It keeps breaking down glycogen and making new glucose as if the body were in a low-insulin, fasting state, and hormones like cortisol and glucagon push this even more. The most common drivers are alcohol and saturated fats in the diet. So yes, you are likely in the prediabetic range, but it’s completely fixable. \n\nI’m 57, diagnosed at 50, and I put mine into remission. You have plenty of time.

    "selftext": "I’ve been tracking my meals and noticed unexpected blood sugar spikes from foods like flavored yogurt, protein bars, or “sugar-free” snacks. Turns out, they often contain hidden sugars such as maltose, dextrose, and even sugar alcohols like maltitol and sorbitol. For those with prediabetes, these hidden carbs can make glucose management much harder.\n\nTips that helped me:\n\n* Read the ingredient list closely for names ending in -ose (like glucose, sucrose, fructose), syrups, nectar, concentrates, sugar alcohols (erythritol, xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol), maltodextrin, and common artificial sweeteners (sucralose, aspartame, saccharin).\n* Pick whole foods with fewer ingredients.\n* Add fiber to meals since it slows glucose absorption.\n* Pair carbs with protein or fat.\n* “Sugar-free” doesn’t always mean safe—sugar alcohols can spike some people and cause other issues.\n\nHave you noticed any foods that spiked your glucose even when labeled healthy? What swaps or habits have helped you avoid them?\n\n*For anyone interested in a more detailed breakdown, I wrote a longer article here:*  \n[https://buttondown.com/beat-the-spike/archive/hidden-sugars-the-sneaky-spikers-in-your-healthy/](https://buttondown.com/beat-the-spike/archive/hidden-sugars-the-sneaky-spikers-in-your-healthy/)",

I also have an endocrinologist who just did bloodwork, which I thought would include A1C, but did not. However, my glucose level came back at 98, within a normal range of 65-139. \n\nDoes that mean I am no longer in a prediabetes place? Or is the glucose result meaningless, and I need to contact my PCP and have further bloodwork? \n\nThank you from the panic zone. ",

        "body": "Prediabetes is defined by the American Diabetes Assn as EITHER A1C of 5.7t0 6.4, OR fasting glucose over 100 OR a certain result on a glucose tolerance test.    Any one of the 3 makes you prediabetic by their definition.    The definition is arbitrary and recent; it's different in other countries.   There was no such disease 20 years ago.  But it's a good wakeup call to start doing something about your glucose control.\n\nSo, fasting glucose isn't meaningless.   But it being in the green doesn't mean you are not prediabetic.  Either of the other 2 indicators could mean you are prediabetic.  And you can be okay on all three and still have insulin resistance, which I'll explain later.\n\nA1C is a rough guide to your average glucose level.  Fasting glucose is how low your glucose goes when there's no food feeding glucose into the blood stream.   And the glucose tolerance test is how well your body brings glucose back down when hit with a big glucose challenge.    Any one of the three could be off while the other two are okay.   Your body is always trying to keep glucose within a certain range, producing insulin to try to force glucose into the muscles, fat and liver when glucose in the blood is high.  \n\nAnother good thing to test is fasting insulin.   You can have acceptable glucose numbers and still not be totally healthy in the glucose department if you are achieving those low glucose numbers by overproducing insulin.  Get a fasting glucose and a fasting insulin on the same blood sample and check for insulin resistance by plugging those two numbers into a HOMA-IR calculator (google it).   i got my A1C down to 5.6 but then found out my HOMA-IR score is 4.8 which is bad.  Should be 2.9 or under and ideally close to 1.0.   I have some work to do!\n\nFasting insulin gives a baseline as to how high your insulin is when there is no glucose challenge from food recently (mine is 22.7 -- way too high).  HOMA-IR is based on multiplying fasting insulin by fasting glucose and dividing  by a constant, so it is getting at how much insulin it took your body to hold your glucose down to the level seen in the blood sample.  See [https://www.nesaz.com/understanding-your-insulin-resistance-score-homa-ir-score/](https://www.nesaz.com/understanding-your-insulin-resistance-score-homa-ir-score/)   If insulin demand is chronically high, that's bad.",

For example, what I thought was a super healthy meal of oatmeal and fruit every day actually caused such a severe spike compared to potatoes, bacon, and avocado. Therefore, i've severely limited oats and incorporated a more savory breakfast without the calories or spikes. Plus you can see what affects your body specifically, like for me, sweet potatoes are negligible, and they've now become my favorite food.  \n\nI signed up for Stelo Dexcom's subscription service off their website for 3 months and then after deciding I wanted to keep  using CGM  long term I bought the sensors off ebay for 1/3 cost. I've never had issues with any sensors, though, and I would hope that if I would call about a non working sensor stello would honor it because they don't know where I bought it from but i'm not sure.  \n\nI'm going to at least wear these monitors for another six months until I can figure out how to get my prediabetes glucose in control, which is not currently in control even though taking Jardiance and metformin.",

    "selftext": "Background Info:\n\nI am a 40 year old female who has had borderline high fasting blood sugar numbers since early 20's (anywhere between 100 and 120).  I also have had borderline high A1C readings every 6 months (ranging from 5.5 to 6.0) since 2019 when my doctor started drawing my A1C.  I also had gestational diabetes that I controlled with diet (I don't think it was actually gestational-I think it is just my normal high blood sugar).\n\nI am 5'5\" and weight 115 pounds (naturally small framed person, not underweight).  I do resistance training 4 times a week and slow run or walk another 2-3 times per week.  I get 8,000 to 10,000 steps on other days.  I follow a fairly healthy, but not perfect, diet and live a fairly low stress life.\n\nI decided this was the year I am going to figure out what is going on with my body so I started wearing a Lingo CGM.  I have learned that any sort of carbs, even healthy ones, spike my blood sugar (think chickpeas, sprouted grain bread, etc), as well as distance running and things like hot showers.  Unhealthy carbs (pasta, pizza, rice, French fries) put be more 200 and will keep me elevated above 140 for hours.  Based on this and my other readings I asked my primary for a referral to endocrinology.  I saw the doctor and she dismissed my request to draw insulin and c-peptides (not sure how I feel about this) and sent me for a 2 hr GTT to see if metformin might be a good option.  I was wearing my Lingo when I I did this.\n\n  \nGTT Results (also including Lingo readings):\n\nFasting: 105 (blood draw); 96 (lingo); 116 (finger prick - the lab tech said she thinks her finger prick machine was running high)\n\n1 hr: no blood draw; &gt;200 (lingo)\n\n2 hr: 104 (blood draw); 135 (lingo - but admittedly was spiking up and down at this time, Lingo didn't show a 104 reading until 3 hours after testing)\n\nSo a few questions - has anybody \"passed\" a GTT test with borderline A1C - mine was 5.7 in October?  Thoughts on the huge difference between the Lingo and blood draw at 2 hours when the fasting reading was more consistent?   Where would you go from here?  I did send the doctor my Lingo chart from yesterday after she messaged me questioning my 2 hour result.  \n\n  \n",

Even though my fasting readings were sometimes on the higher side around 98 I managed to bring them down to about 80–88. If I ate late at night, my morning fasting numbers would be around 100–108. I still spike easily from sugary foods, though; I’ve gone up to 190 just from eating Chinese takeaway. It sometimes can take 3-4 hours for my blood sugar to go down to baseline if it has a lot of carbs, yesterday I had 4 dates after dinner(dinner was protein rich) and it took 4 hours to go back to baseline \n\nYesterday, I had an OGTT done, and they also measured my fasting insulin, C-peptide, and A1c. Surprisingly, my A1c came back at 5.0 this time, with fasting insulin at 5.1 and C-peptide at 1.6. Which I guess puts my homa IR at 1? \n\nWhen they checked my blood sugar with a finger-prick, it read 78 (I woke up at 88, but I walked 15 minutes to the lab, which probably lowered it). The lab draw showed 70. After the 2 hour test, the finger-prick showed 130, but the blood sample came back as 111.

        "body": "Your OGTT is going to be the most accurate indicator for insulin resistance.\n\nA1c is going to be a little less reliable because it's only measuring an effect of insulin resistance (sustained elevated glucose) without a relationship to insulin (OGTT by comparison is measuring insulin response in relation to glucose level and uptake). A1c has a margin of error as well, and medications or other health conditions can affect your results.\n\nA1c can change in a short period of time because the value provided weights your most recent glucose levels over glucose levels in the later part of the 3-month period. This is due to how red blood cells turn over in the body and other technical stuff that's beyond my HS level of biology education. \n\nAlso, the margin of error inherent w/ a1c tests can be a factor when comparing 2 results. I have read that a1c margin of error can be up to .5%, but the way studies define \"margin of error\" isn't the same, so .5% may be an uncommon worst-case scenario.\n\nHOMA is a good indicator but has caveats and pitfalls. Since it's using a single glucose and insulin draw and those levels can/constantly fluctuate. Usually HOMA isn't used as a primary test for IR. HOMA is also less reliable when insulin and glucose levels are in (or close to) normal ranges.\n\nC-peptide is usually used to determine if your beta cells are functioning correctly and if your abnormal glucose levels are due to insulin resistance, insulin insufficiency, or both.\n\nGenerally speaking, OGTT is often considered second most reliable (gold standard is the insulin clamp which is complex and not really used outside of research) as it's measuring all aspects of identifying insulin resistance (glucose uptake over time in relation to insulin response) so you're probably safe in going by that result alone.\n\nThe main caveats with OGTT is it is not 100% reliable in identifying peripheral/whole body insulin resistance (for example, you may have insulin resistance in the liver that affects cholesterol production but may not present in glucose levels), and your results can be skewed by a transitory case of insulin resistance (ie not getting enough sleep the night before can induce a short period of IR that normally resolves quickly).",

I got it at first because I can get very tired after meals, and I was curious if this correlated to blood glucose spikes -- it doesn't look like it.  But my blood sugar A1c has been rising, and it looks like this may in part be that whatever I do in the last few hours before bed may have a big impact on my sleeping blood glucose levels --- something I would never know with finger pricks.",

        "body": "A spike isn’t always bad, but frequent or sharp ones can be a red flag. Aim to stay below 140 mg/dL, and ideally within +30 mg/dL of your baseline after meals. A slow rise under 115 with gentle curves usually means your body is handling the meal well. Fast rises (like 30+ mg/dL in 30 min) often suggest the meal needs more fiber, fat, or protein. Multiple peaks might mean slow digestion or frequent snacking.\n\nYou can try the Glucospike AI app to scan meals, see predicted spikes, and get quick suggestions to balance them. Then go for a walk about 20 minutes after eating. Check your CGM and see how that combo affects your spike. That feedback loop builds awareness fast and helps you make better food choices without guessing.",

I’ve been experimenting with different foods and it seems like no matter what I eat I don’t go over 120 at most.

A slice of banana bread for instance, which is basically just straight carbs with some fat, had no measurable impact on my blood glucose at all.

I have occassionally checked my blood sugar to confirm a spike, then keep checking to make sure my glucose levels fall back down (\\~100) about 1-2hr later, which tells me I have a delayed insulin response. I cannot wear a CGM because I developed an adhesive allergy during my first pregnancy.\n\n  \nMy primary care doctor says she isn't concerned and would not consider me to be in the prediabetic category, but I know something is abnormal about my metabolic health so I've scheduled an endocronologist appointment myself (first available appt is in Feb 2026).\n\n  \nI am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience as I've love to get some inspiration and learn from this community on ways to prevent full-blown diabetes.

I work out intensely 4 times a week, hardly drink, I don't smoke and somehow I'm prediabetic at 42mmol/Mol (I'm from the UK) or 6% for the rest of the world. \n\nTimeline: back in 2021 my blood sugar was checked in a routine test and it came back as 42 (6%). The doctor didn't even tell me so I didn't even know. Fast forward 4 years to early 2025, I took a routine blood test, came back again as 42 (6%) and this time it was flagged up with a text message that almost made me crash out. I just saw \"diabetes\" and freaked out. After speaking with the doc I then went on a 6 month change, I cut out all juice drinks except for the weekends, having maybe a glass or two of cranberry juice with limes on a night out (I don't drink much alcohol if at all). I dropped all cheat meals with cakes and sweet items to just one \"cheat day\".\n\nI lost a tiny bit of weight. I leaned out more. I felt good. Went back in after 6 months for another test aaannd...still 42 (6%). WTF?!\n\nAny of you have poorly designed bodies like this too? :(\n\np.s posted on a burner so I can focus solely on this sub haha",

        "body": "You might want to look into something called MODY (**Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young)**. It’s a genetic form of diabetes that has nothing to do with lifestyle, body fat, or how clean you eat. People with MODY are often lean and active and look like the last people you’d expect to have glucose issues. It’s caused by a single gene mutation that affects how the pancreas releases insulin, so cutting sugar or losing weight usually doesn’t change the A1c.\n\nA few things in your story fit the pattern a lot of MODY people describe:  \n• A1c sitting at the exact same number for years no matter what you do  \n• Lean, muscular, not showing insulin resistance  \n• Very steady glucose profile but slightly elevated overall  \n• Family members with “borderline diabetes” or weird glucose issues that never fit type 1 or type 2\n\nThere are several MODY types, and each one behaves a little differently:\n\nMODY 2 (GCK)  \nThis one is super common. It basically shifts your “glucose thermostat” a bit higher from birth. Your fasting glucose and A1c stay stable your whole life, even if you eat perfectly. Most people with this type don’t need treatment and never progress.\n\nMODY 1 (HNF4A)  \nPeople with this subtype often have normal glucose when younger but develop higher sugars in their 20s or 30s. They’re very sensitive to certain low-dose meds and usually don’t need insulin early on.\n\nMODY 3 (HNF1A)  \nSimilar to MODY 1 but tends to show up a bit earlier. These folks respond strongly to small doses of sulfonylureas. Often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2.\n\nThere are rarer types too, but these three cover most cases.\n\nIf your doctor is open to it, you can ask about testing for MODY or a simple genetic panel. A lot of people spend years thinking they’re prediabetic when it’s actually a stable genetic pattern they were born with. Just something to rule out, especially since your number hasn’t moved at all despite changing your lifestyle.",

While 6 isn’t the best, it might not be that bad. If you get a glucose monitor (either the finger prick or even better a CGM), you can figure out what your glucose levels are actually doing. My understanding is anything under 140 (sorry, you’ll need to convert to UK units) is safe. Brief spikes above that with meals are normal and fine. Any meal should raise your glucose some. Exercise will likely raise your glucose but hopefully not over 140. It’s possible that your glucose levels are high but still in the safe range throughout the day.‘\n\nYou mentioned cutting out juices and cakes which are obvious sources of sugar. However it’s really all sources of carbohydrates, not just sugar, that you need to reduce. A good starting point is to limit meals to 50g of carbs and snacks to 20g. \n\nThe glucose monitor can help you identify specific foods that may spike you worse than others. For me, rice is the worst followed by wheat and strangely corn causes the fewest problems.\n\nIf diet change doesn’t work, you could consider going on a low dosage of metformin. I ended up doing that and it’s made the biggest difference. My fasting glucose dropped from 100 to 85. I still maintain a low carb diet and mostly restrict my cheat meals to in the middle of long exercise like bike rides or hikes where the exercise will keep my glucose under control.\n\nRemember that a pre-diabetes diagnosis is a wake up call, not the end of the world.",

So stay incredibly hydrated. \n\nUse the largest amount of muscles in your body which tends to be the legs, namely the quads, but even having the calve muscles flex together with quads helps which makes sense that walking mostly helps. Standing lunges or squats in sets of 10-12 helps. Pushups, jumping jacks, ect. Your muscles will help shuttle the blood glucose from your blood into your cells to be used for energy. So move. Even vacuuming and doing chores will help. \n\nIf time allows, after being active try some teas like chamomile or peppermint or even dandelion teas (all subtly help aid in calmer blood glucose and stress) with sprinkle of cinnamon and lemon (lemon is acidic like apple cider which also brings blood glucose down). \n\nSo hydrate, stay active, and then try to calm down (destress) after. This always helps. It’s like clockwork for me when I go overboard with the wrong foods.",

If your goal is to have a steady glucose levels there are several options to choose rather than focusing on fasting. Some people like to starve themselves, it makes them feel better. But if you’re not that type, then choose slow, releasing complex, carbs, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Now pair this with resistance training and fasted cardio in the morning. \n\nFasting eats away the muscles you have period. Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat, and increase increases metabolism. \n\nThere’s another concept that people don’t realize.

    "selftext": "Hey folks, thanks for this great community of resources. Just wanted to share my experience (much of which has been mentioned at various times).  \n  \nFirst, if you're prediabetic, get an annual eye exam. 2 months ago, I got my first eye exam since 2019, and I was told that I had some retinopathy. Because I hadn't had an exam for so long, it's impossible to say if this is a recent development, or something that happened during the pandemic when my A1c went up to 6.1. Since 2019, I've typically fluctuated between 5.7-5.9 in my A1c except during the pandemic when it went to 6.1. Because it was on the low end of prediabetic, I always figured that I was okay, but the eye exam told me otherwise.  \n  \nOnce I got a Continuous Glucose Monitor, I could see what was going on. During intermittent fasting periods (typically 10pm-12noon), my blood sugar would be low,  sometimes too low (occasionally below 70). Then I would rapidly eat a lot and my BG would spike sharply (up to 174 once during Afternoon Tea) and then drop sharply. There seem to be mixed opinions, but I've been reading that these sharp spikes are harmful even if they drop rapidly. \n\nI then took a break from IF, and my BG has been a lot steadier since then (note, this is in conjunction with changing my diet significantly so it wasn't just cutting out the IF). It still goes up and down but not nearly as sharply as previously.\n\nHowever, despite my improvement in avoiding the high spikes, my estimated A1c from the CGM graphs hasn't changed much--it's gone from 5.8 when I first started to 5.7. I am theorizing that when I was IF, my lows were extremely low and thus artificially depressed the A1c average so I never realized I was doing damage with my spikes. This is a where relying only on A1c can lead you astray. I'm really grateful for the CGM and wish I had started a long time ago. \n\nAfter cutting the obvious carbs (bread, cookies, etc) out of my diet, I'm finding it not too awful to keep my BG below 140. At some point, I'll experiment and see what carbs don't spike me (I haven't tried rice or potatoes yet because at first), but for now, I'm using the CGM to find what works.  \n  \nIf this is a permanently lifestyle change--I'm okay with it. Any condition that forces me to exercise more and eat more vegetables and fat is not the worst thing in the world. And thank goodness that prediabetes is something that we can exert control over. ",

Other conditions can cause it, and it seems sort of surprising that you had observable damage without having long term, sustained high blood sugar. One site I was reading indicated that even keeping blood sugar under 7 for diabetics will help decrease your risk, and you were way below that. \n\nI totally agree that people should have annual eye exams.  My own experience with over-the-counter CGM make me a little skeptical about how reliable they are, but it's certainly not going to hurt. \n\nIf one is likely to develop retinopathy in the pre-diabetic range, it would seem much more likely that we'd all move to medication to keep it lower.",

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed pre diabetic about 3 months ago after requesting my first diabetes test. My teeth have been going downhill for the last 4 or 5 years. My dentist kept asking if I was doing drugs. I’m now 52. I thought it was just old age lol. Anyway I had to switch dentist this year due to an insurance change. I had to wait a few months to get in with the new dentist  but when I began explaining what was happening with my teeth the first question the new dentist asked was if I was diabetic!! Scared me but things started making sense.\n\nMy feet have been hurting, burning, stinging and just feeling wrong for about a year and a half. Now it’s starting in my hands just recently since my diagnosis. And I’ve been trying to change my diet. But from reading on here I see I’ve made some mistakes!! (Syntha 6 protein powder, etc etc) I have lost 6 pounds though. Down to 188 from my heaviest weight ever 194. My weight since I was in my 30s was always 145-150 which is pushing it. I’m only 5’4”. But since I’ve started on antidepressants in the past few years I’ve been gaining weight. Even when coming off one to try another I’d gain 10 more pounds. When they added Auvelity to boost my antidepressant I gained 20 more.\n\nI made an appt for another a1c and fasting glucose test for last week as I’ve been reading on here it seemed like everyone was getting it rechecked every 3 months. When I showed up turns out it was a Dr appointment instead. They only redo the test every year for pre diabetics. But my a1c was 6 and my fasting glucose was 126. The 126 is diabetic range and my symptoms lead me to believe I am diabetic, even though the letter he sent me with my labs said I was pre diabetic. I told him I would like to be tested again. The dr said I probably have a vitamin deficiency B 12 or Iron causing my foot issues and a bit of carpel tunnel in my hands😡😡  my labs for those came back fine. A neurologist office called today to schedule the appointment for my nerve conduction study for February. Coincidentally I go back to the Dr in February a few days later for my a1c test. He said I could do a 6 month recheck of it😡😡\n\nAnyway here I am doing the best I can with no help from my Dr. except for the exercise part. As every time I’m up doing anything for more than 10 minutes I start sweating and continue to sweat until I can sit down and rest a bit. After explaining that to the Dr he asked me to keep a log of when it happens, what I’m doing etc. I told him everything over 10 minutes. Showering, doing dishes, getting my son ready for bed, everything!! Eeesh😵‍💫😵‍💫\n\nSo I’ve decided to try the Dexcom Stelo for a month. It’s $100 for 2 sensors on Amazon atm. It’s a bit pricey for me and I understand it may not be the correct numbers but I’m hoping I can at least learn what makes it go up and down or stay up or whatever I need to learn about how my food choices affect me. I honestly expected to lose more than 6 pounds over the last 3 months. My mom was actually diagnosed with diabetes a few weeks before I was diagnosed pre diabetic!! Weird coincidence or what!! And she’s said I could use her finger prick machine some for the next month. So I’ll have those numbers maybe a couple times a week. Are there certain times it would be better to take my numbers?? I can use it whenever I need to.\n\nAnd finally (sorry for my life story) I’ve read about the cgms needing covers. They only have one for each sensor in the box. What do I need to order with the Stelo?? \n\nThank you to anyone who reads this tldr!! I have a disabled son ( sleep and stress are things I cannot change) and 2 grand babies. I need to be in better health. Any help or advise at all would be so appreciated!!",

The Stelo has been incredibly useful to me because I joined a diabetes reversal program called Heald. My early graphs, would have looked perfectly normal if I didn't have that guidance to make sense of it from their nutritionist. \n\nCheck if your insurance covers a nutritionist. You can check out the program I joined since it's only 50 a month, cheaper than the Stelo. Over the course of the program I have added fiber before every meal. Had my last meal earlier. Stopped snacking (actually quite easy if you have enough fiber). This post is mine shows just how much of a difference just a little bit of focus on eating right will make: https://www.reddit.com/r/stelo/s/Gwcnzwdf2g\n\nI was always good about working out. I would suggest showing down. The key to distance is go slower. Biking and walking are both good ways to establish base fitness. You slow down enough and you can go a long time. Just keep going. Don't worry about being exerted. I've run marathons and the key is you go so slow that you get annoyed with yourself. It's slower than how slow you have to go to feel you can go forever.",

My lab work results had my A1C at 5.7 and and avg glucose of 117. \n   I’ve since been looking at carb/sugar amounts on what I buy, and am switching up my diet, avoiding pasta, white breads, etc. And this weekend I bought a home glucose monitor. \n   Yesterday afternoon, about four hours after breakfast, I tested at 104. First thing this morning, I got a result of 128! This was after 8 hours sleep.\n    I thought it was supposed to be lower after a night’s rest and now I’m confused and a little disheartened. \n   Is there something I’m not taking into account?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Still, I want to be cautious.\n\nIs there a way that this lab work could have been incorrect (maybe I didn’t fast long enough before this appointment, error on the lab’s part etc.)? Anyone been in this situation before?\n\nThere is of course the possibility that this is accurate, in which case, any advice? I’ll be honest about my sweet tooth/junk food habits and say I do eat some crap. Not too much, but more than I should. But rest assured I make sure to get my water, fruits, veggies, and proteins in!

By 140 mg/dl = 7.8 mmol/L, the point at which we traditionally only begin to classify patients as glucose intolerant or pre-diabetic, the risk is already increased by 58%\n\nThere are other health risks also from blood sugar spikes\n\nIf you watch a YouTube video entitled: Optimal Levels Understanding Blood Sugar Levels &amp; what should your levels be, on the Levels - Metabolic Health &amp; Blood Sugar Explained YouTube channel https://youtu.be/vZbgTzDxBFg?si=YpbfC_Z1yPyBYxBv , they say that research shows that the optimal levels to aim for are a post meal glucose peak of less than 110mg/dL / 6.1 mmol, and a post meal increase of less than 30mg per dL / 1.7 mmol.\n\nOn a YouTube short video entitled What should Your Fasting Glucose Level Be, Dr Robert Lustig says that FBS should optimally be 70-95mg/dL /3.9-4.7mmol , or sub-optimally maybe 70-90mg/dL. He states that blood sugar levels should not go above 110mg/dL 6.1 mmol after eating. He says that if your blood sugar level goes above 120mg/dL/6.7mmol &amp; turns around quickly, it’s not so bad. Ultimately, the goal is to get back to baseline within 90 minutes. Dr Lustig says that’s more important than how high it goes, because that’s the plateau.He doesn’t say whether the 90 minutes is from when you start eating or when your blood sugar peaks.",

This is, in my view, an imprecise way to characterize the data, and it conflates correlation and causation. It is inarguably true that higher post-meal blood glucose is correlated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. It seems reasonable that this relationship might exist even below the 'diabetes' threshold. \n\nBUT the cited data do NOT allow us to make causal claims, and you could imagine all sort of non-causal reasons that the observed correlations exist (diet, exercise, health education, access to healthcare, history of yo-yo dieting, etc...). Even though the 80 mg/dl number was taken verbatim from the cited paper, I don't see how such a cutoff is supported by the included data, and it is not consistent with lots of other papers, including some that it cites.",

I'm trying to get my schedule changed to accomadate this, actually. But I have to take the Metformin with food or else I get sick, and tbh I only ever manage to take two pills a day because I only have the time for two meals.  \nAnd then when it comes to food, I'm lactose intollerant AND partially allergic to seafood, but thankfully salmon is fine. \n\nI'm going to push myself to try and take walks in the morning but otherwise I'm at a loss  \nDue to my job I'm extremely sedentary, and I know that it's up to me to change that but this work schedule is getting in my way. \n\nCan't cook after work because as soon as I get off I have to go to bed, mornings are spent trying to feed myself and complete whatever chores or tasks I have to do before my shift starts. My go to meals have always been protein over rice beause it's something I can make fast, and now I'm making sure to cool my rice off to build up resistance starch and add lentils for extra fiber, but I know that's just a bandaid.\n\nFeeling really disheartened because every sort of food plan i read on either relies heavily on dairy for protein or for long cooking process for the vegetables. \n\nThat's not even to mention snacks for my meagre 15 minute breaks- I've resorted to eating fistfulls of plain baby carrots to try and get SOME fiber in where I can. \n\nIf anyone has any advice that would work with this sort of schedule I'd really appreciate it....... hoping to eventually find a good GP I can turn to for assistance with the pre-diabetes, since my Gyno is mainly focused on the PCOS, but that hasn't worked out so far.

I just want to lose the pounds, get my blood sugar in order, keep it off, and stay healthy. I don’t want to end up diabetic and on the same road that my family has. Thank you to anyone that took a moment to read this. ",

I made a lot of lifestyle changes which took sacrifice but I did it in a sustainable way, meaning I made changes that I could keep for the long term. A lot of people go on extreme diets and exercise plans and suffer burn out and cannot keep it up, so be wary of this.\n\nThe short summary is eating more fibre, greatly reducing processed food/sugars and creating a calorie deficit.

        "body": "Ugh you’re going to get so much conflicting advice! \n\nThere are lots of different options that can be effective for managing your blood sugar: low carb, whole foods, keto, calorie counting, volume eating, intermittent fasting etc\n\nI think the least restrictive diet that actually works and that you enjoy is the best one. What that is varies for each individual but I would suggest looking into the Mediterranean diet Whatever you pick, don’t keep snacks or treats at home that aren’t aligned with your diet. Make treats soemthing special that you buy single serving as needed. When you do have one (occasionally), enjoy it all the way, guilt free, and then go back to your normal way of healthy eating. \n\nQuitting alcohol and weed are huge steps! Give yourself credit and work on your self-compassion and positive self-talk :) Being friendly to yourself will support you better than being unkind. \n\nSugar free sweeteners are a good step away from sugar but most of them are known to cause metabolic problems and don’t decrease diabetes risk relative to regular soda. When you’re ready, maybe try swapping some out for La Croix or spin drift or make a big pitcher of unsweetened ice tea. \n\nGoing with the idea of the least restrictive thing that is effective, I wouldn’t start counting calories if I were you. If you need to down the road, okay, but it’s a pain and I wouldn’t unless you absolutely need to. From here, improving your diet and quitting weed should help regulate your appetite. I would suggest practicing mindful eating! Only eat when you feel hungry - if you want to eat, make sure you are actually hungry, not bored, lonely, or stressed. When you eat, pay some attention to your food and really enjoy it, don’t eat mindlessly. Don’t eat while you’re doing work or driving. Try to slow down to your eating. Stop when you feel satisfied/no longer hungry, not stuffed. If improving your diet and mindfulness don’t get your weight going in the right direction after a few months, then you can think about counting calories, intermittent fasting, or other interventions, but no need to start there. \n\nThe glucose goddess also has good tips on managing blood sugar that are pretty doable. Starting meals with vegetables has helped me and it’s pretty easy to integrate a starter salad or just some crudite before most meals, or to eat the veg part of my meal first. \n\nThe best exercise is the one you’ll actually do… just like diet, this is about making long term changes so they need to work and feel good for you, not just be about will power. An ideal program includes cardio and strength exercises but just start with where you are. If the gym is overwhelming, get a fitness tracker and make a daily step goal and take walks. Or do YouTube fitness videos. Or go back to some sport you enjoyed as a kid or always wanted to try, like a rec soccer league or jujitsu. You can reevaluate in six months and decide if you want to add more or try different activities.",

I used to snack or drink milk too soon after eating, which led to spikes, and adjusting this made a big difference.\n•\t⁠Walking after meals is super helpful. I’ve been doing this consistently, and now my A1C is at 5.1.\n\nIt all boils down to insulin resistance. Instead of tracking calories, I started tracking which meals were spiking me with the glucospike AI app. That helped me see what was actually causing issues. Sometimes we guess a meal is “good,” but it’s not always the case.\n\nBy the way, you’re lucky you found out now. It’s the perfect time to fix a few things and build healthier insulin resistance and A1C. Don’t worry, it’s not the end of the world, just an obstacle. You’ll love all the new learnings ahead!",

Doctor gave me the news I was well into T2 but gave me three months to sort myself out and make some improvements.  Dropped to 6, then 5.7 to 5.3.  \n\nI had a Dexcom One + CGM for a few months to help me focus.  Didn’t have it on all the time.  As I Iost weight, felt better and saw improvements in the A1C I got cynical about the accuracy of the Dexcom device.  It was showing no real improvement.  I decided to get an Accucheck saw I could compare blood from the finger to the Dexcom.  It was way different even allowing for time lag.  I’m talking 3 mmol/l different.  \n\nI was given a Freestyle Libre 2 to try.  Closer but still different.  According to the Libre my blood glucose has been at 2.9 mmol/l for 30 minutes - no way.  Accucheck read 4.2.  I’d go with the Accucheck as I was out on a leisurely walk, felt great and full of energy.\n\nMy crappy hypothesis is that for the first couple of days the CGM is fine.  Post that the body heals and it starts to go off a little.  It also doesn’t handle situational changes eg exercise, contact with water, humidity etc.\n\nNote my wife, who has no history of blood glucose issues with great scores, received one for free as well.  Exactly the same.\n\nIs it just a poor user blaming the tools or is the finger prick the only real way.\n\nPS - I understand that some people rely on these much more than I do.",

I've noticed they're out a bit, e.g. maybe 0.4 or so either high or low, but relatively consistent throughout the life of the sensor.\n\nThe first 20 hours or so is pointless and all over the shop. Best advice is put the sensor on and only activate it the day after. I got significantly lower readings activating it straight away (2-3 mmol lower).\n\nThere is a good 15+ mins lag or so with CGMs due to how they measure, as it's reading institial fluid not the blood directly, so that needs to be considered when doing a comparison. Something 3 mmol out doesn't sound right though, has this happened multiple times or is it a dodgy sensor? \n\nI've not had many but I felt like maybe it was drifting a bit in a last couple of days of life. Probably to be expected as I guess this is the nature of the technology once your body starts to gunk up the sensor.\n\nBlood is best but the CGM is giving a lot more insight into patterns and behaviours rather than just the point in time, so depends on your aim with it as well.\n\nI don't think I've seen any issues with exercise or showering or anything.",

I was never notified by anyone\n\nWhen I finally messaged my clinic to ask about it, they replied saying they didn’t have any glucose tests on file. After that message, the blood test from my last visit disappeared from my MyChart. only my urine results are still visible. I know it was there before, and now it’s completely gone.\n\nI still have screenshots from past blood tests (from last year) showing similar high glucose levels that no one has ever mentioned to me.

If your Glucose is too high, it doesn’t correctly with all your symptoms which sound like low sugar.  If a smoothie made you feel better then that definitely sounds like low sugar.

The takeaway (as least from what I've gathered) is the leucine response is a similar effect as you get with refined carbs - it comes with regular excessive exposure.\n\nThe comment about insulin exposure &amp; desensitization happening in isolation comes mostly from Ralph Defronzo's work and some of the GLP-1 studies (glp-1's increase insulin response and reverse insulin resistance) but there are a lot of studies out there that cast doubt on this theory. Defronzo did 2 great interviews on Peter Attia's podcast and they're excellent - I highly recommend listening to them in order.\n\nAlso check out the Consensus site.

The program I joined is called Heald and I don't know if they're trying to train their AI to do all those or costs in India are just very cheap but they are 50 bucks a month out of pocket.

This time my insulin jumped from 3 to 230+ and stayed like that for almost an hour. To be honest its my mistake, cause the day before the test itself i had a bunch of sweets on an empty stomach and thats completely my fault. I need to ask on how do i like, learn to accept im very near diabetes and need to eat healthy? Because i genuinely cant. Im 16 and all of my peers eat unhealthy and its genuinely so tempting its insane. My parents try their hardest to eat properly when theyre with me but i see the candy wrappers in the trash. It all just makes me so angry. Why do I have to be the one that cant enjoy food like others? Nothing genuinely makes me happy anymore so unhealthy food just makes me forget about that for a minute. I hate it, my mom constantly makes me these healthy meals which i DESPISE: either awful/bland taste or horrid texture i cant describe. I have other health issues, i fit almost every criteria for PCOS and my insomnia has just been wrecking me for the last 2 years. I dont wanna pay a lot of money for healthy food, just for it to be mediocre. I wanna eat like everyone else but ill just get scolded at home. What the hell do i do? How do i approach this?

Treatment can help you lose weight too and may solve some of the insulin resistance problems.  The only other advice I can think of is, if you know you're going to slip up and eat some junk food, try to eat the bland vegetables and protein beforehand.

        "body": "I'm sorry you're going through this. I was diagnosed a few months back and had a difficult time processing it, too. Here are the points that helped me:\n\n\n1. About a week after my diagnosis I started thinking beyond the stereotypical chicken and broccoli meals.and figured out healthy dishes that were enjoyable. It sounds like your parents are supportive. Can you suggest a day every week or two where you cook with a parent to experiment with blood-sugar friendly meals? I go for stir fries with peanut sauce, shakshuka with homemade tomato sauce, almond-flour-based baked goods, and anything spicy. Use ChatGPT to take a flavor profile and turn it into a metabolically friendly entree. \n\n\n2. Take it one day at a time. It's rough to eat something unsatisfying and think \"this is my dinner for the next 80 years.\" It's easier to say \"this is for today.\" \n\n\n3. Keep in mind that you're young...while you may always be prone to insulin resistance, if you make big changes now, you may be able to relax in a few months once some insulin sensitivity has been restored. I've discovered after a few months of obsessive food tracking and exercise, I can eat carbs again and, as long as I take modest portions and exercise afterward, my blood sugar doesn't seem to spike. That isn't possible for everyone, but you may as well check to see if things improve after 3-6 months. \n\n\n4. Gamify it. I created a scorecard to track whether I was improving my A1C or not. It gave me a bit of dopamine at the end of each day when I saw if made it into the green and incentivized good habits. Here's a copy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSHQp1NsY_OvUmfxbNWcfJOFd9A88rijJO8Or4uAK1Q/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\n\n5. I know it's probably tiresome to hear this, so I'm sorry for harping back to it, but you're young, and life can change a lot. You said that nothing makes you happy anymore and unhealthy food helps you forget that. Well, ten years from now you may well be in a very different situation. If anything, this diagnosis may help you kickstart new habits, by forcing you to exercise, experiment in the kitchen, or meet new people that opens doors. You're in a bad place right now, but don't assume it'll always be stormy just because there are clouds now. (I say this as someone who had a rather miserable time in much of grade school myself.) \n\n\n6. Should have said this earlier, but walk or exercise after meals. It won't fix things by itself, but it helps a lot.\n\n\nGood luck!",

We like flavor! With that being said, PLEASE TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE FOODS! let me know what you enjoy! Your favorite hacks! Substitutes! Anything! I want to add more to My list of meals I can cook that are friendly! I’ve been making lettuce wraps lately with chicken, bell peppers, and avocados in everything but I need more recipes!!! Thank you ahead of time for any help I get, I really appreciate this being a Reddit group :)",

Eat vegetables and protein first and carbs last. So before the meal starts have a small salad or a side of broccoli. This creates a “cushion” for the carbs and helps you digest slower causing your body to release less insulin.",

There are a lot of ways to drive insulin resistance, and everyone has slightly different sensitivities.\n\nMy achilles heel is processed food. I have done keto, low carb, and good ol' fashioned \"healthy\" food. Nixing processed food (strict whole foods that results in approx 50% cals from healthy fats, 30% from protein, and 20% from net carbs with high fiber) has worked out best for me and gives me a lot of flexibility. I have a very hard time taking in more than a couple grams of starches and added sugars.\n\nAlso getting your weight down will make a huge difference. Extra adipose tissue is like a IR coefficient that's always turned on.\n\nSounds like you're on the right track with your diet.\n\nYou can also mitigate the effects of a cheat meal by drinking a fiber supplement or apple cider vinegar beforehand and going for a walk immediately after you finish eating. Volume makes a difference, too... try not to totally \"open the floodgates\" during a cheat meal. Get just enough to reward yourself for a having a good week and scratch the itch.",

Type 1 diabetes runs in my family and I've witnessed my father's struggles and later life complications. My blood sugar levels have been in normal range up until the last year or two. I was diagnosed with prediabetes in late August with 5.9 A1c, but ten weeks later I got my A1c down to 5.4 and dropped 14 pounds! Triglycerides went from 202 to 105. I'm feeling so much better although I understand that the changes I've made will have to continue for the rest of my life, and I need to get my weight down to 145 or better. \n\nI feel like my struggles were exacerbated by a bad case of Covid in October 2024. Since then, I've given in to terrible cravings for sugar in the forms of sugared soda, cereal and bakery. I feel like sugar became a beast in my gut always demanding to be fed. I was terrified when I was diagnosed with prediabetes. It explained some recent falling episodes when I must have been hypoglycemic but didn't know it. During the worst episode back in April, I was out walking my dog when I became disoriented and felt like I was sinking. I had to brace myself against a building not to fall. I got home and made myself some cinnamon/sugar toast and followed that with 3 homemade cookies and a ginger ale. I had no local doctor as I lived in a small town near the Mexico border. In June, I moved back to the midwest for better healthcare and I now have an excellent PCP. \n\nAfter my diagnosis, I re-read Sugar Crush by Richard Jacoby, then The Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes and Glucose Revolution by Jessie Inchauspe. I went cold-turkey off the sugared beverages and only drink water, coffee with milk and plain, hot tea. I stopped eating bratwurst and other junk at the ballpark and stuck with peanuts in the shell. Next, I started eating more salads and carrots and celery before each meal and cut out pastries and most bread, although I will still eat dark rye or heavily seeded bread on occasion. No junk or packaged, processed food. No snacks between meals and I stop eating by 6:00 pm. I plan my meals so that I walk my dog 20 to 30 minutes later, otherwise I do easy step exercises and light weights in front of the tv. I still eat ice cream every other week but trying to have that after a meal. These changes have been gradual and they have not been easy. Thanks for reading my saga. The journey continues...",

For now, I’d try not to worry too much about the doctor's label and instead focus on understanding your own body. Pay attention to what signs or changes you’re noticing. You might find these early warning signs helpful: [https://glucospike.ai/blog/early-warning-signs-of-prediabetes-what-to-watch-for-especially-if-it-runs-in-your-family](https://glucospike.ai/blog/early-warning-signs-of-prediabetes-what-to-watch-for-especially-if-it-runs-in-your-family).\n\nIt’s great that you’re staying on track with your lifestyle changes! Just a heads-up: hiking can sometimes raise blood sugar, especially if you do it on an empty stomach or with very little food, since your body may start producing more glucose for energy. You could try using a CGM or do a finger-prick test while hiking to see what happens. Also, I personally use the glucospike AI app to check if my meal is balanced or likely to spike my glucose, and it really helps me stay aware.",

Based on some people’s advice on here, today I went out and bought a blood glucose test kit (the finger prick kind). Not just because I want to make sure my dieting is actually working, but also b/c I just like data and think it’s cool to have data abt what my body is up to lol. \n\nI tested just now, about two hours after having an extremely carb-heavy lunch (to be exact, a Trader Joe’s noodle bowl with 51g carbs, 19g protein, and 23g fat). That’s exactly the kind of thing I’m trying to avoid, but it was in my freezer and I figured it would be an interesting test. I also basically did not move at all after eating (I sat on my couch and watched football). My blood glucose result was 93, which is basically the same as my fasting glucose (90). What does this mean as far as insulin resistance is concerned?",

At one point in high school, I had 2.4% body fat and I've always struggled to gain weight. I consistently get 7.5 - 8 hours of sleep every night.\n\nOver the past few years I have been experiencing serious bouts of fatigue and lethargy after meals. No matter my level of my regular physical activity, I'd always need to take a 20 minute nap -- which would result in waking up with anxiety and heart-pounding.\n\nI was attributing my fatigue to being \"too comfortable\" in life or depleting my dopamine from being online (even though I never spent more than 30-60 minutes online per day). My fatigue spells were always 60 - 90 minutes after each meal.\n\nIt wasn't until I had a footlong Subway sandwich that made me sleep for an hour and absolutely wrecked me the rest of the day. So I bought a Stelo and saw my fasting glucose was around 110. I immediately scheduled an appointment and found that my A1C is 5.6 -- right on the edge of prediabetes. But my doctor showed absolutely no concern for this.\n\nFor the few weeks after getting my A1C back, I started lifting and playing basketball 4 times per week and taking a walk after lunch and dinner to curb the spikes. I've eliminated the tiredness, but I'm still bouncing around 130 - 150 spikes, but always returning to what I was at before the meal. I was within the 70 - 140 range 96% - 97% each day, too.\n\nI changed to snacking on string cheese and nuts, eliminated cereal from breakfasts, and eat my veggies, meat, then carbs. My wife is also a nutritionist, so we've always been conscious of what we eat. I began to see a decrease in my average glucose after implementing these changes. I've also significantly reduced my sugar intake after dinners. I used to have a cookie each night, or a quarter of a pint of ice cream, but now I've changed it to *literally 5 peanut M&amp;Ms*. I feel like I am going crazy.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that I woke up in the middle of the night with a crazy calf cramp and saw that my glucose has been elevated ever since then -- either I messed up my Stelo or something \"snapped\" in my body. Spikes are now lasting longer and going higher. The lowest glucose I'm hitting is in the high 90s... and that's when I am asleep.\n\nThe doctor says I'm perfectly healthy, but I physically don't feel healthy when I am spiking, and my average glucose is now in the mid 120s. Is this undiagnosed prediabetes? Insulin resistance? Am I not advocating enough for my health? Regardless, I ordered another Stelo (3rd and 4th sensors) to confirm if my current sensor got tweaked.",

I believe I increases them by about 50%. Instead of macerating, I made a jam with a list of it and macerated some. The output was slightly tarter but had a stronger strawberry flavor and everyone loved it. When I had it with proper care that is eat a whole bunch of fiber first. Don't eat too much on the protein heavy main course, have a small serving, and start moving immediately afterwards. It didn't even register in the CGM. Another thing to experiment was is cinnamon. I believe it is supposed to lower blood glucose and the smell causes things to feel really sweet even though it's not. Finally, use stevia to lower the overall sugar amount even more. \n\nI was considering making a compote and adding chia or basil seeds to increase the fiber content. Haven't done that. \n\nThe last time I made it, I made it to the recipe although I added cinnamon. My wife didn't like it. Could've been the cinnamon in which case he careful and experiment or was at least partially the reduced strawberry flavor and increased sugar. \n\nThe egg whites I made into an accompanying meringue. https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-swiss-meringue-recipe\n\nAgain significantly lower the amount of sugar and add freeze dried strawberries. It'll hold the structure. I believe I used half cup sugar, half cup freeze dried strawberries with 8 egg whites",

Each test also has it's own caveats/pitfalls that can result in inaccuracies and false positives.\n\nThe insulin clamp is considered the gold standard, followed by LPIR and OGTT. A1C is pretty reliable and is usually the first go-to because it's cheap, easy and available. Calculations like HOMA and TyG correlate to the insulin clamp, but can be a little unreliable in certain conditions. So they're often used when they can be checked against another test.\n\nLike others have said, a1c can be inaccurate with certain conditions (anemia, recent blood donation, etc).\n\nHOMA and TyG uses fasting insulin/glucose/triglycerides and a single test for those can be abnormal; for example, if you slept like crap the night before, your glucose can be higher than what's normal for you, so the results will be skewed.",

It’s just tough cause I work two jobs, one an overnight stocking job and another pharmacy job. I’m always on my feet and moving, I’m getting back into biking to my overnight job to get that daily cardio. \nSo as you can see, I can’t do much about my sleep. I’m not gonna be able to regularly get 8 hours of sleep. Am I really not going to be able to fix this without fixing my sleep too? \n\nMy doctor didn’t even believe that I NEEDED an A1c test because my glucose has always been “so beautiful” in her words. I regularly get blood tested and donated because of other reasons so it’s well tracked. I only asked for the A1c test cause the Red Cross told me I was prediabetic, and then they were right. The biggest change in my life has been this second job, and my even worse sleep because of it. Is it possible that this ONE thing tipped me over the edge? ",

        "body": "Yeah, sleep disruption alone can push A1c into prediabetic range, especially with shift work and stress. Poor sleep messes with insulin sensitivity and keeps cortisol elevated, which raises fasting glucose over time. Even if your daytime glucose looks fine, A1c reflects your average over months, so chronic stress and irregular rhythms can tip things.\n\nThe good news is you’re already doing a lot right with an active job, biking, and awareness. With your schedule, focus on meal timing and balance (protein, fiber, fat to slow carbs), and get in short post-meal walks when you can. Even 10 to 15 minutes helps. Sleep quality matters more than perfect quantity here, so blackout curtains, cool temps, and limiting caffeine near sleep can make a difference, if time limited try with nsdr. These are some good habits to start: https://glucospike.ai/blog/just-found-out-you-re-borderline-pre-diabetic-start-with-these-7-golden-rules",

        "body": "Have your fasting insulin checked.  It could be your glucose is normal because a high insulin level is masking it.  Blood insuline is a simple test.  You should have them do glucose and insulin on the same blood sample, first thing in the morning before you've eaten anything.   Optimal fasting insulin is under 8 (some say 5, some say 10).  Mine is 22.7, so I'm working on that.   Don't be fooled by the wide \"normal\" range.  Normal does not equal good.\n\nOnce you have a fasting glucose and a fasting insulin number, you can plug them into a free online HOMA-IR calculator that will give you your HOMA-IR score.   Anything about 2.9 is significant insulin resistance.  You'd like it to be 1 or lower.    Mine is 4.8, so I'm working on lowering my insulin resistance.\n\nHigh fasting insulin and a high HOMA-IR score would indicate insulin resistance, and that could be your problem.\n\nBut there are 6 other things it could be.

What is your diet? Try to find the right amount of food that doesnt spike you so high, maybe youll be fine eating 3/4 of what you put on that plate but the food intake after that amount is the threshold were you body is like ok were getting jammed up here this is gonna take a while which is where your seeing the glucose in your blood rather than in your cells but the fact that your levels return to normal or close to at the 2 hour mark is a good sign, look up how to improve mitochondria health and zone 2 cardio and also look up what are the things that insult mitochondrial health like poor food and lifestyle",

Scary, because meta-cognitively I knew something was up but had no idea why. I got my hands on a glucometer and my blood sugar was 397 after eating chicken soup with potatoes and onions and carrots.\n\nAlso, because of our age and slight build, our metabolic engine is not what it used to be. Weight lifting, especially targeting quads and glutes, will give you a sugar-burning machine again. Start slow, because ANY resistance is good. Your goal is to lift to failure. \nCheck out William Shang’s, “the thin pre-diabetic” and his other book, Fighting Insulin Resistance With Strength Training.\n\nIf we don’t train, our type 2 muscle fibers get trimmed back and they are a way to decrease insulin resistance and increase glucose absorption thru GLUT-4 receptors in the muscles. But it takes exercising the muscle to failure. \n\nThis will keep you out of the rest home and improve the quality of your life. I’d get a trainer if this is foreign to you. You can do this!",

It also took about the same amount of time for me to notice any difference in my numbers (stelo cgm).\n\nIf you think it will help, give it a try for a few days. If the side effects are tolerable at the start, give it some time and it get better. If it's bad, tell your doc so you can quit filling those prescriptions and try something else. A lot of the people who have the really bad side effects start out with more than 500mg, and are not taking the ER version. \n\nFor the OP, I have drastically changed my diet since January and lost about 30 lb. I started 500mg ER Metformin in September and lost maybe another 3-5 lb? It has not been noticeable, or clear if it's anything to do with the med. \n\nMy guess is a low dose of Metformin might support \"lifestyle\" changes, but won't do much on its own for weight loss. However, 500mg has made a difference in my glucose, which is the reason I'm taking it. My CGM numbers are much flatter and lower. I also feel somewhat better overall-- more energy? It's subtle, so I'm not 100% sure it's the medication, but I've read that can be a good side effect.",

    "selftext": "Started bulking(dirty) last year since i'm a naturally lean person. I went from 193 Lbs to 215 Lbs. Obviously was still working out. At 215 Lbs, I started having alot of what seemed like schizophonia... Audio hallucinations. So around this time, my neck had gotten bigger and I was dealing with what i assume was undiagnosed Sleep Apnea. So I can attribute the hallucinations to lack to quality sleep. Anyways, 3 months ago. I got diagnosed with prediabetes(5.7 A1C). Around this time I weighed 210 Lbs( I started my weight cut). I got into a keto/intermittent fasting(16:8, eating twice a day) diet plan while fasting for 24 hours at the end of every week. For the first month I was strict on my keto diet. Didn't eat at restaurants, ate mostly egg, salmon, avocado, red meat, tilapia, boneless Chicken, broccoli. Making keto meals i learned on youtube(heavens kitchen keto), walking for 10 mins after meals consistently. Second month i loosened my grip slightly and started eating out for dinner when I got lazy and only cooked lunch for the week. End of 2nd month, reintroduced decent amount of carbs in my diet due to having lost 30 pounds and not wanting to go below 180 Lbs, I wasn't dealing with Sleep Apnea anymore. 3rd month, started eating slightly more carbs and drinking alot of low carb beers(coors light) with keto friendly cookies, eating out slightly more but still centered around fiber and protein as main diet. Went in for a blood test yesterday, Says I am now 5.0 A1C",

        "body": "Different things work better for different people. So I have some things you can experiment with.  \n\nIf you can not afford a CGM, get a basic finger tester.  \n\nIt sounds like your overnight numbers are one of your key concerns. My recommendation would be testing before bed, (if you have a snack before bed, test an hour after eating and if you are still awake, two hours after eating), when you wake up before getting out of bed, an hour later, and two hours later.  There are hormonal changes when you wake up that will increase your blood glucose. This will help you to see what type of effect that has on you specifically. This combination of testing times will also help you to see how what you are eating is affecting your morning glucose levels. (You can cut back on testing times based on the trends you notice.)  \n\nYou can also test during the day to see the effect of various foods.  Test before eating, one hour after eating, and two hours after eating. (If you are not close to the starting number at 2 hours, test again at 3 hours.)\n\nSome things to experiment with: \n\n- Small low carb, high protein &amp; fiber snack before bed: Casien (not whey) protien powder chia seed pudding is a good option. Broccoli with mozzerella and cottage cheese is another good option. \n\n- Stop eating for the day between 4pm and 6pm\n\n- Stretch out eating times.  Set a timer after eating a meal for when you will eat again to limit snacks. (3 to 8 hours)\n\n- Short duration low to moderate intensity exercise before bed (exercise helps regulate your glucose for hours after. So this time targets your overnight and morning glucose.)  Just ten or fifteen minutes is fine. This doesn't need to be a big thing.\n\n- Move your workout or add a workout to the afternoon/evening. (Any intensity is fine.  Studies show that afternoon and evening workouts have more affect on fasting glucose than morning workouts. If you can only work out in the morning, exercising is still more helpful than not.  Do not ditch your work out.)\n\n\n\nGenerally good options that help:\n\n- No or limited caloric drinks. So, no sugar with your coffee.  No juice. No smoothies.  You can also try modifying your drinks to be less caloric. You could mix Ollipop with sparkling water for instance, so that you started with a lower sugar drink and then cut the sugar in half again.\n\n- Taper your carbs, more in the morning and less at night.  Think 30g carbs or less for a meal and 15g for a snack as a starting place. You may need more or less based on activity levels.\n\n- More fiber\n\n- More low carb veggies\n\n- Low carb veggies with every meal\n\n- No \"naked\" carbs.  Eat in order: Fiber, protein, fat, carbs.  Do not have carbs by themselves.\n\n- Protein and fiber in every meal\n\n- Portion controlled carbs (preferably high fiber like raspberries).  \n\n- More and better sleep. Go to bed earlier.\n\n- Lower stress (I know, easier said than done...)\n\n- Walk/mild exercise after eating",

Within 3 hours of waking up, my blood glucose will show higher and lower numbers.  That is normal.  \n\n2. The at home testers are less accurate.  If you tested while waiting at the clinic to get bloodwork, keep that number in mind as a sign of how off your meter is. Of you tested before going to the clinic, numbers can change for lots of reasons, and it doesn't tell you anything about the accuracy. \n\n3. You have high fasting insulin. Maybe the level went down from when you tested until they drew blood because of the high levels of insulin.\n\nWaking up one time to a 100 means nothing - even if it were a lab test. If it is not a fasting number, 100 is completely normal and healthy.  Even as a fasting number, that is not that bad because it is right on the cut off.   \n\nFor fasting number, you need a trend for it to matter.",

They’ve “reversed” prediabetes \n\nPerson B finds out they have an A1C of 6.5. They also change their diet, exercise more and drop their A1C to 5.5 but because they crossed the threshold they’re a lifelong type 2 diabetic who is in remission.\n\nWhat exactly did person A reverse that person B did not  and never will for the rest of their life?  It’s not like person A can immediately start eating pop tarts and ramen noodles every other day. Both person A and B have to continue a certain lifestyle and closely monitor their sugar intake  or they’re both at risk of getting to diabetic levels again. Sounds like remission for both A and B to me. \n\nI say all of this because I’m person A and when I told my husband that I reversed my prediabetes he goes “oh so you’re cured and can eat like a normal person again”. Mind you, this man has a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast literally every morning, eats pad Thai once a week and eats pizza with French fries with our kids every Friday. His vigorous workout routine consist of walking the dog and his once a week Mens league softball game that’s always followed by a few beers with the team he also LOVES Reese’s peanut butter cups. He gets blood work done yearly and has never had an A1C higher than 5.2 😡\n\nEven  if I didn’t have a carb for literally 5 years if I ate like him for 6 months I would almost certainly develop type 2 diabetes. I’ll always be at risk and never be able to eat like people like him So what exactly did I reverse? I still have to eat differently than the rest of my family probably forever. Sorry this is mostly just a rant and maybe I’m just playing semantics with the word “reverse” but to me it really seems like once you get prediabetes you can never be like you were before. You have to create a new normal or else it comes back again. That sounds like a life long remission to me because there are people out there like my husband who can mostly eat whatever they want and be fine. \n\nEnd rant\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Still, I’m seeing small improvements. I also think it depends on how you reduce your AIC. If it is just keto, it will go back up as soon as you eat carbs again. Within the past year I have worked on strength training and building muscle. I’ve done a satisfactory job here though lm not a gym rat by any means. So, this may drive the improved spikes. I find also if I reducing saturated fats, my body is more forgiving of carbohydrates. I have read research that saturated fats clogs your cells so they can’t take up as much glucose and so it stays in your system. My thought that right now I need to give my pancreas time to rest. Either by food or having muscles do more of the lifting. The fewer spikes, the more rest. And then it may not be 100% but it will be better.",

If you get your A1c into healthy ranges, have a healthy weight and increase muscle mass, lose visceral fat, you are not longer prediabetic and you have improved insulin sensitivity,  reduced insulin resistance etc. Your body will probably tolerate carbs better, but if you went back to eating just like you did before, what made you prediabetic,  you will most certainly go back to being prediabetic.  That means lifelong changes still but not necessarily no carbs ever. Eating like you described isnt just bad for glucose, its bad for your health overall and will decrease longevity and hurt other health outcomes.  So I wouldn't say its a remission if you were never actually diabetic, but you will absolutely need to stay active and eat healthier forever.",

Once something is broken along the glucose metabolic chain, there is very low likelihood of repair. \n\nI get frustrated when people say diabetes is lifestyle related. I don’t believe so as much anymore. I think we need to look into what comes first, the chicken or the egg.\n\nIf you look at how beta cells are formed, you’ll find it very interesting. You are born with all the beta cells that you will ever have. They replenish themselves in a different way than our other cells.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research and it really seems like we’re in the infancy of recognizing the different types of type two diabetes. I do believe that some are exposure related. Similar to radiation exposure causing cancer. What if the exposure to glyphosate in our diet is what’s responsible for creating damage to the B cells and therefore causing metabolic dysfunction? What if exposure to viruses damages the beta cells and causes metabolic dysfunction? What if exposure to vaccines as a child causes damage to your beta cells, and therefore metabolic dysfunction. Have we examined thoroughly the exposures that could be responsible for damaging the beta cells?\n\nWe are 100% behind the curve (pun intended) when it comes to early monitoring. We know that post meal glucose spiking is the first sign of metabolic dysfunction. Order a Stelo CGM online and stick one on your hubby. He could be spiking to an insane number post meal, then followed by an insane dump of insulin. This will not show up on A1C. It’s so rapid that it doesn’t collect in the blood. BUT!!! That wave of insulin eventually taxes the beta cells, and that’s when you start seeing resistance. \n\nThe glucose metabolic chain is sooo complex. Have you heard of Type 3c???? Neither had I. Look it up. \nMedicine needs to do a better job identifying what exactly along the chain is broken. Is it always the beta cells? \n\nEnd rant. 🤣",

They don’t as an adult. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6986204/\n\n“Consequently, the number of β-cells found in children during their early years is probably close to the full complement that is then retained for the remainder of life. Studies of lipofuscin accumulation coupled with mathematical modeling of cell turnover in adult β-cells have argued that the cells are very long-lived with minimal rates of division [5].”\n\n\nNotwithstanding these obstacles, we know that the highest rates of human beta cell replication occur during infancy (0–3 yr), thereafter declining from youth to adulthood (131, 168, 275), with the peak in beta cell mass per kilogram body weight preceding the increase in insulin demand that occurs during puberty (177). The increase in beta cell mass during infancy mainly results from an increase in the number of beta cells per islet rather than the number of islets (168). A study using thymidine analogs administered 8 days to 4 yr before death found that beta cell labeling could be detected only in the youngest patients (18–20 yr old) and was absent from subjects over 30 yr of age (194), confirming that the human beta cell mass is largely established by the age of 20 (55).\nSimilar to other cell populations, the beta cell mass is not only determined by hyperplasia but also balanced by cell death through apoptosis, a process collectively referred to as “remodeling” (90). The frequency of beta cell apoptosis in pancreases obtained from normal human fetuses and infants is low during weeks 17–32 of gestation, increases perinatally, and declines again after 6 mo of age, adding to the relative increase in beta cell abundance at early childhood.\nThe limited proliferative capacity of adult human beta cells implies they have an extended lifespan. Cellular longevity can be deduced from intracellular lipofuscin body content. Lipofuscin bodies are multivesicular storage organelles from the lysosomal system, and their accumulation in a cell is an indication of cell aging. An age-related increase in the fraction of lipofuscin body-positive beta cells has been observed in human (89% in 1 yr olds, 95% in 5 yr olds, 97% in 20 yr olds, and 98% after age 50), again supporting the conclusion that the human beta cell mass is largely established by the age of 20 (54, 55).\nDespite the low rates of beta cell replication in adult humans, some research efforts have focused on the stimulation of beta cell replication as a means of beta cell replacement.",

Most of the diagnosis I hear were from A1C tests.\n\nI was diagnosed with prediabetes after having an oral glucose tolerance test in May 2024. My 2-hour reading at the time was 10.1mmol and an A1C of 6.0%. Fasting level was 5.1. \n\nSince then I have been restricting carbs and doing a modest amount of exercise every week. I am very lean to begin with, having a BMI of 17.7. My A1C throughout the whole time remain elevated at 5.6-6.1%. Disappointed was an understatement and I was at the point of breaking down. \n\nI’ve tried wearing cgm for a month and I was consistently getting readings of 8-10mmol at the 2 hour mark. I’ve confirmed this with finger pricks. In fact they only return to baseline after 3-4 hours. During this time my carb intake was around 90g a day max and I always eat in the correct order too: fibre-protein-carb.\n\nSo last month my endo sent me for another OGTT to figure out what’s going on. I’ve been told to increase my carb intake to 150g a day for at least 3 days prior to the OGTT to avoid false positives, and the result took me by surprise. \n\nI was so sure my 1-hour reading would be above 13mmol.. but\n\nA1C was 5.9%, 1-hour reading at 9.1mmol and 2-hour at 6.3. How is this possible?! I did a finger prick when I got home straight after the test and it was 8.3. My house was only 5 mins away. \n\nI don’t get it. I’m pretty sure I’m not in remission because every ounce of carb spikes me like crazy. ",

I was eating 30-50g of carb a day, active (lift, run, pilates, bike) every day, and lower end BMI (19, but I am Asian and our BMI to manage T2 diabetes scale is slightly different due to our genetic predisposition). As a result, my endo put me on metformin. I also wear a CGM to manage my blood sugar. I can’t eat more than 15g of carb at a time or I spike unfortunately, and it’s far less manageable than when I had gestational diabetes twice. \n\nFrom wearing the CGM and controlling spikes I brought my A1C down from April to October, it now being 5.6. \n\nTLDR, endocrinologist was able to talk to me about my entire history. For some of us, medication is the only way. Maybe an endocrinologist can give you some more personalized guidance. Good luck!",

I remember back in the day when Dr John McDougall MD was popular (RIP), a lot of people were on these high starch, whole foods low fat diets claiming that it helped them regain their insulin sensitivity and reversed their insulin resistance long term. It takes some time and causes weight gain initially but works long term (according to people on it). The theory was that you have to do to high carb low fat (long term gain) or high fat low carb (short term gain, long term metabolic stress). Doing high carb, high fat is an issue as fat coats the cells or insulin receptors, preventing the sugars being taken up into cells, leading to high blood sugar. I guess this sort of makes sense but I can’t find much research saying exactly this and I didn’t learn it in med school either. \n\nFrom my understanding, a whole foods diet (if we really were to only eat what we could naturally forage and hunt) would naturally contain complex carbs, some proteins and not that much fats, so a keto diet always just seemed too far fetched for me and same with a diet without any meat. \n\nI’ve bought my meal prep for next week, it includes Korean eggs and quinoa for breakfast, tuna pasta for lunch, and chicken breast and potato for dinner. I guess pasta isn’t really a  whole foods .. but otherwise,  if I stick to it it’ll definitely be the healthiest week of eating I’ve probably had in my life.  ",

I think it can be really helpful for some people but it definitely wouldn't be something you'd find in nature. Animals just don't have enough fat when they're wild, and high fat plants (avocadoes, coconut) come with enough carbs to prevent keto.\n\nI do think there's something to high carb low fat (and they really mean low fat, so a whole foods diet may not necessarily cut it; if you're including nuts and avocado or too many eggs then it might not work as intended). But yeah, there's no intervention that works for *everyone*, so we all gotta do whatever we gotta do. For some of us that will probably be low carb/keto. I'm currently trending in that direction because blood sugar spikes really mess with my mental health, personally. \n\nGood luck! It works for a lot of people who stick to it. Hope it works for you.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, glad this group is around. Thought I'd just share some stuff about my journey and hoping that I am on the right path.\n\n  \nI'm 38 m, was diagnosed with prediabetes (6.7!). I'm pretty active; well, the activeness went down a bit due to injury. \n\n\n\nLong story short, I had knee surgery, and before that, they had to run some blood work. And that's where they detected that I was prediabetic. If it weren't for my knee surgery, I probably would have done blood work waaay later. My doctor offered me metformin or to immediately change my diet. I decided to change my diet first. \n\n  \nAnywho, I kinda disregarded it (changing my diet) post surgery, with the ego that \"meh. I'm still 38, I'm prediabetic. I can still eat like crap.\" \n\n  \nAbout two months ago, I felt extremely fatigued. I was eating a breakfast burger and felt tired. And so I thought I needed coffee; therefore, I had Vietnamese coffee (I'm sure some of you know, that thing is like crack lol). The weird thing is that I IMMEDIATELY passed out after having vietnamese coffee. Usually, I'd be up for hours and hours with that thing. That's when I knew something was off. \n\n  \nSince then, I made changes. The big one was that I immediately stopped drinking lattes, and went for black coffee instead/chaggachino (tastes good and doesn't spike up my glucose).\n\n  \nI have a Stelo as well, so I've been watching closely what seems to be spiking my glucose, etc.\n\nI mainly drink just water now. If I'm drinking alcohol, it would be hard liquor or a seltzer. I've cut down rice (this was a bit tough being Filipino lol), and increased my protein even more so. \n\nI've also increased my physical activity since surgery, which should help. The biggest win so far is that I lost 13 pounds literally in a month (from 181 to 168). That's great and all, but I'm really more focused on getting my glucose down. \n\n  \nI'm planning on getting bloodwork done at the end of the year and I'm hoping for better results.  \n\n  \nI'm noticing several threads here about reversing prediabetes, etc., and I, too, am now trying to understand it a bit better. \n\nIt seems like once I reverse prediabetes (and I hope I will), I can't just revert to my old ways. And this can be a huge challenge for many of us, especially if our loved ones are eating whatever they want, with no repercussions. \n\n  \nBut I'm also learning to accept that hey, maybe I shouldn't revert back to my old ways anyway, as it's just going to impact my health (beyond diabetes). I presume that yes, I can eventually have some cheat days here and there, but it just can't be like the old days. And this is even when I fully reverse prediabetes. \n\n  \nAnyway, I wanted to say hello, and I love the support in this group. I hope i'm in the right track. Would love to hear any advice from any of you! \n\n  \nMy avg glucose has been at 120 but has now dropped to 110. I'd love for it to be in the 90's. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\n36M.  Over the past few months I’ve been battling with the dawn effect.  I’ve been consistently having a morning fasting glucose anywhere between 95-105.  I’ve tried everything to get this down, not eating 3hrs before bed, exercise after dinner, low carb diet, minimal sweets/sugars.  I did intermittent fasting for a month with no change.  I went 18hrs of not eating and had a reading of 100, like wtf.  But once I eat, workout, all that stuff my levels will return to about 75-85 most of the day.\n\nI got an A1C test a week ago and it came back at 5.1 which is well within healthy range. My doc is like “you’re no where near approaching pre-diabetic status, you’re fine”.\n\nBackround on my health, I workout 5 days a week, very fit and muscular with 8% body fat.  I do have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis but up until recently it never caused glucose issues.\n\nAny insight or help would be appreciated, thank you.",

I’ve never in my life had a result higher than a 90 so it caught me off guard.  I started to monitor my levels and realized I was always a tad high in the mornings.  Doing research it says levels above 100 could indicate the start of pre-diabetes which is why I am now here asking questions lol. I probably am giving myself anxiety but it is quite strange being as fit as I am to have these high levels in the morning when I should be in the 80’s or low 90’s.

        "body": "Totally normal man. That’s the dawn effect, not insulin resistance. Around 4-8 a.m. your body releases cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon to get you ready for the day, so blood sugar rises a bit. It’s basically your liver dumping out a little glucose.\n\nYou’re super lean and train often, which actually makes this more noticeable because your glycogen stores are lower and your body’s stress response is strong. An A1C of 5.1 is excellent, you’re nowhere near prediabetic territory.\n\nIf you want to blunt it a bit:\n\n• Have a small protein + slow carb snack before bed - something like casein with oats or chickpeas.\n\n• Avoid long fasts - going 16-18 hours can raise cortisol and make morning glucose higher.\n\n• Keep doing resistance training and post-meal walks - they help the most long term.\n\n• Make sure magnesium and overall carb intake are adequate - super low carb diets can keep stress hormones up.\n\nHashimoto’s can slightly play into it, but probably not in the way you’re thinking. When thyroid function slows down, metabolism and insulin clearance can too, which sometimes nudges fasting glucose a bit higher. But your A1C and post-meal numbers show that your body’s handling glucose perfectly fine.\n\nIf your thyroid levels (especially free T3) are well-managed and you’re not hypo, then the dawn effect you’re seeing is just a normal hormonal rhythm, not a Hashimoto’s problem.\n\nSo yeah, Hashimoto’s might make you a bit more sensitive to cortisol shifts, but it’s not causing a diabetic pattern here.",

        "body": "72 mg/dL isn’t dangerous, it’s still within the normal range. You’re probably just feeling it because you cut carbs way too fast. When you drop carbs suddenly, your glycogen runs out and your body hasn’t fully switched to burning fat yet, so you end up feeling tired or a little off.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you’re hypoglycemic or diabetic, it’s just your metabolism adjusting. If you’re not shaky or sweating, you’re fine.\n\nAlso, low carb isn’t always the magic fix. A lot of people cut carbs and then replace them with too much saturated fat, which can actually make insulin resistance worse for some people. Diets very high in butter, cheese, or fatty meats can reduce insulin sensitivity and make blood sugar harder to control long-term. What really helps is focusing on balance — include lean protein, healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, nuts, and fish, and don’t completely remove complex carbs like lentils, oats, or quinoa. These foods help keep blood sugar stable without the crash.\n\nTry easing into lower carb instead of cutting everything overnight. Add a few slow carbs like lentils, quinoa, or veggies, drink enough water, and make sure you’re getting your electrolytes. Your blood sugar will likely even out once your body adapts.\n\nIf your sugar ever drops below 65 or you start feeling shaky or lightheaded, have a small carb snack and keep an eye on it.",

    "selftext": "I had some blood work done last week. The results suggest my glucose is within range (5.1 mmol/), however, my insulin levels are extremely high (14.6 mIU/L).\n\nI would like to take all steps to avoid entering pre-diabetes terrain (evidently I am developing insulin resistance). In the past week, I've improved my diet, reducing sugar and carbs. I too have started exercising daily.\n\nMy question: my doctor has advised taking Glucophage (Metformin). While I'm aware Glucophage helps in making Insulin more sensitive, I'm wondering 1) whether it will cause dependency (wherein my body's beta cells will stop producing insulin in a healthy manner)? and 2) whether Glucophage really will help address my insulin resistance?\n\nI really want to avoid this insulin resistance progressing into prediabetes. Your assistance and suggestions would go a long way! Thanks!",

        "body": "Metformin (Glucophage) doesn’t cause dependency or make your pancreas “lazy.” It mainly works by reducing liver glucose output and improving insulin sensitivity in your muscles - it doesn’t force your pancreas to produce more insulin. In fact, it can take some strain *off* your beta cells by lowering how hard they have to work.\n\nThat said, if your glucose is still normal and you’ve only just started cutting carbs and exercising daily, you might not need to jump to medication right away. For many people with early insulin resistance, consistent exercise (especially resistance training), improved sleep, and a lower-glycemic diet can make a big difference within a few weeks or months. Your doctor likely suggested Metformin as a preventive measure, since it’s generally safe and well-tolerated.  On cutting carbs, this should be done carefully.  Cutting carbs doesn't equate to removing carbs.  In the absence of carbs, your body will be glycogen depleted and you wont be able to build muscles.  So, start by lower GI diet but as you work towards putting muscle mass start including complex carbs like brown basmati rice, quinoa, steel cut oats etc.  Another important fact is avoiding saturated fats as they will cause hepatic insulin resistance &amp; in low carb situations may also make physiological insulin resistance worse.\n\nIf you do start it, it’s not a “forever” medication - some people taper off once they’ve reversed their insulin resistance through lifestyle. But that should be done under supervision and after tracking improvements in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and A1C over time.\n\nMetformin can help, but lifestyle is the real fix. If you’re already improving diet and exercise, you’re absolutely on the right path.",

A few key rules: balanced meals are crucial, and it's best to avoid deep-fried foods since they can worsen insulin resistance. Post-meal walks also help.

        "body": "Fasting glucose can vary due to genetics (normal for one person can be 75 and 95 for another) and there isn't much consistency in each test (fasting glucose naturally fluctuates). It's not very reliable for T2D.\n\nA1c measures glucose averages over 3 months, so it's more reliable.\n\nAside from the variability in fasting glucose, a wide gap between fasting glucose and a1c can also appear due to how your insulin resistance presents. You may have a more normal fasting glucose, but post prandial elevations may be severe and normal glucose elevations (due to hormones or physical activity) may be more exaggerated causing a1c to be high. These elevations indicate that your body isn't responding correctly to insulin.\n\nThink of it like: Insulin resistance -&gt; bigger glucose elevations -&gt; higher average glucose -&gt; higher a1c\n\nGoogle \"insulin resistance and area under the curve (AUC)\" and you'll find a better explanation.\n\nFasting glucose also tends to rise with insulin resistance, but everyone's \"normal\" reference point is a little different, so it's hard to say how much your fasting glucose is elevated by looking at one test.",

Since your body is already full of stored energy (fat) when the insulin knocks on the door of cells to say take this energy (glucose) that just came in, the cells are like, \"No, we're all full up here.\"  So that glucose just gets shuffled around, door to door, looking for somewhere, anywhere, to go.  The body eventually starts cramming it in places it shouldn't go like the liver as fat (causing NAFLD or 'fatty liver').  But there's a finite amount of places it can go.  Most of us stop making new fat cells after puberty and each of those cells has a max capacity.

Diet is my biggest problem though - I eat lots of processed foods and sugar, especially right now as I’ve been struggling with depression and ADHD and have low energy for cooking and exercise. I was wondering if I need to go scorched earth and start eating a super strict diet or if I can start by incorporating more fish, greens, etc. into my existing diet? Today I had some Siggi’s yogurt with strawberries, walnuts, and chia seeds for breakfast, and for lunch I had an apple and celery with peanut butter, some carrots, and more walnuts. But I’m still super hungry! 😭 And I have my partners birthday dinner and a bonfire this weekend where I know lots of unhealthy food will likely be present. I’m waiting to get an appointment set up with a dietitian but in the meantime, can I eat some sugar and carbs here and there or do I need to cut it out completely? Thanks!",

I  had to find ways to cook even if I was tired and didn't want to. I would come up with a list of foods that aren't hard to make. Right now you need to make sure you are eating more. Focus on getting more protein not just from nuts and peanut butter but eggs, chicken, tuna in moderation other forms of meat or protein products.  I focus on veggies at most meals then eating protein then eating fats and carbs in that order. If you are going to have dessert eat it right after dinner and then do calf raises of go for a short walk it can help with the spikes. Eat half the dessert and don't let it become and everyday thing. I know ADHD can cause all or nothing thinking but I would work on that. If you eat one cookie you dont have to freak out and sabatoge. I stopped labeling food as good or bad. I stopped placing so much value on food. I started really small with excercise and worked my way up slowly. Had to find what works for me. Try to not be rigid and take small steps often. Do t jump into restriction causes more issues especially with insulin issues and even leads to binging. I can't do low carb doesn't work for me.  Some people get continuous glucose monitors which shows what food spikes you. They aren't through insurance though. It's a lot and can be overwhelming. Start small and find what works for you. There is a lot of noise and I had to be mindful about not becoming obsessive. ",

Between 124mg/dL to 140mg/dL (6.9 to 7.8 mmol) was only 4 - 9% of the time, depending on age.\n\nSee this American Diabetes Association Publication which states that because high glucose is toxic and causes many types of tissue damage, any indicator of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) is predictive of diabetes complications.\nhttps://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/Supplement_2/S184/28282/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Diagnosing-Diabetes-With-A1C\n\nSee https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109707034444?via%3Dihub      In this publication from the American Journal of Cardiology, it says that exaggerated post-meal spikes in blood glucose and lipids when repeated multiple times daily eventually lead to atherosclerotic risk factors and CAD (Coronary Artery Disease).\n\nAt only 80 mg/dl = 4.4 mmol/L the Cardiovascular (CV) risk of post-meal elevated blood sugar starts to increase. By 140 mg/dl = 7.8 mmol/L, the point at which we traditionally only begin to classify patients as glucose intolerant or pre-diabetic, the risk is already increased by 58%\n\nThere are other health risks also from blood sugar spikes. I would recommend continuing to use a CGM to identify which foods spike your blood sugar the least, and try and keep your blood sugar as low as possible. Exercise is also important eg a walk after eating. Resistance exercise is meant to improve glycemic control by increasing muscle glucose uptake, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and boosting metabolism. Weights or resistance bands.",

My doctor isn’t concerned about my blood test results, but I’m left feeling unsure whether I’m being overly worried or if his lack of guidance is an issue.\n\nTest Results:\n\nSpring 2025: A1C 5.4, Fasting Glucose 6.7\n\nSummer 2025: Fasting Glucose 7 (A1C not tested). I had significant stress and a panic attack the night before this test, which may have affected the result.\n\nFall 2025: A1C 5.1, Fasting Glucose 6.1\n\nBetween these tests, I made significant diet and lifestyle changes. From spring to summer, I eliminated soda and limited chips and candy. From summer to fall, I cut out almost all processed sugars and carb-heavy foods, essentially eating as if I were diabetic. I also made sure to walk after meals and exercise 3-5 times a week.\n\nI’ve shared my concerns with my doctor, especially given my family history (mom is pre-diabetic, great-grandmother had type 2 diabetes), and expressed my interest in trying for a baby soon. However, my doctor didn’t seem concerned and, when I received my latest blood work results, he simply noted that my fasting glucose was near normal, with no further advice or testing. \n\nDespite my efforts, I’m still struggling with my fasting glucose remaining only slightly above normal. I feel like something isn’t quite right, and I’m frustrated by the lack of guidance. With the holidays approaching, I want to enjoy treats without compromising my health, but I spend a lot of time worrying about what I can eat, ensuring I exercise after meals, and feeling guilty when I indulge in sweets.\n\nI’m considering another appointment with my dr to discuss the results, but given that the last one was unhelpful and access to doctors in my area is limited, I’m not sure if it’s worth my time. I’m looking for advice from others who’ve been in similar situations—how do you approach managing your diet and lifestyle, and how did you get your doctor to take your concerns more seriously? Are there additional tests I should ask for, like a 2-hour glucose test or something else?\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nJust recently, my endocrinologist let me know I am “probably” prediabetic based on the pattern of impaired postprandial glucose (ie, insulin resistance) seen in my mixed meal study. \n\nThe thing is, on the one hand... during the study in question, which was a controlled mixed meal with a reasonable glycaemic index, my BG peaked at 251 mg/dL. With less balanced meals, I’ve recorded spikes as high as 333. In all cases, the BG remains &gt;200 at 2 hours, even with the high glycaemic index meals, which technically is one of the ways we diagnose full-blown diabetes. \n\nOn the other hand… my most recent A1C is 4.9% and has ranged from 4.6-5.3% in the 5 or so years I’ve had it tested, which is part of why it has been so difficult to get this issue taken seriously. The other part is that I weigh between 41-42 kg for 159 cms (\\~92 pounds for 5’3”) and although I have slightly high body fat % by DXA, the distribution is such that there is only 13% fat mass through the torso (to include metabolically relevant visceral fat) which is extremely low for a female. \n\nBased on this, part of me wants to be in denial and/or downplay my condition; however… I don’t think a body can achieve those BG numbers without a certain level of underlying pathology. I suspect the A1C is mostly explained by metformin, which keeps the sugars (and attendant reactive hypoglycaemia) under control no matter what I seem to eat, and the diet I follow most of the time is lower in carb anyway due to malabsorption issues. But, the minute I stop the metformin and have a sandwich like a normal people… high 200’s if not 300+. :(\n\nAltogether it makes me wonder just how far along the disease pathway am I really, with this level of insulin resistance ? More importantly, for any of you who have reached this stage of blood sugar dysregulation and subsequently improved, did you ever get to a point where you could eat a sandwich, unmedicated, and maintain something approaching normoglycaemia ? What did that take if so ?\n\nSorry for the long post. I am just feeling a bit stuck in having to face the reality of dealing with this but am scared it will continue to progress over time (I‘m &lt;40) and “lose weight to make it better” isn’t an option either.

According to a recent Chinese study, A1C sensitivity is inferior compared with fasting blood glucose at the population level (19). Also, people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), in whom the efficacy of diabetes prevention has been unequivocally proven (20), cannot be detected by A1C.\nBecause high glucose is toxic and causes many types of tissue damage, any indicator of hyperglycemia is predictive of diabetes complications.\nhttps://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/34/Supplement_2/S184/28282/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Diagnosing-Diabetes-With-A1C",

I think you are asking about an ED because of the possibility of hypercortisolaemia-associated insulin resistance which is common particularly in anorexia nervosa ? I thought this was a great idea too - not because of an ED and more due to the stress I am under/fact I am osteoporotic and fit this profile very well in all respects except, again, the body fat distribution. So I had cortisol tested with the C-peptide and the rest and of course… stone-cold normal. Very low chance excessive levels of another counter-regulatory hormone are to blame as most things that cause this are neoplastic and for unrelated reasons I had a DOTATATE scan that effectively ruled out that kind of tumour.\n\nSo at this point after years of symptoms I am just having to come to grips with the fact there is insulin resistance causing what is apparently some stage of diabetic disease and I need to figure out the best steps to take for my body to hopefully deal with it. :(",

Selfishly, I find it a bit comforting to know I’m not totally alone in being such an outlier with this. \n\nTo your questions - I left a response to a different poster re: LADA above. Basically my insulin secretion patterns don’t support an autoimmune aetiology. Type 3c would also not make much sense because I have no history of pancreas disease of any kind. I totally agree these are good things to consider and rule out in people like us, though. \n\nI do have rapid gastric emptying and small bowel transit… intermittently gastroparesis as well. Not likely a diabetes thing; I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and generally cursed genetics. It was suggested some element of dumping might be responsible for my hypoglycemic episodes, but after discovering by accident that they seem to always be preceded by marked hyperglycaemia, I think plain old insulin resistance is the culprit.\n\nCurious why you ask about German heritage? That’s not something I’m familiar with as a specific risk factor. I don’t have any German heritage but I am half Asian and know nonwhite ethnicities are predisposed to diabetes at comparatively lower BMI - likely due to differences in body composition vs a white reference group. \n\nThat leads to your last point - whilst my testosterone was recently tested and normal, I can definitely stand to gain some muscle mass and this is probably the lowest-hanging fruit for me, too. I’m in physical therapy 3x/week working to recover from orthopedic surgery no. 6 and build strength. It‘s been a bit of a slog but it is fun to see tangible progress with lifting, 1000x better than cardio. :)",

Either way, to your earlier post, DM (particularly type 2!) has a very strong genetic component but it sounds like you already know this !\n\nIf you have any concern for insulin -insufficiency- as opposed to insulin resistance as a cause for hyperglycaemia (to include LADA and other forms of beta cell damage such as type 3c diabetes), it is certainly worth undergoing a mixed meal test or similar to correlate insulin and glucagon levels with glucose levels.

        "body": "Hi. Hypoglycaemia can have multiple causes which should be considered but in the setting of (pre)diabetes this most commonly will be  postprandial (reactive) hypoglycaemia which occurs as a result of insulin resistance. This is diagnosed clinically by documentation of Whipple’s triad:\n\n1. Onset of symptoms after eating (typically \\~2-3 hours but it can vary depending on the individual and the meal)\n\n2. Documentation of low blood sugar (such as by fingerstick glucose readings)\n\n3. Resolution of symptoms with eating   \n\n  \nOP, if you suspect you are experiencing episodes of hypoglycaemia, the best thing you can do to help your doctor (and to have your concerns be taken seriously) is to purchase a simple fingerstick glucometer and check your levels when you are having symptoms. If your suspicions are confirmed, you can take a picture of the glucometer reading and show this to your doctor. If you are able to make a note of whether there is a relationship to when you last ate, it may be possible to confirm Whipple’s triad/reactive hypoglycaemia as well. I took these steps after documenting BGs as low as 45 and was diagnosed with RH without issue. If RH is not your problem, this info will still be helpful to have in order to figure out what might be causing it.",

My family has a history of diabetes but I thought I still had time considering I’m still in my mid 20s but I now understand this can happen to anyone especially to people who have a family history of this. After I gave birth I started to continue checking my blood sugar after 2 hours so far so good everytime it’s been below 140 even after eating fast food. Well today I ate cereal and for first time ever I was at 140 after the two hours. Anyways I’m now freaking out I have my postpartum glucose test next week and I’m just scared now. I know I’m all over the place but here goes my question is it normal to have it at 140 after 2 hours ? All I had was one bowl and it was corn flakes. I didn’t know it would be that bad. Can someone without prediabetes have a spike like that after eating one bowl of corn flakes I didn’t eat for hours prior to eating the cereal. ",

I've lowered my A1C from 6.2 to 5.8 as of April 2025. \n\nI worry about my nutrition and consumption of food (carbs and sugar) every day, and I know I drive my parents up the wall with it. My anxiety has been very annoying, but I've tried to stop.\n\nI was asking what my dad wanted to eat for dinner. I mentioned I was craving a calzone, and my dad stated that \"I crave pizza-like things a lot.\"\n\nMy dad said he didn't care what I ate, but when I tried to talk to him, he told me I had to make a choice. I could worry about my prediabetes when I buy pasta and eat cookies and chocolate all the time (which is not true), and it's my decision. I saw that he was frustrated. I was also told that I was xx years old, but I had to make choices. He also implied that he didn't want to hear me talk about prediabetes as long as I make decisions (that I suppose don't make sense). \n\nIt was not an enjoyable conversation. I started to cry, and the conversation did not provide any conversation, or addresing my anxiety and mental health struggles.\n\nI have been asked why would I need a dietitian or measure my blood sugar. My doctors are not concerned about my eating habits, and because I live at home, there are rules that I have to follow: I cannot cook until 10:30 am because my stepmom is sleeping, and so I try to not eat ceral or sweets, but it is very hard to eat quiet foods, especially since I work.\n\nI could buy my own food, but I don't make enough money for that. So after my dad said those words to me out of frustration, I felt such shame and almost had a panic attack. \n\nI feel out of control and don't know what to do. \n\nI have heard comments by my dad and adults in my life that \"I eat cookies all the time,\" and \"I wouldn't be able to survive without fat and sugar.\"\n\nI know I eat more sweets and carbs than I should, but how do I deal with this sense of pain and shame that I feel?\n\nI'm crying as I write this, and I don't know what step I should take next.

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious when you're getting mixed messages and struggling with food choices under difficult living circumstances, while also dealing with comments that make you feel judged. Your feelings of shame and being out of control are very real given everything you're experiencing. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these struggles, and it's important to remember that acknowledging these emotions is a significant first step. You're trying your best to take care of yourself, and it's okay to seek support when things feel difficult. Sometimes, finding resources that can help you understand and manage anxiety, including those intense moments where you feel on the verge of a panic attack, can make a big difference in regaining a sense of agency and calm. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, potential causes, coping strategies, and techniques for managing panic attacks, which some people find helpful for gaining perspective and practical tools. It might offer some insights as you figure out your next steps and work towards feeling more in control. God bless.",

I’ve tried to build structure through the perfect diet and did low carb high fat for about 2 years really exercising hard after every meal the first few months. Saw initial improvements in A1c but it rebounded and now cholesterol is high. I almost checked myself into a psych ward today actually and I have had multiple breakdowns trying to improve my health markers and it’s taking a huge tole on my mental health. I thrive in routine but I don’t know if this routine is working based on my last labs. I might try high carb low fat diet to try to reverse diabetes to build my tolerance to carbs so I can handle carbs better and lower cholesterol along the way but very scared and don’t know if it will work or make things worse. Nevertheless exercise will help the most especially after eating even if it’s just 15 minutes for medium to high intensity. Sorry for rambling too. But like I said I think if you can find some sort of routine especially around exercising after every meal no matter what kind of meal it is it will help you. Diet is a lever for sure and I sympathize with you and your family and doctor dynamic and am speaking from my experience. Sorry if I’m not helping calm you down I am struggling as well just want you to know you are not alone.

Give yourself the same compassion I KNOW you would give a friend.\n\nMy contribution is to let you know hunger/cravings are very complex, evolutionary biological drives. Its really hard to begin with, and then we add a psychological layer and no wonder we’re a society with metabolic disease and blood sugar problems.  We’ve never had this many crappy options and our brains aren’t wired to understand the changes in modern food. For example, a tsp of refined white sugar comes from 2 sugar canes which are over 6 feet tall. Imagine if you had to eat an entire cane of sugar. The stringy fiber would fill your stomach long before you ate the equivalent of a tsp of sugar. Every processed food we eat has had “the brakes” removed.\n\nFood order can resolve some of that. Having a salad first, with salty feta and olives, or crunchy nuts and tahini dressing slows down stomach emptying and makes you feel fuller.  Salads can be cooked vegetables, lettuces, low sugar fruits. Other brakes can be as simple as some cut up veggies ready-to-go in the frig, or taking a walk, or doing a zen tangle in your room. Just a break from impulsive behavior.\n\nRemove judgement. Begin observation. Ask yourself why you feel a certain way before you eat something—(notice I didn’t say, “something bad.”).   For some reason, you have connected this food impulse with some emotional feeling—relief, happiness, comfort. it offers something initially. Then you feel badly….Also, It sounds like you don’t live with your biological mom. Is there something there?\n\nAnd hey, you’ve improved your A1c! Under some difficult constraints. Give yourself some grace and recognize shame just creates a cycle of guilt. Your stumbling block is as big as you make it. Don’t give it more power than it deserves. \n\nI’ve been there.",

My sister bought me 2 advent calendars as gifts. Is 2 candies/chocolates a day for the month of December going to be problematic if I'm otherwise focusing on healthy eating?\n\n2. I usually have a single cup of tea, with milk and sugar, every morning. Do I need to start drinking it black or is this minor enough to be ok?\n\n3. The holidays are going to be non-stop with parties and family gatherings, filled with cookies and such. Do I need to abstain entirely (especially given the advent calendars I mentioned)? If not, how much can I reasonably treat myself and how often, without doing further damage?\n\n  \nI totally understand we're not doctors here and I do plan on reaching out to my doctor with questions as well.

If you are otherwise making all  excellent dietary choices and getting plenty of exercise, a small bit of DARK chocolate is  ok; other chocolate or candy, not really. \n\nIt’s a bit of a trade off too; if you ditch the rice and bread and potatoes and are eating lots of veggies and lean proteins and healthy fats, a very small chocolate treat after a meal is not going to do harm; but if your diet is less than optimal, it will only compound the issue.  \n\n2. Ditch the sugar, try subbing stevia instead. And while it is expensive, subbing pistachio milk for dairy milk has been a real game changer for me recently.\n\n3. The holidays can be tough. You will need to set firm limits for yourself, and de line most sweets/baked goods etc. you can help offset a spike by consuming a spoon of EVOO before allowing yourself an indulgence, but you still need to be selective and make smart choices. And when in doubt, just say no thanks.\n\nAnd save the few treats for the really good stuff. Don’t mindlessly eat a sugar cookie just because it’s there; save the indulgences for something special and more delectable - and then only a small amount. Sure, maybe have a sliver of pumpkin pie after a healthy low-carb meal - or maybe learn to make some keto-friendly desserts (because they won’t have added sugar), etc.\n\nAnd go for a walk after having a treat if possible; don’t just sit around idly.  It makes a difference!",

What you said about saving treats for the really good stuff mirrors what I was thinking already, and I do intend for my general eating to be as close to optimal as I can. I'm only on day 2 so I can't say I have good habits but I've already bought groceries to replace the rice/bread/potatoes and certainly intend to keep doing so. The leftover Halloween candy went out the door today for my partner to share at the office.\n\nThis has given some good suggestions on finding the balance, thanks for your help.",

Drinking your sugar is generally one of the worst things and cutting that out can make a big difference. \n\nAs far as occasional treats, I'm not sure how often is okay but a better way to think of it might be to not allow yourself to consume sweets or carbs alone and to exercise portion control. Try to have a well rounded meal before you have a sweet. That will accomplish two things. One you won't be as hungry and it will be easier to limit your portion of sweets, and two if you consume fats, protein, and fiber with your meal, that will slow down digestion of the carbs and reduce blood sugar spikes. You can also plan to go for a walk after consuming sweets. Don't eat sweets then sit.\n\nI think that putting a lot of focus into what you will eat could be helpful. Like making sure you have good high protein snacks around. Watch for hidden sugars in your food.",

I already mostly drink water, other than that morning tea, so luckily that won't be too much of a shift.\n\nTotally agree on the snacks. The first thing I did yesterday was figure out some healthy snacks I could keep in the house so that I don't for packaged and/or sugary things.

A few quick tips:\n\n* Advent calendars: 2 small chocolates a day isn't the end of the world if your meals are balanced and you're active. Pairing sweets with protein or fat helps blunt the glucose spike.\n* Tea with sugar: Try cutting the sugar in half first or switching to stevia/monk fruit. Milk is usually fine in small amounts. Best way to pair with roasted nuts.\n* Holiday parties: You don’t need to abstain, but prioritize protein and fiber at meals, and treat sweets like a side dish, not the main event. Space them out and avoid snacking on them solo. Plan some activities after having food\n\nBest way to learn this is using food coach app like glucospike ai app can show different meals affects our body.",

        "body": "There is no information anywhere online that I have found to say how often you can get away with having a treat. \nPost prandial (after-meal) glucose responses are highly variable between individuals, even when they eat the same foods, according to scientific studies. This is the case for non diabetics as well as diabetics. \nThis variability is influenced by a various factors, including genetics, gut microbiome, lifestyle, and metabolic health. Because of this, personalised diet plans are crucial for managing and preventing blood sugar spikes. The only way to work out a personalised plan is to use a Continuous Glucose Monitor. \nA new study by Weizmann Institute scientists has found that individual blood sugar levels in response to eating the exact same food vary dramatically. Some people can eat a small bit of dark chocolate after protein &amp; healthy fats, others can’t. Everyone has completely different responses to different foods. \nWalking/Exercise after eating sugar will not necessarily mean your blood sugar won’t spike badly. It doesn’t with me. \nEating EVOO before eating something that spikes blood sugar makes no difference at all to some people, see this short video https://youtube.com/shorts/0uzhEf9ynAM?si=4hLkK4vHRBPN7T_P\nAnd a cup of tea with milk and sugar would spike a lot of peoples blood sugar badly even after a high protein breakfast. So would eating sweets or a dessert after protein, fat and fibre. I can’t do it. A lot of the Glucose Goddess hacks don’t work for me.\nI would advise you follow the advice that’s been given to only have a treat very occasionally. Spiking your blood sugar on a frequent basis as a pre-diabetic can worsen insulin resistance and significantly increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and long-term complications. These complications can include serious damage to the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.",
