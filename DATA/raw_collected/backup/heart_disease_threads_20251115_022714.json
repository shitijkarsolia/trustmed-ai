That's awesome! \n\nYesterday was my son's birthday party, and I went stupid with the pizza and ate like 6 friggen slices from Dominos. I had a very stressful, unrestful night, and woke up feeling lightheaded and dissociative. My heart rate was lower than usual, pulse ox said my o2 was fine, then did another BP: First number was like 160/100, then after a few did it again and it lowered, but still averaging 150/95+\n\nI've been back on Losartan for a couple days now, but I missed yesterday. So I guess the questions are - Can a really bad meal cause these numbers today? Did the crummy sleep contribute to it? Is it rebound hypertension from a missed day? How did I get perfect numbers 2 days ago and now it's so much higher?",

Stress and anxiety raises bp, but systolic is much more easily changeable and responds quickly to the physical symptoms of stress and anxiety - fast heart rate, quickened breathing, etc - so systolic shoots right up. Diastolic is slower to move, so it doesn't respond to anxiety, which is usually a short term episode. If its high all the time, it can be secondary cause, but can also be sedentary lifestyle,  or being overweight. Either way, usually something more long term that your system is having to work harder to counter. 200/80 type of bp usually has a high heart rate and means they've taken it mid panic attack, 200/120 means you need a bunch of tests to find out what's out of whack.

Usually my diastolic actually is quite high, sometimes 100.  Then, the PCP ignores or says don’t worry, just keep to a more regular exercise routine. \n\nPrior readings at appts: 130/82, 134/82, 141/101, 132/95, 129/90, and there was one other time diastolic was 100 and my pulse pressure was around 30-35. \n\nThis summer I got scared and started keeping a log at home. \n\nIn the morning, following all or most suggested relaxation protocols, my readings are usually around 110/70-125/85. \n\nIn the afternoon, I’ll have spikes up to 140/100. When I’m anxious I’ll still have 135/85-95 in the evening even after sitting quietly, but the reading usually goes down. One time I got 151/100 but I immediately remeasured and it came back 135/80. \n\nI used to get angina (resting and with exercise) in college but was dismissed as anxiety when I tried bringing it up at the ER or with my PCP. They did an EKG and it came back normal. My bp at dr appts was in the 130/80s range but I was marathon training. \n\nI had my first heart palpitation two days ago; I wasn’t having an anxiety attack but I was generally quite worried all day and having a migraine while driving (furloughed fed with a monthlong migraine, hard not to be anxious lol). \n\nQ’s: Should I be freaking out like every nurse seems to? \n\n\nBe more insistent with my PCP that we explore medication or see a cardiologist?\n\n Am I just freaking myself out by taking it multiple times a day?

    "selftext": "So, recently while doing a blood pressure test, I saw my systolic was 140 and my dystolic was 80. Due to my job (I clean at a movie theater), time, and frankly laziness, I hadn't had the time to cook for myself, or exercise. I do go walks but I very regularly eat (or ate) at places kike McDonald's or a local fried chicken joint)\n\nNow this has been the case for a while, over a year, and only now I am dealing with issues, with chest pain and arm pains (although I have dealt with that prior as I have bad anxiety). Currently shopping for a meal that won't kill me, but since I have barely eaten anything in the past couple days, is it a bad idea to say fuck it and go get a burger? ",

When I dont care about salt intake Im 135/80 when I do Im 105/60 (on a lot of meds, cause I def have HPB)\n\nAnd fast food equals insane amounts of salt. Normal people should only have 6g of salt a day, people with HBP only 3g. The average person gets about 10-12g a day. Like one Big Mac is 42% of your daily salt. So thats without the fries and whatever else you order, plus all other food and surprisingly a fair few drinks a day. \n\nMost things baked are terrible as well salt. From 'healthy' bread to donuts. One donut, boom 1g of salt or more.",

Independent cardiologists often highlight that the *repeated micro-stimulation of the sympathetic system* is what wears down the heart over time, even if “no formal hypertension” is observed in the early studies.\n\n\n\n# Plain Language Summary\n\n* Yes, nicotine pouches raise blood pressure transiently.\n* Chronic use likely increases long-term cardiovascular risk modestly.\n* If you already have hypertension or anxiety, it’s a poor choice.\n* If your blood pressure is healthy and you’re using them occasionally, the risk is relatively small — **but not zero**.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! Some background on me I’m 37 yo had two children first child was the first time I was diagnosed with hypertension in pregnancy (27 years old at the time) was on meds during pregnancy delivered and did well getting off. During this though began my dread of the blood pressure machine… my second child I took baby aspirin and did not develop high enough BP to be put on medication I was 34 then. Every time I go to the doctors though my BP is high I need to breathe relax it finally lowers even at home I have a machine my first reading will be high up to 140+/90+ but then I breathe relax and I get a good reading… now to yesterday I had an appt at a new OBGYN in the waiting room an older woman was screaming and it honestly brought me back to my childhood almost like a PTSD thing bc she reminded me of my grandmother. I texted my husband omg my anxiety is through the roof. I go in they take my BP it’s 170/110 (I’ve never in my life had a high reading like that) they tell me you need to go to ER at first then finally say go home you look ok but see you PCP. I go home thinking it’ll go down and take it myself and it’s high so I did end up going to the ER - they did EKG kidney function test chest xray and heart blood test everything was great! They said it seems it’s asymptomatic hypertension induced by anxiety… \n\nMy question is this really if you made it this far if you were me on Tuesday at my PCP would you go in blood pressure medicine and if so what advice do you have? I’m so sick of this I honestly avoid doctors at this point… because of it I am going to attach a copy of the reading I generally get at home \n\n\n(More info if needed: I go to the gym 4-5 x a week for 1-1.5 hours, I eat mostly healthy but I am overweight even though I keep working out) ",

They’re near enough perfect across the board barring the odd one ridiculously close so I’d put it down to anxiety related as you’ve said.

All my labs look perfect besides a thyroid one that was off just 0.4. I don't know what else to do. I've spent the last few weeks just spiraling out of control just making it worse im sure.

(they keep repeating to make sure and there's nothing left), what can i possibly do? my AASI on ABPM peaked at 0.82 in 2024; it was 0.64 last time a few months ago and 0.34 in 2023; in general they ruled out an \\*inherent heart problem\\* not caused by my hypertension, so i'm just stumped. i've been posting about it all this time on my twitter account; and i'm hoping to make some friends here and perhaps learn more; because i'm stumped.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwq6so7b6s0g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055421b2b125d17d09545b7b41601b6e25e5b62f\n\nfunnily enough; if you see a few readings i took on my home monitor (i had it checked)...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjftsj6e6s0g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43dadf92e95a86b37a951031735eead4263aff40\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szr1h36f6s0g1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2824f1d186b49f399d7e01b21cdecfe2e2530a5a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oknian4g6s0g1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c4df1eda1f390339d80d5032dcc84225590d49\n\n...you may note that i contributed the photo for hypertensive crisis on wikipedia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqu7ev8l6s0g1.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae09fc32d2e66eb5aa2c3c35d410e356963b8d85\n\nalso, this reading's quite a bit more dubious as it was in an emergency setting and they obviously did not fit an arterial line, but around february 2025 it seemed my blood pressure rose above 300 systolic; given that no manual or automatic blood pressure cuff from numerous paramedic crews could read my BP; inflating to the max and then returning an error for the automatic ones, and inflating to the max on the manual ones and having the lead paramedic just go \"i hear the sounds; i don't know what it is but it's extremely high\"; i had rang for chest pain. i'm hoping also to make some friends in this community; thank you.\n\nmy main question is what could possibly be at play here? i less just want to yap about my experience and more find some answers and discuss perhaps anyone with a similar age to me (18) who may have similar experiences; so i know i'm not alone. thank you very much. i'm also willing to answer any questions. \\~ erika",

        "body": "Hi, and welcome.  So you're only on two low dose meds at the moment, and your weekly average is 190/107? Heart rate always tachycardia? Or is that just while at hospital? I'm just wondering why you're not on a beta blocker yet and couldn't see on your post.\n\nI used to average 245/160 long term, also malignant, had an eye stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy,  cardiomegaly,  lowered ejection fraction (51), thickened chamber walls, tachycardia,  a murmer,  and chronic kidney disease from hypertensive nephropathy.  For me, tests found it was caused by a kidney failing after severe and chronic hydronephrosis, itself caused by damage from a surgery 4 years before, had been misdiagnosed as a kidney infection so went untreated.  I'm also autistic, incidentally! I'm on 10mg amlodipine,  2.5mg bisoprolol and 50mg losartan and it's worked well, eventually, to bring my bp down and my heart rate reasonably normal. Due to the meds, my heart returned to normal size and function,  though still have a murmur, and after 2 years I was discharged from the retinal clinic with only a small but permanent blind spot in one eye. The kidney disease is stable. \n\nSo hopefully they'll get you on meds that work for you and lower your bp slowly. I started at a higher average than yours so your mileage may vary,  and because of the heart stuff they wanted to lower it very slow, so for me it took about 8 months of my rested averages dropping like 3-5 points every week! Frustrating, especially those weeks where it didn't drop or I'd  go back up again, but it got there eventually.  I was told that it was likely I'd been averaging around 245/160 for 'months or years' so it needs to lower slowly to avoid more strokes, and more damage, so it might be quicker or slower for you. I hope they get you sorted soon!",

Less than a week into adding Eplerenone 25mg to the Labethol I had been taking - I started to see results.\n\nMy typical BP is about 160/100.  After a few days of taking the meds, I saw it start to drop to 125/95.\n\nSounds good right?  Well here is my concern - the last few days I've been experiencing light headedness and dizzy spells.  I know this is a symptom of regulating BP.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am an NHS GP in the UK with a big interest in blood pressure. Over the years I have noticed how many people struggle not because they lack motivation, but because tracking and understanding their readings is made far more confusing than it needs to be.\n\nI have been working on a simple, free app to help people keep their readings in one place and understand the basics without any noise. No cost, no ads, no push for anything at all. It is just something I wanted to build after seeing so many people feel lost or stressed about their numbers.\n\nI am sharing it here because I would genuinely value honest feedback from people who actually live with hypertension every day. If something is helpful, great. If something is annoying or pointless, I want to hear that too. The whole point is to make it more useful over time.\n\nIf anyone wants to share thoughts on what makes tracking easier or harder, I would really appreciate it. I am also happy to answer general questions about blood pressure if that helps.\n\nHere is our download link on the apple app store, android coming soon :) [https://apple.co/4nPKN2D](https://apple.co/4nPKN2D)\n\nDr Adam, GP in the UK!

Was on Metoprolol for about 4 months, but horrible side effects for me, so they switched me over to Nebivolol then.  I'm taking it because of high blood pressure.  I wasn't very kind to my body growing up, and had a couple AFib episodes about 4-5 years ago.  The thing is, they only happened after I drank heavily or went on a bender, which I mentioned repeatedly to my cardiologist at the time. One episode, they had to put me under and do a cardioversion. My blood pressure was averaging 140 over something before the medication. \n\nNow, I've had hardly any side effects from it, except for two.  And that is a complete lack of sex drive.  To the point of being almost non-existent.  And it's starting to severely affect my relationship.  She feels like it's something to do with her, and she has every right to feel that way.  I would were the roles reversed.  And I've assured her that is not the case.  But has anyone else had this problem on Nebivolol?  To this extent?  The other problem is quality of sleep.  I always wake up every two hours or so for no reason.  Not debilitating, but has definitely affected sleep amounts and quality over the years.\n\nI also take baby aspirin and Atorvastatin.  Now, about 6 months ago, I decided to change my lifestyle completely.  100 percent sober, exercise 4 times a week, and eat clean and healthy.  My BP now averages 115-120 over something, but I'm also still on the Nebivolol.  \n\nI'm seriously thinking about quitting it.  \n\nFor anyone that is no longer on it, did your sex drive improve?  Back to what it was before you started taking it?  Did your BP remain stable with diet and exercise alone?  Did your sleep quality improve any?  Thank you in advance and much appreciated.",

It's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed to talk about and it's a VERY common side effect of beta blockers, even Nebivolol, so they've heard it all.\n\nI also found that my sleep quality was pretty bad on Nebivolol. I've found extended release melatonin or delta 8 helped me a lot, but that's up to you to decide what to take.\n\nAdditionally, if Nebivolol is working well for you, ask if Sildenafil or Tadalafil is an option for you. They can be taken with beta blockers without serious side effects if they are monitored with your doctor.",

So no - not all are placebo, but some are anxiety, and some will be other health issues which could also be causing the high bp - or even 'just' side effects from the lifestyle that could be causing the bp, too.

Sometimes I think people don’t share their positive results enough, and it can really skew people’s ideas of what medicating hypertension will be like. I put off getting medicated for 15 years.\n\nMy story was basically diagnosed with hypertension at age 20 and didn’t start taking medication until age 35. In between I tried a variety of things such as drinking large amounts of beat and celery juice, eating so little sodium a day that I was getting headache, and trying to run 5K daily to make my hypertension go away.\n\n140 systolic to start creeping up to 150 and higher. \n\nI was so hesitant to try medicine because I had heard like the side effects were terrible and it doesn’t actually you know fix the problem—which I don’t deny.\n\nSitting in the doctors office one day after yet another high reading, I shared with the doctor the list of supplements I was taking, and he was like: “What you are trying to achieve can be gotten with medicine. And these medicines have gone through clinical trials. Your supplements from the vitamin store have not.” Further more I had left ventricle hypertension from the years of not treating it.\n\nThis was about a year ago. 50mg of Losartan a year later I have it under control. I even took that reading at a Wal Mart blood pressure machine which typically would give me high readings. \n\nI was lucky to find success on the first medicine prescribed. The pill along with some increased exercise and giving up bacon—I used to eat daily—led me here. I encourage those on fence to get medicated to please think about it. \n\nWish all the best.\n\n ",

    "selftext": "For context, I’m 29 now. I was first put on BP medication (amlodipine + telmisartan) when I was 20. At that time, I was 95 kg, obese, living on junk food, drinking heavily, smoking daily around 15 cigs and my clinic BP readings were around 150/100. Even at rest it used to be 140/90 on both those meds.\n\nDuring COVID, I lost 40 kgs with exercise and a clean diet and dropped to 59 kgs. My BP at the doctor’s office became 100/60, I felt light-headed all the time, so my doctor stopped amlodipine and eventually stopped all BP meds. This was after around 6 years of using them.\n\nSoon after, my BP started going up again (around 140/90), so telmisartan 40 mg was added back. For the next \\~3 years, even though I drank and smoked on weekends (12 beers + 1 pack of cigarettes sometimes), my in clinic BP stayed stable — usually 110/80 to 120/80. I felt completely fine. Never checked at home as i didnt have any obsessions about health. Even during severe headaches it barely went above 130. I had always been anxious but i was drinking a strong starbucks coffee as soon as i used to wake up which was causing severe palpatations and sweating all over. I thought why not check my bp in the morning but it was always great so i stopped and threw the machine away. i was frustrated. I was told that headaches are caused by high bp and i was sitting with perfectly normal bp even after a night of heavy drinking lol. I also continued exercising everyday.\n\nIn October 2023 everything changed. After a night of heavy drinking, I had my first panic attack — HR racing, BP at the hospital was \\~200, they gave me 0.25 mg clonazepam and within 30 mins it dropped to 120. That event triggered severe health anxiety.\n\nAt that time, I was also under major stress (job issues + relationship breakup). At the cardiologist’s clinic my BP was 146/92, echo and ECG were normal, but she still advised increasing telmisartan to 80 mg. I refused because I knew it was anxiety — just a few days before, while travelling in Bangkok, my BP was 120/70.\n\nThen I made the mistake of buying a BP machine. I checked repeatedly — first reading was 130, then 140, then 160, and by the fourth check it was 180. Panic → ER → normal tests → sent home. And this cycle repeated almost daily. I moved back to my parents’ house because of fear.\n\nSince then I’ve had:\n\n* 3 normal echocardiograms\n* 300+ normal ECGs\n* Normal kidney/liver function, thyroid, cortisol, electrolytes\n* Normal renal doppler, CT calcium score = 0\n* Normal TMT (12.7 METs), HbA1c 5.0, fasting sugar 85\n* Normal urinary metanephrines (so no pheochromocytoma)\n* hsCRP 0.1, no inflammation\n\nEvery ER visit was the same: BP 170–190/110, mild anti-anxiety med → BP drops to \\~140 → ECG is normal → discharge.\n\nLast year I started paroxetine. Within a month, my BP averaged 115/60, lowest was 110/49. But I stopped it because my obsession with checking BP didn’t stop. Then panic returned.\n\nNow what’s scaring me is: even when I’m calm, my BP has been around 132–135 systolic for the last few days. My doctor told me to stop checking it, but my whole body feels tense and I can’t tell whether it’s anxiety or actual high BP returning. In the morning however it was 115/65.

I thought I was gonna die. I was checking my BP and first reading was 160/80 which made thing worse. \n\nMy doctor at the time was a young doctor who had no experience with LIFE. She had experience with pills, medications and statistics. And new guidelines and borderlines for BP. So she gave me a strong dose of a combination pill called Amcandin (Amlodipine 10 mg and Candesartan (that I used before) 16 mg (double dose)) without asking what I do for myself, for my work or anything life related.\n\nEager to find a solution I started to use my watch daily and check my heart rate. Not a good idea. It worsened everything. I thought everything over 75 was going to kill me.\n\nThe medication also took life from me. Like literally, I wasn't the same, constantly tired, on the verge of passing out. But my BP average was 150/85.\n\nSo after a month of suffering and occasional drinking/smoking I decided to lower my alcohol intake/smoking, start eating healthier. Bought an exercise bike. Beetroot juice. Fish 3 times a week. No fast food, low fats, almost 0 salt. \n\nFor anxiety I took some natural based pills that you can buy in the pharmacy but are natural, non-addictive and cannot do anything else except relax you and your mind. I felt stoned and barely productive so after 3 weeks of using, I stopped. It kind of helped me sleep though. But I used that (still do) a lavender spray for pillows and sheets. Works wonders.\n\nBP remained high so I decided to take my health to a new, unknown level and went to a psychotherapist. Even though I spent much more money that I thought (4 sessions, 300€) I got some guidelines, that's it. I stopped therapy after 4 sessions because I had a feeling they wanted to maximize money take from me without providing too much help. Which confirmed after trying with 2 other psychotherapists. I wanted to work with something and all I got from them are questions, not guidelines or help, not even recommended books!\n\nWent to my cardiologist (somehow I got to him 3 months after last visit, even though I have a regular, 2 year check up) and he said \"you're a slave to your BP. Measure 1 or 2 times a week (more if it's high as hell, like over 160/90) but only in the morning and make sure you rest 10 minutes before, no eating 30 mins befre, etc. etc. you know the drill. You're clearly overdosed, we're gonna halve this amlodipine and go from there\"",

What helped me was a doctor at the ER who literally told me: \"You don't belong here and you're distracting our work with patients that really need us. I don't want to see you here again.\" This was a pivotal moment for me, I got my things soon sorted out.\n\nThat it goes up to 200 in a panic attack is not something unexpected. If you run up a steep hill with full effort it will be also in that range or even higher. What matters is how it is first thing in the morning and in the evening before you go to sleep. That being said I have much higher readings than you have when your readings are regular. I don't like what I see, but for that I have a GP to work with.\n\nPlease stop measuring that often. Get help with your anxiety/panic attacks and you likely will be fine. You're still young and enjoy the sportive activities you do. My fingers are crossed for you. 🙏",

For example, in the morning it is around 120/80, then throughout the day and in the early evening it is always around 140/80, and then in the evening, after I have relaxed for a while, it is back to around 120/80. I also notice that when I take several measurements in a row, my blood pressure drops by about 10-15. Should I have this checked by a doctor? Is it normal for blood pressure, especially systolic blood pressure, to be slightly higher during the day? I am 27 years old, do not smoke, and do not drink regularly. All in all, I would say that I have a relatively healthy lifestyle.\n\nThank you in advance!",

During those two years I lost 26lbs, reduced nicotine (from 120mg/day to 12mg/day) and caffeine (from 300mg/day to 40-60mg/day), and stuck to a low sodium diet. \n\nI was prescribed this because I went to the ER for a panic attack and they noticed my BP was 160/120 when I was there. \n\nWent to the doctor for my annual checkup a little over a week ago and they bumped me to 5mg after seeing that my numbers (also during a panic attack) were 150/92. \n\nLong story short I feel like the walking dead on the new dose. I’m sleeping at least 12 hours a day, and I have to drink crazy amounts of water to produce a normal amount of pee. I’m very rarely hungry and I often don’t notice that I’m hungry until I’m passing out from lack of food. I’ve also noticed that after orgasm my vision goes fucky and my chest feels sort of weird (not painful) for the rest of the day. \n\nMy resting BP (semi-reclined, under weighted blanket) on the new dose is 116/64. I don’t know exactly how I’m supposed to take it but that’s how they take it when I’m at the ER. I do it this way because without the weighted blanket my adrenaline will skyrocket and that affects my readings. Before I started doing this, about 75% of my readings were taken during panic attacks. \n\nOther conditions I have: severe panic disorder (8-9 panic attacks per day on average), TRT induced polycythemia, Klinefelter syndrome. \n\n",

        "body": "It's probably important to understand what these numbers mean.  The top number (systolic) is the pressure exerted when the heart pumps blood into the body.  The bottom number (diastolic) is essentially the \"baseline\" pressure of the circulatory system.  BP will shift and change constantly, with activity of any sort raising the pressure (both numbers) to support the activity.  This is done by the body's parasympathetic nervous system, it's literally what makes you function.\n\nTreatment of blood pressure is a game of averages, not peaks.  A non-hypertensive person will certainly have (much) higher than \"normal\" values under stress or activity, but that's a peak.  (Nor is it dangerous long term.)  If you average these readings over time and during periods of rest, you're just barely at the point where treatment is usually desirable.  Most doctors will refrain from treatment, due to the potential for medication issues, until its clearly necessary.  Furthermore, home based units can also be inaccurate.  (Many units provide a 3x test and provide an average, which help rule out errant tests.)",

Reading other peoples success stories gives me hope, a lot of the time their BP goes back to normal levels.\n\nI know not everyone can just ask/request for a random CT scan, but if you have other symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and joint pain, then I would ask your doctor to check your cortisol levels.

I’ve had high blood pressure almost my entire life and have been on hypertension medicine since I was 18, but recently it had become a much bigger issue. My readings were consistently in the 150–160/100–110 range.\n\nAbout three months ago, I had a colonoscopy. That evening, I developed severe stomach pain that sent me to the emergency room. I think something I ate may have triggered it, since they had removed some polyps, my stomach was probably irritated, which caused the extreme pain. During that ER visit, they did a CT scan and discovered a noncancerous tumor on my adrenal gland.\n\nAfter that, I followed up with my internist, who referred me to both an endocrinologist and a nephrologist. They diagnosed me with primary aldosteronism and started me on spironolactone, and finally, my blood pressure came down to a normal range. For now, my doctors say I don’t need to have the tumor removed, but it’s something I might consider in the future. They also ruled out Cushing’s syndrome.\n\nIt’s wild, if I hadn’t had that CT scan, I would’ve never known the tumor was even there.",

Seems like I got a record of +140 everytime I've gone and that day I got 155/82.\n\nThe doctor prescribed me enalapril 20mg/day. The reason was because I have low risk factors:\n- Healthy bodyweight and body fat\n- Exercise 5-7 days/week\n- Healthy food habits (95% home cooking, no sodas only water, etc)\n- No smoking\n- Occasionally drink (couple beers every 1-2 months)\n\nThat night he asked me to take 20mg, wait about 20min and check my BP (went down to 143/80).\n\nLater in the middle of the night, I suddenly woke up with my left arm tingling, feeling kinda tight and feeling odd (hard to describe, I guess like anxious). Didn't say anything to my wife, dealt with it for an hour and somewhat got back to sleep. Never in my life I've felt any of that\n\nNext day I went to pick up the pills, and I though better start taking them the next day to start in the morning and didn't want to experience the same thing if it had something to do with the pill. Nothing happen that night, slept good as usual.\n\nThe next day (yesterday) I took the first pill at 6:55AM. Went about my day, went a couple times to the clinic to check my BP (+150s again), they told me it takes about a week to start seeing a change (kinda inconsistent from what the doctor told me).\n\nThat night it happen again, woke up around 1:45AM. This time felt it a little more, more tight around my upper left chest and armpit, and some cold feeling around my arm as well. Right arm completely normal. And the most concerning thing was my heart beat was very slow and inconsistent like \". . _ . _ . . _ .\"\n\nCalled 911 and they told me an ambulance was on its way. They didn't show up, because according to them I'm not in immediate danger. This is public system it what it is. Around 3AM from being up it, the feelings went away and got back to sleep a little.\n\nI'm not taking it anymore until I speak with a cardiologist later today.\n\nHas someone ever experienced something like this?",

I have been seeing a cardiologist for my heart rate (not BP) issues, but over the past year my blood pressure has truly shot through the roof and caused a more pertinent issue for me. If I sit for a good 5 minutes and relax, it tends to be about 155/117 or so, but often throughout the day it is over 160/120.\n\nMy cardiologist's NP prescribed me amlodipine at 2.5mg a day, and told me it probably would not start lowering my BP for at least a week. My BP did not lower at all that week, as expected. Exactly one week after starting the med I woke up at 5:30 in the morning to my bones, muscles, joints, and skin aching. It felt like I had a bad flu, except I didn't feel sick or rundown at all, just in pain. \n\nCalled the dr, they said it's not an emergency, but I can stop taking the med if I want to. Um, yeah. I wouldn't keep taking it if they told me I had to. Anyway, I usually took it at like 1pm, but I skipped that day's dose, and the next day (today) I feel much, MUCH better.\n\nI just wanted to post this out to the internet because I know that it's a supposedly rare side effect, and some of my googling showed me people developing mild joint pain after over a year on the medication. I don't know if I would have even put the two and two together if I had been taking to so long. So here is my story, up for anyone who googles something similar. I do not mean this as a warning not to take it, definitely try it, but if you experience these side effects, it's not a coincidence and you aren't the first!\n\nAnother thing that I might have as a side effect of amlodipine is mouth ulcers (canker sores). I occasionally have one, but over the past week I have had two plus one developing. In the stuff I have read, mouth ulcers are actually a more common side effect of this drug than muscle/joint pain, and especially skin pain. Anyway, that's what I've been dealing with, and I would love to hear about other experiences on this medication, good or bad.",

Studies showing that many people get most accurate readings when seated 25 minutes first, but obviously we don't often get time for that. Have a read of the wiki here, it's got lots of info about accurate readings and so on. Good luck!",

    "selftext": "So like most of you I've been on medication a few years and I was determined to not be. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was the final push so I lost the weight (around 25kg or 55lbs) it was enough to bring my BP right down at the time I was on 10mg amlodipine and 2.5mg indapamide. I tapered off the amlodipine with the guidance of my gp at the time and it's been about a year. I carried on the indapamide as my BP was in a really good place and side effects were minimal. In the past few months my BP was getting too low again so random dizziness and the odd headache. I started tapering off the indapamide to try and prevent rebound as I tried once before but went cold turkey and my BP bounced to 160/90 in a few days. This time Ive been up and down a bit but used information from studies about diuretic withdrawal and got AI to make me a plan. I've followed it and my last dose was on the 28th of October. As of yesterday I'm finally in a normal range with a little bit of instability which should settle after a few more days. While indapamide was a great drug for controlling my BP I started getting a lot of rashes (I used to have eczema) so that was my deciding factor indapamide has also become hard to get hold of in the UK so I didn't want to get to the point of just running out. Attached is my graph of the past week or so and as you can it's been a bit up and down. So I wanted to give a bit of hope to others who don't have genetically enforced hypertension that you can resolve and get off medication... Obviously not the same for everyone but don't get comfy on medication if you don't need to be!\n",

        "body": "I completely agree with you — I’m a doctor, and what I always tell my patients is this: in the textbooks, the very first thing we read when it comes to managing any comorbidity, whether it’s hypertension or diabetes, is to guide the patient toward lifestyle changes. When we notice that the condition is more advanced or that the patient lacks the initial discipline, we start medication, because we need to prevent further damage to the body.\n\nBut the greatest gift is when a patient manages to change their lifestyle and decides they don’t want to depend on medication. That’s truly powerful. However, as others have said, the transition must be appropriate, controlled, and continuously evaluated — since medication helps regulate various body responses that lower blood pressure, and sometimes it takes a while for its effects to wear off.\n\nI always suggest this to people — I already have 13 Reddit users registered on my blood pressure tracking platform, which I created specifically for my hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients (including those in remission or those with a family history who want to stay alert). I’d like to invite you to join the platform as well, because beyond tracking your numbers, it helps guide your habits and gives you a much more accurate understanding of what you’re doing right — and what you’re not. You can even select whether you’re hypertensive or not, and the goals will automatically adjust. The link is in my bio — I’d love for you to check it out later.\n\nMy suggestion for you: maintain the habits you’ve built — the mindset of change is powerful. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, and if possible, always monitor your sleep quality and stress levels. Do physical activities in zone 2 or zone 3, then assess your VO₂ max, always aiming to increase and make it more efficient. This is extremely helpful for achieving a better and more effective reduction in blood pressure.\n\nBut congratulations already on the progress you’ve made!",

If you spike at the doctors due to anxiety, doesn’t matter - just do it at home and record it. The BP that matters is RESTING BP. Having high BP when moving around is totally normal. \n\n2) people don’t like meds because: \n- maybe side effects\n- may prevent you eating/drinking some stuff (grapefruit, alcohol)\n- you’ll have to remember to take them and it’s a bother \n- you have to pay attention not to run out of the meds, plus cost for meds\n- if you want more babies then you probably have to switch to less effective meds for pregnancy \n- it means you have a chronic health condition that is controlled with meds. I think many people want to be “cured”, and not take meds. \n\nIf you are ok with meds for the rest of your life, then I guess you’re fine. \n\nNB: the 120/80 guidelines were for men. So some research suggests it should be even lower for women. But this is still new because duh, most research is done about men. Suggested preliminary guidelines for women (under 40 years) I think is something like 110/70. So I just take this as “don’t worry if meds are working too well” (unless it’s even lower than 100/60 and you get dizzy, which might be too low BP).",

I came here to look for outer opinions on something I have been suffering for a few weeks. About a month ago I had to go to the ER because my BP was at 195/138 P at 150 and being honest this scared me shitless. I don't know what exactly triggered this but my theory is bad eating habits + sedentary life + very bad sleep hygiene .Since then I have been taking Amlodipine 5, HZ 12.5 and Irbersartan 300 and my BP has been consistently low except for my pulse that sometimes is on the low 100s and have been eating better and walking. \n\nNow the thing is, since the episode I get anxiety for EVERYTHING related to doing exercise or getting intimate with my partner, thinking of the worst. I dont know what to do about this especially since I get fatigue sometimes while walking or doing some lifting doing chores at home.\n\nHave someone been through this? Anyone has tips?

I’ve done a LP(a) lab and that came back totally fine, which is great. Did a heart CT, stress test, Holter monitor, checked for renal stenosis, and an echo. All came back great. I work out 5-6 times per week doing both strength and cardio (biking well over 30 miles per week at the gym at a resistance of 7.) I eat well and watch my sodium. Caffeine stays well below 200mg/ day and is fine with my cardiologist. We did a medication adjustment back in March or so after some weird top number readings for a while and since then my readings had been great. The last 3ish weeks I’ve gotten weird bottom number readings and now into top and bottom being weird (mostly mid to high 80s into 90s.) My cardiologist has been out sick as I’ve been keeping in check with them and we even double checked that my monitor is accurate as I take my pressure every day. I’ve managed my medical anxiety and take all my meds as I’m suppose to, take my readings according to AHA standards, and I’ve lost about 18lbs so far. VERY mild sleep apnea to the point I hardly qualify as having it (and they did the test when I was sick so they’re not even sure if I do have it as results may have been skewed.) \n\nIm on 50mg metoprolol er and 60mg nifedipine er/ day (taken in the morning with 24 oz water) and take my reading 2 hours after meds as I’m told to by my doctor yet my readings the last 3 weeks are still abnormally high.\n\nAny ideas on why this might be happening or things I could ask my doctor about to figure this out?\n\nTYA!

Within the past 3 weeks I started to get headaches and decided to take a BP reading with my portable monitor (one that my doctor checked out a few years ago).  The reading was high, as in 175 over 111 high.  I have clonidine to take for when it gets 160 over 100 and I began taking that every 6 hours.  My BP would only go down to the 150 over 90 range but would constantly average 160 over 100.  \n\nI made the earliest appointment for a doctor's visit a week after that.  In between I checked out 3 other blood pressure monitors and they all read pretty much the same thing.  Averaging around 160 over 100 after taking all of my medicine.  It would go as high as 170 over 110 if I went too long in between doses and it was also that high in the morning before I took any medicine.\n\nToday was my doctor's visit.  During the visit we took readings on my portable monitor and on his portable monitor.  Both were 160 over 100.  However, the doctor and the NP both took manual readings and were VERY sure that my BP was actually 130 over 80.  \n\nWhat is going on here?  Why is every portable monitor I'm using showing one thing while manual is showing another?",

    "selftext": "EDIT: This is my question. Does anyone here who is on meds for blood pressure have a prescription that says \"take one tablet a day, but on days that you feel anxious or your BP is reading higher, take two\"? This is how my PCP wants me to manage some recent BP spikes / higher readings. I have never heard of using BP meds that way - I thought the idea was to take the same amount at the same time every day in order to keep the medication consistent in your bloodstream - and I'm trying to decide whether to comply or to get a second opinion from a different doctor. Please share your experience if you have any that relate. Thank you!\n\nTLDR version: First, some background and the story that leads to my post. 62YO female, diagnosed with hypertension in Nov. 2024. PCP started me on 50 mg of daily Losartan-HCTZ at that time. Other than some fluctuating BP readings the first couple of weeks, BP quickly stabilized and my weekly morning readings have been in a consistently good range for the past year: typically, around 110/70 on the average. In addition, I have improved my diet and increased my exercise, losing roughly 20 pounds in the process so that I'm now in the high end of a \"normal\" weight range for my height.\n\nThe story is that everything was going well until a couple of days ago. Out of the blue, while I was sitting quietly and working on the computer, I got a late afternoon nosebleed. Nothing to be alarmed about except I really have \\*never\\* had one, so it did scare me. I leaned forward and pinched the soft part of my nose until the bleeding stopped about 20 minutes later, at which time my husband suggested that I check my blood pressure, having read that a nosebleed + high BP could be a warning sign of artery blockage. My reading was 175/93. Retook in other arm and it was 182/95. Sat quietly for 15 minutes and tried to relax, then retook. Third reading was 181/98.\n\nI didn't like the trend, esp. in the diastolic which was higher than I'd ever seen it, and it was 6 PM on Sunday evening so my PCP was not available, so we decided to go to the ED. In the couple of hours I was there for observation, my BP started to come down. The nurse told us they see this all the time when people become resistant to the dosage of meds they are on and need an adjustment. Granted, also, I was very scared, and I know that was affecting my BP readings. They released me with instructions to follow up with my PCP, which I did yesterday. (By yesterday morning my BP had returned to normal. I've since had a couple more nosebleeds, not accompanied by very high BP like the first time, but still higher than I'm used to.)\n\nWhat this post is about is what my PCP has told me to change: to continue taking one dose of Losartan / day, \\*except\\* on days when I know I'm going to be stressed or I see high BP readings. On those days I should take two doses of Losartan.\n\nHas anyone heard of managing BP this way? I thought the goal was to have a consistent amount of medication in your bloodstream at all times, and wonder if \"some days taking two\" could cause my BP to be more erratic overall and lead to unwanted side effects.\n\nI would love to hear from you if your doctor is managing your BP the way my doctor wants to, or if you know the answer to my question. I've spent the past day trying to find anything to read that supports this idea and have come up empty. At this point I'm just not convinced it is safe to do what my doctor is advising, but I am open to changing my mind.\n\nThanks for reading and for sharing any experience you have in this area.",

        "body": "Look, that’s exactly what you said — most guidelines usually recommend starting medication and observing the patient’s response while they also begin lifestyle changes.  \nJust increasing the dose whenever blood pressure rises isn’t something I’ve ever seen recommended in any guideline, and it overlooks a few important things:\n\n1. Is there a recurring factor that’s preventing proper control, even with the usual medication?\n2. When the patient is making healthy lifestyle changes, is it really necessary to increase the dosage?\n3. Or even… is the patient showing the same blood pressure values when daily habits improve? Or slightly lower readings, even with the regular prescribed dose (just one tablet)?\n\nBlood pressure control involves many details. Simply increasing the number of pills might “work,” but it treats the **numbers**, not the **person**. We have to go beyond that.\n\nThere are a few people here and on Discord using my blood pressure monitoring platform — it actually includes these kinds of details and really helps to understand where adjustments can be made. There’s an English version too, so feel free to use it if you’d like. The link is in my profile.\n\nBut yeah, increasing the dose just because the pressure goes up doesn’t make much sense to me.\n\nTake care!",

Due to my already HBP the Endo didnt want me to do the Salt Test and instead jumped right to taking the Eplerenone.\n\nThe Endos rational was that if I did have Aldosterone glands over producing then the combination of these drugs would see \"near instantaneous\" improvements in my BP.\n\nThoughts about this approach and about taking both drugs at once?\n\n",

You certainly could still have one-sided hyperaldosteronism even without anything showing on the CT scans. Your doctor is right that if you do have hyperaldosterism taking eplerenone should help you immensely and relatively quickly (a few weeks), but then you are stuck on the medicine and any tests that you try to take will be tainted by it, including an adrenal vein sampling which is the gold standard for one-sided hyperaldosteronism isn't that can be treated with surgery. \n\nThe labetalol also can interfere with your renan test which is needed to figure out read and aldosterone ratio. That's probably why your doctor said just try the medicine and see if it helps. You could at least take a 24-hour urine aldosterone before starting. I don't know what you should do.

    "selftext": "Backstory:\nMy husband had a stroke in 2021. His blood pressure during the stroke was extremely high, obviously. He was put on Amlodapine and baby aspirin. Well,about a year ago, his (new) doctor took him off the Amlodapine. For a while, his BP was stable. However, last week, his BP spiked while at work. They sent him home. I was late for work that day and, as soon as I heard what his BP was, I rushed him to the ER. He maxed out at 210/133 and docs couldn't get it down. Turns out, he has resistant hypertension. MRI showed two additional minor strokes that could have been much worse. He's now on 5 BP meds and a low sodium diet.\n\nThe Question:\nThe problem is, he eats like a picky toddler. I can list the vegetables he will eat and he LIVED for processed foods (think frozen meals and food, boxed side dishes, etc.) and fast food. Trust me, I know it's immature, but if he even THINKS that I put a vegetable in his food -- or if a vegetable touched his food during the cooking process -- he will claim he can taste it and he won't eat it. He loves Italian food and meat/potatoes. So, I need some recipes that I can make that ARE NOT BLAND, but also don't include a lot of stuff that he just won't eat.  Below is a list of what he WILL eat:\n\nVegetables:\nIceberg lettuce \nCucumber\nMushrooms\nPotatoes\nGreen Beans\nCorn\n\nMeat:\nChicken\nGround Beef\nSteak\nTuna Fish (RARELY EATS)\nHot Dogs (can't eat now)\nKielbasa (can't eat now)\nSausage (can't eat now)\nHam (can't eat now)\n\nDairy:\nMilk\nCheddar, Mozzarella, Parmesan cheese\nCottage Cheese (RARELY EATS)\nRicotta Cheese\n\nCarbs:\nPasta (and NOT whole wheat, veggie, or protein pasta)\nWhite Bread\nPotato Bread\nRolls (hamburger, hot dog, Kaiser rolls)\nCrescent rolls\n\nIf you have to get a little sneaky with vegetables in your recipes, that's okay! I just want him to get healthy!\n\nBONUS:\nThanksgiving recipes would be great too? Our normal spread consists of candied ham (he won't eat turkey), Parmesan garlic mashed potatoes, Italian style green beans (fresh green beans marinated in Italian dressing), homemade macaroni and cheese, stuffing (he won't eat), and crescent rolls. Any HEALTHY substitution recipes would be AMAZING!!!!\n",

Also I recommend Trader Joe's coffee rub if you have a store nearby.  It's low sodium and does a good job with meats on the grill.\n\nJust my personal thoughts - you have more chance of success if you approach this gradually.  Going cold turkey might be more likely to lead to failure.  For example, I don't worry about the occasional dinner out or holiday.  I still try to make good choices, but too much denial can backfire.  \n\nGood luck.  I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!",

Not disastrous but I've done everything possible to lower manually and these levels were same as before medication.\n\nI had all clear ECG, excellent bloods bar one reading. So nurse put me on 36 hour BP watch to rule out white coat and average was slightly higher. So he upped me to 7.5 for 2 weeks.\n\nPost 2 weeks of 50% and no difference on readings, in fact pulse dropped to 42 from usual 45-48 average. (I am quite fit but not sure I'm that fit!!)\n\nSo referred back to Docs and he put me on double to 10mg Ramipril for a month and booked bloods in 2 weeks to ensure ok, and echo on heart (that's later today). Been on these 7 days now and my BP is now 150/105 so what on Earth is going on. Feel like reverse is happening!\n\nWill update post echo later.\n\nEDIT: Echo went ok. Obviously they couldn't commit as they need to officially measure and write a report but he mentioned off the record nothing to worry about. Thanks for all the replies, think I will suggest a change of medicine to see if that is an option.",

        "body": "I can definitely relate to the stress and uncertainty you're feeling right now. My father went through something similar a few years ago, and I remember how scared and helpless we all felt. The constant worry about his health, the unanswered questions, and that nagging feeling of \"what if\" weighed on us heavily. But thankfully, preventative scanning ended up playing a huge role in his recovery.\n\nHe was in his mid-50s and, like you, started experiencing odd symptoms of chest pain, cold limbs, and general discomfort. He brushed it off at first, thinking it was just stress or fatigue from work. But the symptoms didn’t go away, and after some convincing from our family, he decided to get a heart scan. Thankfully, he did.\n\nThe scan showed that he had a blockage in one of his arteries, something none of us had expected. He wasn’t diagnosed with anything serious yet, but the early discovery of this blockage meant we could act before it became a full-blown heart attack. His doctors were able to start treatment right away, putting him on medication and adjusting his lifestyle to reduce his risks. The whole thing really opened our eyes to how important these preventative tests are, especially when the symptoms are there but nothing seems immediately wrong on the surface.\n\nThe scan was a turning point it helped prevent something much worse from happening. He’s been doing great ever since, and it was all thanks to catching the issue early. Seeing how much a simple scan changed his life has made me more proactive about my own health too.\n\nI hope your results give you the answers and relief you're looking for and just know that you're not alone in this. Early detection can make all the difference!",

It was so intense that I gotten up and ran to get my phone. Called 911 and ended up in the ER all day doing blood work and troponin. Everything's fine. Today same thing but watching TV. Sweating a little bit not sure if it's anxiety or not. I called my cardiologist after hours. Some guy called me back and told me as if I will die and need to go to the ER. Issue is. Ice Strom and nothing I can do and the ambulance wouldn't even take me to the heart hospital. They just take you to the nearest one and mine nearest one is so so unprofessional. From 2 days ago to today 3 days. I still can workout with no issue so I'm not sure what's going on. Had stress echogram. X-ray November and troponin on January 21st and 25th.

        "body": "Definitely recommend asking your doc to confirm. \n\nThe report's mention of a small area of thickening on one part of the aortic valve could be due to mild calcification (a common process where calcium builds up in body tissues, including the heart), it's not significantly affecting the valve's function right now, as indicated by the normal motion.\n\nThe overall context of these findings suggests that there is no significant heart valve dysfunction, and no immediate signs of endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves or the inner lining of the heart. Endocarditis also generally comes with other symptoms, like fever, chills, fatigue, chest discomfort. Assuming you don't have any of these symptoms, that’s likely why no immediate follow-up is required and you've been instructed to return in 6 months to 1 year, just to ensure that there’s no progression of the calcification or other emerging heart issues.\n\nAgain, I would recommend discussing these results in detail with your doctor to get a complete understanding, particularly about why endocarditis was mentioned, and to find out whether there are any specific lifestyle modifications or monitoring that you should follow in the meantime. In general monitoring your BP at home is never a bad idea, since BPs measured in an office are sometimes higher (or less often, lower) than they are at home. \n\n  \nAMA/AHA has good instructions on how to get a good reading: [https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf)",

I am looking for advice from others who are in the same situation or medical professionals. Let me list down my thought process below - \n\nI'm an Indian male, 42 years old. Slightly overweight (5'9\", 83 kgs). Over the last few years I have tried to lead a physically active lifestyle that includes at least 6-7 hours of exercise weekly, including cardio and weight training. My diet mostly comprises of home cooked Indian meals (rice, chappatis, pulses, legumes, and green veggies, with occasional chicken and eggs. I'm also a social drinker (1-2 drinks per week).\n\nI have a family history of heart disease (Both grandfathers, my father, and elder brother (49 years old) have had heart attacks). \n\nI get an annual blood work done and my LDL remains stubbornly high at about 100-120 even though I mostly eat healthy and workout. Triglycerides are below the threshold. Blood pressure is normal. I dont have any other risk factor like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, blood sugar and smoking etc. \n\nI consulted a physician recently after my brother got a heart attack. And he suggested that I immediately get on a daily regimen of statins (10mg). \n\nMy biggest hesitancy about statins is that I dont want to take a drug for the rest of my life if there is no major risk for me. I feel any drug has its short term and long term side effects. For example, statins are known to cause Type 2 diabetes in some patients. I would like to stay away from any such unintended side effects. \n\nI'm sure there are others like me wrestling with this situation. It would be very helpful to hear your point of view and your experience with statins, if any. Thanks!",

I stood up in fear tried to take a deep breath and wash my face and then i got hit by the third one, it felt like being punched by a professional boxer, it knocked me to the ground, for a couple seconds i couldnt hear or see anything, i got up and i was sort of limping bc my legs were really stiff and failing, i went to my girlfriend and said that i needed to go to the hospital right now no questions asked, on the way i could feel my heart rate going through the roof and down the floor within seconds of each other, i honestly tought i was dying. In the hospitol they took my pressure , it was a little high, and did an ecg and it was normal, they pumped me with sedatives and i blacked out and was sent home the following morning when i woke up. \n\nThis happened for 3 days straight, the it stopped. But since it happened it changed me, now on some days when im trying to sleep and am just about to fall asleep i feel a shock/chill on my heart , it feels like my heart stops for a single second. I also get random heart palpitations, chest pains, night sweats,  anxiety and i feel very tired. If i consume an above average amount of alcohol my heart goes into afib on the next day. If a have an adrenaline rush i feel a very sharp pain in my chest and if i drink any amount of caffeine i have arrhythmia.\n\nI've been to a cardiologist who did exams and said everythign was fine with my heart.\n\nI've been to a shrink who said it was a panic disorder and gave me an anxiolytic prescription, but im not convinced.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Should i got to another heart doctor? Should i go to a neurologist? I'll appreaciate any input, this is deteriorating my life quality as time goes by and idk what to do",

It truly felt like it was eminating from my stomach and somehow the EKG in the ER did not show it as heart related. They gave me stomach meds and pain killers and sent me home. My primary care doctor figured out what was going on when he did an EKG and results clearly said HEART ATTACK.\n\nRegards and feel better",

This is what you should expect:\n\nYou may get prescribed something for your anxiety. I'd recommend trying a little bit of it before the day of the test so you can see how you handle it. You have to be aware enough to hold your breath during certain times.\n\nYou will go in, get changed, and they will put an IV in your arm. They will likely inject you with a liquid beta blocker because your HR needs to be 60 bpm or less for the test. They may inject you with it up to three times if your HR is stubborn.\n\nThey will test out the contrast by injecting a little bit to see if you're allergic. Tell them if you have any side effects.\n\nThey will take pictures without contrast. Then they will have you take a medication orally to dialte your veins. Then they will inject the contrast into your IV. You should tell them if you feel funny after it but you probably will feel fine. You may think you've peed yourself after the injection.\n\nYou must stay completely still as they are doing the test or else you can mess up the images. You literally can't even move a finger or toe.\n\nThe entire test will be pretty short. Then you probably shouldn't drive. In my experience the beta blocker and anti-anxiety med combo really messed me up.",

Usually they go away within a couple of minutes but I did have one bad episode where my heart didn't beat right for a whole evening and didn't get back to normal until I'd been to sleep. In hindsight I should have gone to hospital but I was in denial about what was going on.\n\nI managed to catch the latest occurrence on my fitbit charge 5. I think the really big peaks are from where I wasn't sat still enough but you can see extra beats around 6s and 14s and other places.\n\nOther symptoms I have is heavy lifting causes chest pains (angina?) and spasm like feelings around my heart (but they don't show up on ECG). If I've had a bad day I often feel like my heart is beating quite hard (but not fast) when I'm at rest, to the point where lying on my left side or front when trying to sleep isn't possible as I can feel my heart beating so much. Jogging and hiking feel good though and don't seem to worsen it. \n\nI've seen doc and cardiologists blood tests and ECG done and they say they can't pick anything up. Not had echocardiagram yet, then that's next step. This has been going on for a couple of months and I would love to know what's wrong with me",

He sent me for testing at my local cardiac clinic. I did a Holter monitor overnight and stress test. All results came back negative. All good, clean bill of health.\n\nFast forward to just over a month ago. I noticed that I was getting this weird \"ploomf\" sensation in my chest very occasionally instead of a normal heartbeat. I don't know how to describe it--sort of an odd feeling, like the heart did not beat 100% correctly for that moment. It wasn't a series of weird heartbeats in quick succession or anything like that...just, every now and then, I'd notice this odd \"off\" heartbeat for a moment. As if I was having a weird kind of palpitation. When it happens, I can literally feel it beat slightly \"weird\" if I have my hand placed on my chest over my heart.\n\nMy memory could be wrong, but I feel like I remember having this happen in the past, many years ago, and it would go away of its own accord pretty quickly.\n\nAnyway, back to the present: it persisted for a couple of weeks, then went away for a week, then came back again. I decided to go to the doctor (a different one; my previous one had moved away). He sent me for blood work and an EKG. Both came back negative. I only found out because I hadn't heard back for a week since the tests, so I phoned in.\n\nSometimes I notice this weird heartbeat more often, like a few times an hour or even a few times every 10 minutes. Other times, I don't notice it for long periods of time. And sometimes, usually when I'm engrossed in something else, I don't notice it at all.\n\nSo I'm just wondering what's going on. I'll be following up with this doctor, but do you folks have any advice or suggestions in the meantime as to what might be going on?",

IT'S THEIR JOB, so don't let them pass you off to another doctor.\n\nWhen I was having my first heart attack in 2009, my chest felt like it was being crushed by a bulldozer, but all my tests kept coming back negative so the doctor tried to tell me I had acid reflux. I kept telling him no to the point of standing toe to toe screaming at each other until he finally relented and sent me to get an angiogram. They were, of course, shocked to find a 95% blockage in my LAD, which is affectionately referred to as \"the widow maker\" in their world.\n\nHeart attacks are all about blocked coronary arteries. ECG's and EKG's don't detect blockages, they detect heart function anomalies that *might* indicate blockages, but just because they don't indicate any issues doesn't definitively mean there aren't any. Same with coronary sonograms. Chest x-rays can be helpful, but chemical and/or treadmill stress tests are better.\n\nA troponin test only indicates whether you have elevated levels of that heart enzyme in your blood stream from a heart attack that caused actual damage. However, angina hurts as bad as a heart attack -- and can eventually lead to having a big one -- but it doesn't often cause damage on its own so there wouldn't be any elevated troponin enzyme levels. A negative troponin test means there wasn't any damage -- yet -- it doesn't mean there aren't any serious blockages causing the pain.\n\nAfter 12 years and 8 stents, the only definitive test I know of is an angiogram. It hurts, its invasive and it's expensive, so maybe it might not be warranted if every other test comes back negative. But if antacids or the Purple Pill don't work for your acid reflux, it might be worth taking a look.\n\nYou mentioned you \"woke up\" with a burning sensation, and laying down can worsen acid reflux so maybe it is that.

I've been sick with a sinus infection and sore throat for about 2 weeks now. The other day I noticed when I would blow my nose, I could smell ammonia. When I looked it up, all signs pointed to kidney issues. I stopped drinking and have had no withdrawal. My overall feeling, health wise, is usually decent. Nothing noticeable. I finally broke down and went to the doctor to get some antibiotics for my sinus infection. My blood pressure initially showed 180/140. They waited a few minutes and checked again and it was 161/121. I am aware this is no good... How far have I potentially damaged my body? Can I turn this ship around by changing my exercise, eating, and drinking habits?

The advancements in medical science have immensely benefitted patients in many ways, minimally invasive cardiac surgery being one of them.\n\nMinimally invasive cardiac surgeries are performed using small incisions. But to understand the procedure, it is helpful to compare it with open-heart surgery. In open-heart surgery, the breastbone is cut, which means the incision is much larger. For a long time, open-heart surgery was the only option for patients with severe cardiac problems. However, the advent of **minimally invasive cardiac surgery** has changed that completely.\n\nRead More: [https://gktiyer.blogspot.com/2023/01/what-is-minimally-invasive-cardiac.html](https://gktiyer.blogspot.com/2023/01/what-is-minimally-invasive-cardiac.html)",

(9000 mg/dl ) normal reference number is (0-40 mgdl).\nImmediately angiography done and it revealed 95% RCA blockage. 2 stents have been placed via angioplasty and he is doing fine now. I guess it's genetic ( i have higher lipoprotein A, currently taking niacin/ b3 for it, there's no other treatments for it as of now here ).",

It skipped my father‘s generation, but his mother and her father had major issues with heart disease. My grandmother had a heart attack at 40. If you’re aware of this heredity factor you should most definitely see a cardiologist. \n\nI was diagnosed after having what I thought was a heart attack and having to visit the ER.   I was only 38 and I’m an average weight, seemingly healthy female. I’m just thankful that they took me seriously. As a younger woman you get dismissed a lot when it comes to your concerns. \n\nI was given a CT scan with contrast. They also gave me medication to slow my heart while they did the CT scan so they could see better. I was also given an echo. I have to say it is pretty neat to watch your own heartbeat during the echo. Thankfully it has been caught early and I was put on something for my cholesterol and my high blood pressure. Later I was sent to the cardiologist and I was given a stress test, which thankfully I passed. Catch it early and hopefully you can keep it in check. Putting it off only makes things worse.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a man, 29 years old. 170 cm, 55 kg. I have a chronic kidney disease (glomerulonephritis, stage 3). I control my blood pressure with Perindopril. Have never been overweight, but I’m not fit at all either.\n\nIn March 2021 I had a terrible headache, chest pain, higher blood pressure than usual and difficulty focusing my eyesight (I couldn’t read). This episode lasted for a couple days, and ever since it went away, I had these symptoms:\n\n* Constant chest tightness and chest discomfort, primarily on the left side. It feels like something is squeezing my chest.\n* Constant shortness of breath and inability to take a satisfying breath. Feeling that something in the chest doesn’t open up and air doesn’t reach where it is supposed to go. Breathing feels shallow. I cannot even breathe in enough air to talk and get out of breath all the time when speaking.\n* Very frequent, almost constant, chest pain. The pain is usually right under my left breast, where I can feel the heartbeat. It feels like intense squeezing or pressure. I wake up with this pain in the morning quite often and have it for days. I can’t seem to pinpoint what triggers it.\n* Palpitations, not very frequent\n* Strong heartbeat, feeling of pulsation in the body\n* Dizziness, brain fog, tiredness\n\nI experience chest tightness and difficulty breathing literally **all the time**, they never subside. I tried daily jogging during the summer and the autumn, and the pain doesn’t necessarily come during or right after training (although that can happen too). I don’t know if there is a direct connection between the pain and physical exertion.\n\nAt this point I have done these tests, some of them multiple times:\n\n* Blood and urine test: don’t show anything except for my kidney disease\n* Spirometry: shows reduction in lungs volume. Asthma medicines give no improvements.\n* Chest X-rays: everything is ok\n* Electrocardiography: everything is ok\n* Echocardiogram: everything is ok\n* Heart CT scan: showed a slight incipient atherosclerosis in left anterior descending artery, but my doctor says it shouldn’t give symptoms like these.\n* Gastroscopy: esophagus is fine.\n* Threadmill: according to the doctor, the test shows that everything is ok, but I get tired and out of breath during running very quickly. \n\nI have used three different asthma inhalers for half a year without any effect. I get heartburn quite often, and medicines against that help, but they don’t improve shortness of breath or chest pain at all. After CT scan detected slight atherosclerosis, I started taking Atorvastatin.\n\nI don’t hyperventilate. I breathe at a normal rate, but the feeling of air hunger is always there. Sometimes I intentionally take a deeper breath. It can be successful and air hunger subsides for a moment, or it feels like my chest doesn’t increase in volume after specific point and I don’t get a satisfying breath. Oximeter shows normal oxygen saturation of the blood (even during jogging).\n\nSome doctors I’ve encountered suggest that this is psychological issue, but I don’t think so because a) I’ve never experienced any panic attacks or similar before, b) it doesn’t explain the starting episode and c) it doesn’t feel connected to my psychological state.\n\nI am vaccinated against corona.\n\nAll in all, doctors claim my heart is ok, but I am not sure about it. Asthma inhalers don’t help. Majority of the symptoms are there 24/7, without changing much for better or worse during more than a year. I have been to ER a bunch of times, and my doctors have no idea what this could be.\n\nIs anyone here been in a similar situation? What can I do? This feels like this is a heart issue, but I don’t know. Shouldn’t CT rule it out? Can it happen that CT doesn’t pick up any conditions, bur MRI does it? Should I insist on getting MRI? Are there other tests I should do?",

        "body": "I had a lot of the same symptoms as you back in 2019.  I'm 53 and started experiencing heart symptoms when I was 49.  I had a nasty viral infection probably from March through July of 2019.  Not COVID-19, as this was 1 year before COVID-19 hit the U.S.  I went to the doctor several times and one time they did some sort of viral assay and said \"well, not the flu, but its viral\" type of answer.  It was a respiratory infection with horrible coughing, and just about everything else you can imagine that goes with a respiratory infection.\n\nIn July 2019 it cleared up.\n\nAnd then about mid-August 2019 I started getting symptoms of \"puffiness\" and my chest started, very slowly, getting a bit tighter and tighter.  No pain though.  After about 3-4 weeks of this, I went to a hospital and stayed overnight.  The viral illness that I had was causing some type of quickly progressing congestive heart failure and I was experiencing a high level of water retention in my body (leg was starting to poof up a bit).  A diuretic cleared that up right away.  I was released the next day although they couldn't figure out why my standing heart rate was about 120 bpm.\n\nThey did a cath procedure within a few days and they couldn't see or visualize anything that was blocked.  They did lots of other tests as well.  My ejection fraction from my left ventricle was low, like 20%, so they knew I had some type of congestive heart failure.\n\nThey put me on several meds that were switched around a few times over the next couple of months.  I don't want to say I'm \"cured\" but the meds saved my life - stabilized me, and improved my heart function somewhat.  I haven't need a pacemaker (there's a certain type of pacemaker that is usually recommended for people that have a low ejection fracture).  The meds I'm on now have mostly stayed the same since the beginning of 2020.\n\nRight now, my ejection fracture has stabilized at 35-40%.  Not the best, but I get tested about every 6-12 months and its been good for 3 years at this level.  I don't have tightness, or having a feeling of being winded.  I haven't gotten back to my usual exercise regimen, but I can go on fast walks and easy/moderate hikes and feel fine.",

    "selftext": "Let me preface this by explaining what I’ve been going through for the past ~2 months or so\n\nBack in early October I was visiting my boyfriend in Michigan and since it’s a state where weed is legal we decided to give some a try. I hadn’t done it since college so it had been a few years, and I’m assuming I just did too much too fast because it triggered a panic attack. Ambulance was called and they told me I just needed to go back inside and relax so that’s what I did. The panic attack eventually subsided and everything was all good. \n\nHowever, that panic attack absolutely scared the FUCK out of me and during it I legitimately thought I was going to die because I had never experienced anything like that before. Ever since then I’ve had extreme health anxiety relating to my heart and I’m overly aware of almost every beat, constantly freaking about whether or not I’m having a heart attack or some other episode. This has led me to get multiple EKGs, all of which turned up completely normal. This wasn’t enough to convince me however, so my PCP set up an appointment with a cardiologist to have an echo done. \n\nFast forward to this past Friday, I visit the cardiologist and they start me off by putting a 24 hour Holter on me before the echo. So I put the Holter on, wait a day, and come back for the echo. \n\nAfter the echo I am told my heart is structurally perfect (which is GREAT news for my anxious mind) however they tell me my heart rate spiked multiple times that night with the Holter on, all while I was asleep. The cardiologist suspects this is SVT and prescribed beta blockers which I started taking tonight. \n\nThe reason why I’m skeptical is because of it was SVT wouldn’t I also be having episodes while I’m awake? I have never had any episodes of a spiked heart rate since the panic attack so this comes as such a shock to me. Is it possible that I am just so stressed about my health that I am just having anxiety attacks in my sleep instead of it being SVT? Or is there a possibility of it being something else?",

    "selftext": "\n\nSo basically at one point in my life I was extremely obsessed with losing weight and just having a general addiction to the gym. One day I idiotically decided to take a fat burning supplement that contained a herb called ephedra which contains ephedrine. The first day I took it I immediately felt extreme cold sweats and a fast paced heart rate yet it seemed to wear off around 10 mins later so I shrugged it off and seemed it to be anxiety related as I was already anxious to take the pill. The next time I took it was a couple of days later at half the dosage and everything seemed fine at first until towards the end of my workout when everything went wrong. While walking on the treadmill I felt the sensation of my heart dropping to my stomach and immediately got very cold and a very fast heart rate. I tried to calm myself down as my friend has been taking the full dosage for around a week now with no symptoms. My symptoms seemed to not go away as panic set in for me and I began to realize I needed medical attention. I was rushed to the nearest hospital and described what I took. They did a ECG and a blood test for Troponin however both seemed normal and I was sent back home. I was extremely nauseous and on edge yet nothing too serious. The next day towards the night I got the same similar heart drop feeling and was rushed again just to have all tests seem normal again. The doctor stated that I was an adverse reaction to the herb and my body was trying to get rid of it by sweating it out. The next couple\nOf days I felt horrible and couldn’t get myself to eat I was shaky and nauseous. I booked an appointment with a cardiologist and did every test possible. The echo came back seemingly normal yet with an extremely low amount of LVH (left ventricle hypertrophy) deemed within the normal range by other doctors. I still felt palpations and a weird heart rate so we did a holster test a couple days later just for it to also come back normal. The doctor claimed I was healthy and fine and just to relax and take the medications he asked me to. I was given concor (beta blocker) with a 1.25mg daily dose (very small) and anti depressants just for my anxiety. Things seemed to get better however I was still scarred to death reading about all the adverse affect people my age would experience such as sudden death and permanent disabilities. I would also experience small chest pinches and chest pain for a couple of seconds that didn’t get worse with breathing or laying down. Weeks later everything seemed to be going back to normal however caffine and nicotine would\nMake me a bit anxious yet I seemed fine this lasted a month or two. Towards that time I began my first year of uni and traveled overseas. During my time there everything was fine and I was extremely happy with going back to my normal life yet a couples of weeks later I got this huge sense of dizziness that seemed life threading sort of. This dizziness would only be resolved by making myself full or eating consistently yet I still experienced a crazy amount of brain fog. I scared myself with some more research and found that the anti-depressant I was taking (escitalopram, cipralix) has a small chance of causing arrhythmias and QT wave prolongnations in the heart. I spoke to my doctor about this and he said that I could stop taking it if I wanted to and everything seemed fine so I tried stopping. After doing so I would take it every two days or so to slowly stop the dose but once I took it I would get the same heart dropping cold sweat feeling I got beforehand and I could never take it again since then. I got severe depression for a while just randomly crying for no reason but the faded away. Doctor also noted that since all tests were negative there was no reason for me to take concor anymore except if I felt anxious. after stopping all of my meds, I started getting this chest pain and extreme anxiety again and with my parents across the sea I started to panic. I eneded up losing a term of university and going back home to run some medical tests and be near my parents for the time. I was at the worst state of my life always crying and feel chest pain accompanied by regular symtomps of heart attacks such as back in pain and pain in arms however they would come and go as they please and sometimes separate from each other. I begged for another echocardiogram and had another one done which I sent to several cardiologist and they all deemed my symomtps to be anxiety related and they stated that’s several teenagers are reporting similar chest pains after the vaccine with no explanation. The last thing we could have possibly checked was my arteries and I did a CT coronary scan with a contrast dye. Everything once again seemed normal and there were no signs of any inflammation. Yet the chest pain and occasional Dizziness still remained and I was sick of hearing that it was anxiety based. I also had somewhat above high average creatinine levels (accompanied by kidney pain) however after drinking a good amount of water my levels went down from 1.19 to 0.97. Now I have no idea what to do. I always fear the chance that doctors may have misdiagnosed me and I have a huge constant fear for my health. I know I am very young for this to happen but the fact that I took the supplements is causing me to think that this has something to do with it. A doctor told me that since I took the pill months ago and done all the related tests it would be too late for something new to occur since then. I realized that a lot of this happend after I stopped my anti-depressant but now I am horrified of taking any SSRI’s because of their potential heart risks and I still fear something very wrong is happening. I have been prescribed a new different type of beta blocker called propanol for anxiety and rescued heart rate but it’s giving me this sense of my heart burning and after I take it I find it hard to breathe for a couple minutes before it goes away. What do you guys think? I have not been able to live normally in forever and always panic and overthink that I may suddenly die the next day. \n\nFor general information I am 18 years old and used to be very athletic. I took the pill in august and it’s now december. I she  ran these tests throughout the months since.",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit\n\nWouldn't normally go to a forum for medical advice but I'm a bit stumped as to what is wrong with me and what best course of action is.\n\nI'm 36 and, to my knowledge, fit and healthy however have a history of recreational drug use, particularly relevant being ketamine and cocaine. I don't smoke and I'm not an especially heavy drinker.\n\n2 months or so ago I noticed I was getting irregular heart beats when doing intense exercise and when partying. They went away quickly and I didn't dwell on it. However I had one 'episode' where it lasted a whole evening which was quite scary. My heart wasn't going especially fast, just skipping beats and it felt very floppy or loose, and generally seemed weak. I should have gone to hospital in hindsight but went to bed and it went back to normal next day, however I had a tight strained feeling in my chest for days afterwards. This feeling seems to improve when I exercise (although being careful not to push myself too hard).\n\nIt went away and I felt normal then I got irregular beats again doing weights. This time they went away quite fast but the strained feeling came back that day and stayed with me 10 days or so, improving each day. It's a 3 out of 10 in terms of pain/discomfort but definitely noticeable. Top left side of chest. \n\nI've been to doctor and also cardiologist. ECG came back fine but of course if they don't catch the arrhythmia in action then it's tricky. I had blood tests and they listened to my heart and they said all seems fine. However something is clearly wrong here.\n\nIt feels like controlled cardio is good for it and the threshold for which it flips in to arrhythmia can be built up if I keep exercising. But if I push it too hard it comes back and then it seems to come back more easily.\n\nI'm worried that these irregular beats and weakening of damaging my heart. Neither doctor was able to explain the strained feeling and almost insinuating it's in my head. What I'm feeling is not in my head, it's way to pronounced and there's definitely a correlation between it and the irregular beats.\n\nI've bought a fitbit charge 5 and hoping to catch the irregular beats next time they happen. But I also don't want to make them happen as I suffer for days afterwards. I believe the doctor is going to get me one I can wear for 24 hours but same issue, need the irregular bears to occur in that time frame.\n\nMy current plan is to keep exercising and go with my intuition and build up resilience and try and make it go away if that's even possible. \n\nI'd love to know if anyone has had a similar experience.\n\nFor the record I've not taken any drugs since it became apparent this is potentially serious and I'm drinking very little alcohol, a couple of small drinks a week, if that.",

    "selftext": "I'm a female 30 years old. I pretty suddenly about 5 years ago started getting these extremely fast heart racing episodes (thought it was panic attacks induced from smoking pot, because it started happening everytime I smoked, even though I was a long time 10+ years  pot smoker at that point and never had SVT episodes before) and around the same time I actually suffered a concussion. This concussion was also misdiagnosed at first as panic attacks/ anxiety, even psychosis (I thought I was going crazy, feelings I had was never like anything I've felt before and they really sucked, I even quit my job at the time because I just couldn't even see straight) until I convinced a Dr to give me an MRI and CT scan of my brain, which resulted in evidence my brain was healing from a concussion, a week and a half after the fact. During the concussion my svt episodes became worse (still thought it was anxiety/panic attacks so didn't call 911) but I was able to get them to stop after learning how to on my own (bearing down/trying to take deep breaths and holding them slightly) until it became harder and harder to rid them. After 2 1/2 weeks, I woke up one day finally feeling normal out of nowhere. It was like a miracle. Except svt episodes still occured. Still thinking it was just panic attacks, I thought really nothing of it.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got an episode I couldn't stop. This scared me so much, I was in svt for about 30 mins and called EMT, telling them I couldn't get my \"heart palpitations\" to stop. I originally thought they were heart palpitations caused by anxiety (cause that's what they always told me) until the EKG of 230 bpm proved otherwise and paramedics said I'll probably have to be on heart meds or have ablation. This is where I learned svt was even a thing. They had to shoot me with adenasine 3 times to get it to stop (6mg, 12mg and 12mg) and that was so dreadfully scary, but also relieved when it stopped... Weirdest feeling ever. They asked if I had a history of anxiety, which I do, and said this is why it was misdiagnosed for years. \n\nI realize now I've had countless episodes. It used to be a few times a week, sometimes I'd go a week or 2 without episodes, but never a full month I don't think. I guesstimate about 50+ svt attacks in the last 5 years. It got to the point where I can't do any cardio excersize without an episode. Chest pains that I thought was anxiety, was probably angina this whole time, and it's happened a lot. \n\nI'm seeing a cardiologist for my first time on the 13th (soonest appt I can get thanks Kaiser) and my primary put me on propranolol 10mg twice a day and still get flutters almost everyday. Thinking about taking it three times a day now. I was 3 weeks without an episode until the other night, caused by me simply riding my shopping cart to my car like a skateboard (I know silly something I've always done tho) and it's crazy that just that short and very little of excersize was enough to set it off. I didn't have my medication on me, and home was 30 mins away, and even tho I wasn't really in full svt, perhaps from the propranolol (maybe 150 bpm as opposed to 230 bpm that was recorded on EKG before) I was still about to have a bout and my anxiety was thru the roof. I took my propranolol as soon as I got thru the door and called 911, and thankfully it subsided as the paramedics got to me. They did an EKG to make sure (I was at 98bpm but irregular beat) and 10 minutes later I was back to regular heartbeat and 80 bpm, blood pressure was a bit high though (140/something)\n\nI quit cigs (smoked since I was 17), pot (smoked since I was 15) and even coffee, I used to drink about 2 cups everyday for years. I pretty much quit all cold turkey just from being scared of SVT. My grandma died at 68 of a heart attack (probably from smoking cigs, which did a toll her to after she beat breast cancer not long before I'm sure) and my dad died 2 1/2 years ago from a heart attack as well, but he didn't smoke cigs for more than 10 years of his life (quit when he was 30), he was 59 when he died. He was a chronic pot smoker his whole life however and hbp but refused to take meds (as a pharmacy tech now, I'm mad at myself for not making him take his meds, as they might have saved his life).\n\nI don't know if I'm just ranting at this point, or really want to try and find someone I can relate with on this matter and if my heart might heal. Will I ever dance again? I love dancing but I'm so afraid of SVT now. Will ablation be my only option? I actually really want it, the propranolol gives me horrible vivid dreams every single night, but will doctor just keep trying different meds until I don't get episodes anymore? The thing is, I don't wan to \"wait and see\", I want ablation more than meds but afraid doctor will just try everything before ablation is on the table. Is having 50+ svt episodes enough to consider me for ablation? I know most say svt is benign but I'm afraid it's not in me... My heart feels weaker than ever and I'm only 30. Has anyone had this many episodes and are fine now? I really need to know...\n\nEdit March 10 2023 (original post was I believe mid-end November 2022: since I've had a few people ask I should let everyone know I actually ended up getting heart ablation on February 7th 2023. It was a very weird and nerve-wracking operation since you're awake, but they sedated me enough to feel less nervous. You do feel burning in your chest when they do the ablation (in my case multiple times to get the whole spot) but it was bearable. They had to go in both my groin vessels in my case, I guess mine was a hard to reach spot or \"tricky\" as the doctor put it. I was on metoprolol for about 2 months (switched from propranolol after I saw my cardiologist after I posted this), from when I was officially diagnosed to my ablation, and although it did help I did have 2 episodes in those months but I was able to get them to stop after taking an extra dose of metoprolol, although it took about 15-20 minutes for it to kick in and stop it. I got my echocardiogram and ablation appointment set the same day I saw my cardiologist, they basically recommended it right away because of how many episodes I have had. Even though Kaiser is usually a slow process I'm very happy I went from diagnosed to ablation in just about 3 months with only 2 episodes in between. It's now been a little over a month since the ablation and I'm happy to say I'm SVT free, besides the few 1 second flutters but that's apparently totally normal as the heart tissue heals, and those are happening less often now. I stopped taking the metoprolol after the ablation, per doctors orders, probably to see if the ablation actually worked. It's so nice to not have an episode for a month and I'm rly grateful I did it. It did cost me about 6k in the end from my deductible but the whole operation alone is about 30k, at least with Kaiser, but for me is totally worth it as I'm just so relieved now. Fingers crossed cause they do say the heart tissue healing takes about 3 months, so I'm still in what they call a \"blanking\" period to see if it was successful or not. But I'm already getting the feeling it worked, like they say it does about 90-95% of the time. Hope this helps someone who is also looking into ablation, especially if you had like 2-5 episodes a month like I did, I would recommend it.\n\nEdit May 2023: still SVT free and I feel great. Gotta say my anxiety has since gotten better also, before I would never have gone 3 months without an episode since 2018 when it first started happening, even tho I thought they were panic attacks back then. I feel like I'm free again to do whatever I want and go wherever without the fear of having an episode and being pumped with adenosine again. I still get the once in a while flutter but it only happens for a beat, and then it's like the ablation completely keeps the SVT from happening. I strongly recommend ablation if SVT controls your life and medication isn't working as good as it used to.",

The machine at the doctor's office could not read higher than 250, so I don't know how high it actually was. I was put on a cocktail of medication that I take 4 times a day.\n\nI feel like a shell of myself now. My medication causes confusion, memory loss, my reflexes are slower making it harder to drive. I have dark skin under my eyes, regardless of how much I sleep. I get cold in my extremities, sometimes it hurts. And most recently, the past week I have had non-stop indigestion in my upper stomach/esophagus area. Indigestion is a symptom of heart attack in some women, so it has me worried.\n\nI have similar feelings as you and in my mind I assume I will die in my 50's of heart failure, like so many of my family members before me. I'm doing my best to try to live what decent life I can for myself. It may seem morbid to some but it's what helps me cope with my eventual death. I have no idea what major thing I want to do with my life before I die, but I just don't want to suffer while I live.",

Its actually 4:00 am now as my body won't let me sleep. Little embarrassing but Its been 3 days since I used a laser comb for a few minutes to treat my hairloss. My heart always responds this way if I try the laser comb or minoxidil, even in super low dose. I had an echo done a few years ago and I had mild valve leakage, mild wall thickening in right ventricle, mild enlarged right ventricle and a couple other mild type things. I don't smoke and am slender. I get fatigued very easily when my heart acts up like this and I can't sleep. Doctor wants me to get another echo and I'm sure the symptoms will fade by the time the appointment arises. Should I use the laser comb the day before testing to show what occurs when I use it? I dont think its a normal response that my heart gives to these things. Or should I abstain from it and run the risk of my cardiologist saying to do nothing as I have a bunch of mild things going on? Thanks any feedbackbos most appreciated!",

I too have had stomach issues. Usually acid reflux and heart palpations. But i noticed my acid reflux completely went away when i controlled my anxiety. I still get pains on my left side of my chest sometimes that come on for a few seconds then go away which makes me check my blood pressure and i usually find it around 140/80, as I calm down my blood pressure drops. I say all of this to tell you to trust the doctors. im not sure what tests they have done but if they checked you out then you need to trust them and relax. If you go for a run and notice chest pains or shortness of breath then i would be concerned but if your only getting these issues at rest and not when working out i dont see how it could be heart related. I take zoloft and find it calms my mind but i still struggle with health anxiety. heart palpations also scare me but every test they have done on me has came back clean also. its a daily battle but know your not alone and just take a deep breath and try and relax. heart issues do not come and go a bad heart would give you issues when you are working out and you would have symptoms all the time. sweaty palms, palpations, stomach issues can all be caused by anxiety. give the medication time to kick in and see how you feel in a few months. im not a doctor tho so please dont take my advice as such but if the doctors are telling you you are fine then you probably are. if you are really worried about it see if they will do a calcium score test and that can see if you have blockage in your heart or not. i wish the best for you and kow your not alone.",

In fact, some health conditions may be passed down from one generation to the next. It's important to be aware of this so that you can take steps to protect your overall well-being. \n\nWhen diagnosing an illness, one of the first things that doctors will do is study the family health history in order to get a better understanding of the condition and what may have caused it. The heart is not only the center of emotions but also an indicator of the kind of health that has been passed down from your ancestors. There are many reasons for heart disease, including chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels, as well as intense stress levels.

Are you happening to eat a big or fatty meal and then laying down? That can definitely cause GERD, and people go to the ER all the time suspecting a heart attack, when it's just heartburn.\n\nAn EKG isn't going to reveal heart disease, and the blood test you took was likely to test if you had a heart attack, by looking at your troponin levels.\n\nHowever, what they do reveal (in relation to heart disease) is your risk level. They would've told you if you were at high risk for heart disease. Your troponin levels would have been elevated enough to show that, and the EKG would reveal heart arrhythmia. Trust the doctors in that you're likely just fine, at least for right now. \n\nHowever:\n\nI have very early stage heart disease, and I'm 44, in probably the best shape of my life. My primary care doc said I was fine. I kept pushing and they did more tests and ordered an ultrasound done to check blood flow. Everything came back completely normal. My dad introduced me to his cardiologist and they did a stress test on me, which revealed something. So they did a CT scan with that contrast dye stuff and confirmed what was suspected. \n\nWhat's comforting to me is knowing that mine is completely genetic. My cardiologist said there's nothing I did (or can do) to cause this. I'm fit, I go mountain biking, my blood pressure and heart rate are really good, and I'm at the gym usually 5x/week. I eat a healthyish diet; I don't do fried or greasy/fatty foods at all, but I do have a sweet tooth.",

The only information i have ever, at all learned and honestly shocked to learn about my condition and heart desease was through my on reading and discovered through Google. A follow up appointment approximately three weeks after my cath. lasted about 4 minutes, he asked did i have anymore angina attacks ( i had a few) and simply said take my neds and he would see me again in six months. No guidance, no explanation of my condition, nothing. I had already read up on the basics and didnt ask any relevant questions as going in thought it would be explained in full. I think ive been to worried and scared to. My knowledge of heart desease was basically zero although its in my family, but for whatever uneducated, unknown reason i never thought it would happen to me. Its a shock, its scary, and life changing. I still get angina attacks, about 4 a week and the only way i know how to describe them is that it starts with pain in the back if my left upper arm, sometimes in my jaw and mouth and chest. A raw, hard , fatigue like sickness overwhelms me that last anywhere 2-3 minutes it seems and then i feel a relieved rush type feeling as i guess the blood releases, and its over. Its a very sick, scary, debilitating feeling and one thats dreaded when they occur. I am  improving  my diet, my exercises are limited as ive recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my knees, my  right knee is unbearable at times, however thru a vitamin supplement that helps with inflammation and Tylenol im able to limp around for short periods of times. The left is not near as bad but know it's only a matter of time. Staying active and being able to exercise properly is a must i know, but this limits me tremendously. I do walk through the pain as best i can, but dont think its enough. A knee replacement im sure is coming. I am considering seeing a nutritionist as both deseases require a proper diet. Apologies for skipping around, just needed to post this and curious how others with angina and learning of there heart desease, how are you coping, what are your thoughts, feelings, advice?. If i sound like im feeling sorry for myself, im not, im a little out of sorts and scared a little, but its not a pity party, only a big surprise for lack of a better word. I am also surprised this sub doesn't get the numbers, with heart desease so common, who knows i guess. Thanks for reading, hope its helps someone and hope to hear your story. Take care!",

I've accidentally skipped a blood thinner once and I've been ok, but it really depends on the specific blood thinner and why you're taking it.\n\nOne way or another she needs to get on top of this as soon as possible. And if it's a blood pressure medication she really shouldn't wait, like at all. Have her call her doctor now and explain the situation. They should be able to call in the script to her pharmacy and then she can pick it up. It's not a good idea to mess around with this stuff. Best of luck!",
