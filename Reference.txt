Folks,

Thank you for the outstanding presentations showcasing innovative top-down designs for your projects. I’d like to share a a few sample analysis methods on Key Recurring Themes (KRTs)  (refer to Paper1
, Appendix1 given in this folder) and their Boolean patterns (Paper2).

I encourage the TrustMed teams to focus their efforts on one or two priority disease areas, such as Type II Diabetes and Heart Disease/Hypertension.

As a first step, please collect 500–1,000 discussion threads from relevant online health forums and patient communities. These discussions should center on the selected disease areas. Conduct a detailed qualitative analysis of these threads to identify Key Recurring Themes (KRTs) that appear both in the original posts/questions and in their responses/answers.

The primary objective is to uncover the top few recurring themes related to:

    Symptoms and early warning signs

    Medications, including dosage experiences and side effects

    Treatments and management strategies, including lifestyle adjustments

These insights will directly support the design of a medical information interpretation system capable of:

    Understanding and interpreting meta-information embedded in user-generated health queries and community responses.

    Developing intelligent lookup strategies to retrieve, integrate, and summarize relevant insights from trusted medical knowledge sources.

By grounding the system in real-world patient and caregiver discussions, these findings will:

    Enhance answer-generation strategies to ensure alignment with users’ core health concerns, symptom–treatment relationships, and problem–solution contexts.

    Enable incorporation of auxiliary recommendations and safety insights, such as potential drug–drug and drug–diet interactions.

Ultimately, this work will help TrustMed deliver accurate, contextually aware, and patient-centered responses that address users’ true informational and decision-making needs.

All Best, 
Hasan
