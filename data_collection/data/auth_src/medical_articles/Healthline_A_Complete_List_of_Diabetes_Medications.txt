Medications for type 1 diabetes primarily focus on replacing insulin, as the body cannot produce it on its own. They include short-acting, rapid-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, and combination insulins, as well as amylinomimetic injectables.

Type 2 diabetes medications aim to help the body use insulin more effectively or eliminate excess glucose from the blood, and include both oral drugs and injectable drugs.

People with diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2, may need additional medications to address related health conditions like high cholesterol and high blood pressure.

In May 2020, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA)recommended that some makers of extended-release metformin remove some of their tablets from the U.S. market. This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets. If you currently take this drug, call a healthcare professional. They will advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription.

Diabetesis a condition that leads to high levels of bloodglucose(sugar) in the body.

This reaction happens when your body can’t make or use the hormone insulin like it’s supposed to. Produced by the pancreas, insulin helps your body use the sugar from the food you eat.

There are two major types of diabetes:type 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes. People with either type need medications to help manage their blood sugar levels.

The types of medications you take depend on the type of diabetes you have. Learn more about the available treatment options.

Medications for type 1 diabetes

If you have type 1 diabetes, your body can’t make its owninsulin. The goal of treatment is to replace the insulin that your pancreas can’t make.

Insulin is the most common type of medication used in type 1 diabetes treatment. There are more thanfive classes of insulinsold in the United States under many names, both brand and generic.

Insulin is given as an infusion under the skin (with the help of aninsulin pump) or as aninjection.

There are multiple types of insulin. They vary based on how quickly they start working, how long they work, and whether they have a peak level of action.

The type of insulin you need depends on your body’s sensitivity to insulin and the severity of your insulin deficiency. These include the following:

Regular or “short-acting” insulin may reach the bloodstream 30 minutes after injection and peak 2–3 hours afterward. These injections also workup to 3–6 hours.

Types of regular insulin include:

Novolin R FlexPen ReliOn

As the name suggests, rapid-acting insulin works within15 minutes. The peak time is 1–2 hours after use, and the medication lasts between 2 and 4 hours.

The available types of rapid-acting insulin include:

inhaled insulin (Afrezza)

insulin aspart, sold under brand names including:FiaspFiasp FlexTouchFiasp PenFillNovoLogNovoLog FlexPenNovoLog FlexTouchNovoLog PenFillReliOn NovoLogReliOn NovoLog FlexPen

Humalog Junior KwikPen

insulin lispro-aabc (Lyumjev, Lyumjev KwikPen)

Intermediate-acting insulin

Intermediate-acting insulin works about2–4 hoursafter use, with an average peak time of 4–12 hours. You can expect this type of insulin to last between 12 and 18 hours.

insulin isophane, sold under brand names including:Humulin N U-100Humulin N KwikPenNovolin NNovolin N FlexPenNovolin N ReliOnNovolin N FlexPen ReliOn

Novolin N FlexPen ReliOn

Long lasting insulin helps lower your blood glucose levels for up to24 hoursor longer. It stabilizes your bloodstream longer without a peak.

The types of available long-acting insulin include:

insulin glargine, sold under brand names including:BasaglarKwikPenLantusLantus SoloStarToujeo SoloStarToujeo Max SoloStar

insulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee-yfgn)

concentrated regular insulin (Humulin R U-500, Humulin R U-500 KwikPen)

Combination (premixed) insulins

Combination insulins typically contain a rapid or immediate acting insulin with a regular or short acting insulin to provide coverage both immediately and shortly after.

insulin aspart protamine/insulin aspart 70/30 (NovoLog Mix 70/30, NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen)

insulin lispro protamine/insulin lispro 75/25 (Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog Mix 75/25 KwikPen)

Amylinomimetic injectables

Pramlintide (SymlinPen) is an amylinomimetic. It’s an injectable medication that’s used before meals.

It works by delaying the time your stomach takes to empty itself. It also reduces the secretion of the hormone glucagon after meals. These actions lower your blood sugar.

Pramlintide reduces appetite, too.

Medications for type 2 diabetes

If you havetype 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin butno longer uses it well. Your body can’t make enough insulin to keep yourblood sugar levelswithin an optimal range.

The goal of type 2 diabetes treatment is to help your body use insulin better or to get rid of extra glucose in your blood.

Most medicationsfor type 2 diabetes are oral drugs. However, insulin or injectables may also be used. Some of these medications are combinations of more than one diabetes drug.

Some people with type 2 diabetes may also need to take insulin. The same types of insulin used to treat type 1 diabetescan also treattype 2 diabetes.

A doctor may recommend the aforementioned types of insulin used in type 1 diabetes treatment for type 2 diabetes. As with type 1 diabetes, this depends on the type of insulin needed and the severity of your insulin deficiency. See the above types of insulin to discuss with a doctor.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors

These medications help your body break down starchy foods and table sugar. This effect lowers your blood sugar levels.

These medications may causehypoglycemia(low blood sugar). Your risk of hypoglycemiamay be greaterif you take them with other types of diabetes medications. Therefore, it’s important to take them only as prescribed.

For best results, take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors before meals. These medications include:

Biguanides decrease how much glucose your liver makes. They also decrease how much glucose your intestines absorb, help your muscles absorb glucose, and make your body more sensitive to insulin.

The most common biguanide ismetformin(Glumetza).

Metformin is considered themost commonlyprescribed oral medication for type 2 diabetes. It can also be combined with other type 2 diabetes medications. It’s an ingredient in the following medications:

metformin-alogliptin (Kazano)

metformin/canagliflozin (Invokamet)

metformin/dapagliflozin (Xigduo XR)

metformin/empagliflozin (Synjardy)

metformin/ertugliflozin (Segluromet)

metformin/glyburide (Glucovance)

metformin/linagliptin (Jentadueto, Jentadueto XR)

metformin/pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Actoplus Met XR)

metformin/repaglinide

metformin/saxagliptin

metformin/sitagliptin (Janumet, Janumet XR)

Bromocriptine(Cycloset) is a dopamine-2 agonist.

It’s unknown exactly how this drug treats type 2 diabetes. It may affect rhythms in your body and preventinsulin resistance.

According to one2016 review, dopamine-2 agonists may also improve other related health concerns, such ashigh cholesterolorweight management.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors

DPP-4 inhibitors are used to help reduce blood sugar without causing hypoglycemia.

DPP-4 inhibitorsblockthe DPP-4 enzyme. This enzyme destroys a hormone called incretin, which normally helps your body produce insulin when it’s needed. Incretins also decrease glucose output from the liver when your body doesn’t need it.

These drugs can also help thepancreasmake more insulin.

Examples of DPP-4 inhibitors include:

alogliptin/metformin (Kazano)

linagliptin (Tradjenta)

linagliptin/empagliflozin (Glyxambi)

linagliptin/metformin (Jentadueto, Jentadueto XR)

saxagliptin (Onglyza)

saxagliptin/metformin

sitagliptin (Januvia)

sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet and Janumet XR)

sitagliptin/simvastatin

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 receptor agonists)

GLP-1 receptor agonists are similar to incretin. A doctor may prescribe them in addition to a diet and exercise planto help promotebetter glycemic control.

GLP-1 receptor agonists increase how much insulin your body uses and the growth of pancreatic beta cells. They decrease your appetite and how much glucagon your body uses.

GLP-1 receptor agonists also slow stomach emptying, which may maximize nutrient absorption from the foods you eat whilepotentially helpingyou maintain or lose weight.

These are all important actions for people with diabetes.

For some people, atheroscleroticcardiovascular disease,heart failure, orchronic kidney diseasemay predominate over their diabetes. In these cases, theAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA)recommends certain GLP-1 receptor agonists as part of a glucose-lowering treatment regimen.

dulaglutide (Trulicity)

exenatide extended-release (BydureonBCise)

liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza)

semaglutide (Ozempic)

tirzepatide (Mounjaro)

These medications help your body release insulin. However, they’re not for everyone. In some cases, they may lower your blood sugar too much,especiallyif you have advancedkidney disease.

nateglinide (Starlix)

repaglinide (Prandin)

Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from holding on to glucose. Instead, your body gets rid of the glucose through your urine.

Again, in cases where atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease predominate, the ADA recommends SGLT2 inhibitors as a possible treatment option. Examplesinclude:

canagliflozin (Invokana)

canagliflozin/metformin (Invokamet, Invokamet XR)

dapagliflozin (Farxiga)

dapagliflozin/metformin (Xigduo XR)

dapagliflozin/saxagliptin (Qtern)

empagliflozin (Jardiance)

empagliflozin/linagliptin (Glyxambi)

empaglifozin/linagliptin-metformin (Trijardy XR)

empagliflozin/metformin (Synjardy, Synjardy XR)

ertugliflozin (Steglatro)

These areamong the oldestdiabetes drugs still used today. They work by stimulating the pancreas with the help of beta cells. This causes your body to make more insulin.

glimepiride/pioglitazone (Duetact)

glipizide ER (Glipizide XL, Glucotrol XL)

Thiazolidinediones work by decreasing glucose in your liver. They also help your fat cells use insulin betterby targetinginsulin resistance.

These drugs come with an increased risk ofheart disease. If your doctor prescribes one of these drugs, they will monitor your heart function during treatment.

pioglitazone/alogliptin (Oseni)

pioglitazone/glimepiride (Duetact)

pioglitazone/metformin (Actoplus Met, Actoplus Met XR)

People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes often need to take other medications to treat conditions that are common with diabetes.

These drugs caninclude:

aspirin for heart health

medications forhigh cholesterol

high blood pressure medications

Many medications are available to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. They each work in different ways to help control your blood sugar.

Ask a doctor which diabetes drug may be the best fit for you. They can make recommendations based on the type of diabetes you have, your health, and other factors.

It’s also important to know that new medications for diabetes are constantly being investigated for approval.
