Some people claim that certain essential oils, such as peppermint, lavender, and ginger, may relieve a sore throat.

Essential oils are made from the leaves, flowers, or roots of specific plants. Through a process known as distillation, essential oils are extracted as a highly concentrated form of the plant. They contain many of the plants’ original medicinal properties.

There are various reported health benefits of essential oil use, including remedying a sore throat. However, the research around its use often relies on anecdotal claims and is light on empirical evidence.

In this article, we assess the efficacy of different essential oils for treating a sore throat.

How to use essential oils

Essential oils can be used aromatically by diffusing them into the air or diluted in a carrier oil and applied topically, but they should never be ingested.

Essential oils may be used aromatically, which means a person inhales them. This can be done in several different ways, including:

Using a room diffuser to spread the essential oil into the surrounding air.

Putting up to 7 drops of essential oil per 2 cups of boiling water into a bowl, placing a towel over the head and inhaling the steam.

Adding up to 3 drops of essential oil to a cotton ball or cloth and inhaling the fumes.

Adding essential oils to household surface cleaners or a load of laundry.

People should be very cautious about using essential oils around children and pets. Many essential oils are toxic or deadly for pets, especially cats.

Types of essential oils

There is no broad scientific support for the use of aromatherapy for treating respiratory conditions.

Arecent 2023 studyfound that it may be beneficial in reducing some COVID-19 symptoms. Some essential oils,such as tea tree oilmay also havelimited antimicrobial effects–meaning there is a possibility they may aid in recovery from throat infections. Essential oils that some people may find benefit from include:

However, it is important to be cautious about conclusive health claims relating to essential oils. While the above may help some people in sore throat management, a person should always speak with a healthcare professional before commencing use. Alternative therapies should also never take the place of doctor-recommended treatments.

It is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not monitor or regulate the quality of essential oils. This means that it is not always possible to know exactly what ingredients the manufacturers have used. For this reason, people should be sure to buy oils from a reputable source.

People should always do a test patch before using oils on their body, as they may have an allergic reaction. To do a test patch, put a dime-size spot of the diluted oil on the inner arm. If there is no reaction after 24 hours, the oil is safe to use.

Essential oils are highly concentrated and should only be used in small quantities. Even in small doses, they are not entirely safe andcan cause adverse side effects, including:

skin irritation (when applied topically)

If anyone experiences any adverse side effects, they should stop using essential oils and speak to a doctor. Anyone taking medications should also talk with a doctor to check whether the essential oils will react with the medicines.

It is unclear whether many essential oils are safe for pregnant women or children.

Some people may promote essential oils as an alternative to over-the-counter medications for sore throats. However, more high-quality evidence is needed to support the use and effectiveness of essential oils.

Essential oils are often mistaken for a risk-free form of therapy. However, they are highly concentrated substances that can have adverse side effects.
