================================================================================

Aspartame is an artificial sweetener and a popular sugar substitute sold under the brand names Nutrasweet and Equal. It is present in low-calorie food and drinks and some medications.

Despite its extensive use and popularity, aspartame has become a source of controversy in recent years, with some research suggesting the sweetener has adverse health effects.

It is not clear if aspartame helps people lose weight, as it may also increase appetite and affect a person’s metabolism. Aspartame may also be unsafe for certain people.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved aspartame for use as a sweetener in1974. The FDA has reviewedover 100studies about the safety of aspartame.

Agencies in Europe, Canada, and many other countries also approve its use, including:

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

Although there have been some concerns that aspartame may have the potential to cause cancer, risk assessments have foundlimited evidencefor this in humans.

Following these assessments, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) reaffirmed an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 milligrams (mg) of aspartame per kilogram (kg) of body weight.

Most people will not exceed this amount. If a person weighs 68 kg, they would need to drink around19 cansof soda or consume over 85 packs of aspartame every day to exceed the ADI.

People who eat and drink products containing aspartame consume around 4.9 mg/kg daily on average, which is around 10% of JECFA’s recommended ADI.

Side effects of aspartame

Aspartame may have the following side effects:

Effects on body weight

Aspartame contains4 calories per gram (g), which is a similar amount tosugar. However, it is around 200 times sweeter than sugar, so only a tiny amount of aspartame is necessary to sweeten foods and drinks. This is why people often use it inweight loss diets.

However, a2021 animal studyfound that aspartame ingestion in rats led to increases in body weight and fat mass due to increases in energy efficiency. Researchers associated this effect with the amount of aspartame rather than the form of ingestion.

Similarly, a2023 questionnaire studyfound an association between aspartame intake and greater body weight, waist circumference,body mass index (BMI), and increases in all three over 25 years.

However, a2018 trialfound that aspartame did not affect body weight in lean adults over 12 weeks.

Some researchsuggests that aspartame may increaseappetite.

However, other research does not support these findings. For example, a2018 studylooked at aspartame intake in 100 lean adults with a BMI of between 18 and 25 who were between the ages of 18 and 60 years.

Researchers found that aspartame intake over 12 weeks had no effects on appetite, body weight, orblood sugarmanagement.

Further research is necessary for a better understanding of the link between aspartame and appetite.

Effects on metabolism

A2024 animal studysuggests that long-term consumption non-nutritious sweeteners, including aspartame, does not cause adverse metabolic effects.

In contrast, a2021 reviewsuggests there may be a link between aspartame and metabolic conditions such astype 2 diabetes. However, more research is necessary to understand this potential connection.

The authors also suggest that the metabolic products of aspartame may be more harmful than aspartame itself.

A2021 animal studyassociated aspartame with glucose intolerance, concluding that aspartame may have adverse effects on metabolism.

Ultimately, more research in humans is necessary for experts to understand aspartame’s potential long-term metabolic effects.

Health risks of aspartame

TheFDAstates that aspartame is safe for the general population when manufacturers follow good practices and approved conditions of use.

However, some research suggests potential health risks.

A2019 studylooked at the short-term effects of aspartame on the blood and biochemical measurements in female Swiss albino mice over 30 days.

The study found that consuming aspartame was harmful to the mice and produced adverse effects relating to the blood and biochemical measurements. However, researchers need further evidence and human studies to support these findings.

There have been some concerns about the effects of aspartame on the central and peripheral nervous systems.

A2021 reviewhighlights research that suggests long-term use of aspartame may increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, including:

Long-term aspartame use may adversely affect the sciatic nerve in the lower back.

Future human studies may help scientists find out more about the effects of aspartame on nerve structure and function.

Other associated risks of aspartame

Research in the2021 reviewsuggests that aspartame may also affect or cause:

long-term changes in behavior

memory and learning difficulties

changes in blood corticosterone levels

Cardiovascular health

Recent research also highlights a potential link between aspartame and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. For example, a2023 reviewsuggests that research links long-term use of artificial sweeteners with a higher risk of the following:

insulin resistanceandhigh blood sugar

dyslipidemia— high levels of lipids in the blood

The researchers state that further research is necessary for experts to understand the potential link between artificial sweeteners and cardiovascular health.

A2022 studyevaluated the artificial sugar intake of an online cohort of 103,388 people. They found an association between artificial sugar intake and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Specifically, they associated aspartame intake with a higher risk of strokes.

A report from theU.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesassessed a number of studies looking at the potential risks of aspartame.

The report highlights inconsistent, limited evidence that suggests a possible link between aspartame and some hematopoietic cancers in males, although researchers require further evidence from human studies.

TheInternational Agency for Research on Cancerclassifies aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” Other substances in this categoryincludelead and gasoline engine exhaust fumes.

Experts suggest there are no significant safety concerns for aspartame consumption at the ADI of 40 mg/kg.

Who should avoid aspartame?

Phenylketonuria (PKU)is a genetic metabolic disorder that increases levels of the essential amino acid known as phenylalanine in the blood. People with PKU areunableto metabolize phenylalanine properly, so they will need to avoid or limit their intake of it.

Phenylalanine isone of two amino acidsthat make up aspartame. Aspartame provides significantly lower amounts of phenylalanine than everyday food sources, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products.

People with PKU need to monitor all dietary sources of phenylalanine to avoid toxic levels. As a result,all productscontaining phenylalanine in the United States carry a label.

Products containing aspartame

Many foods and drinks that carry the label “sugar-free” may contain some form of artificial sweetener.

The followingcould containaspartame:

low-fat flavored milk

low-fat or light ice cream and popsicles

low-calorie tabletop sweeteners, such as Equal

some prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including chewable vitamins

Alternatives to aspartame

Those wishing to limit their intake of aspartame may want to try an alternative natural sweetener, such as:

There is still much controversy surrounding the safety of aspartame, despite approval from authorities around the world.

Some evidence suggests aspartame may have adverse effects on health. However, further studies in humans is necessary to support many of these findings.

Organizations such as the FDA have approved aspartame as safe for human consumption within a certain daily limit.
