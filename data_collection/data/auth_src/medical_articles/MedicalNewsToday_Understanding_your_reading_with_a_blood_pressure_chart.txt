Blood pressure readings indicate the force of blood against blood vessel walls, and understanding these numbers is crucial for monitoring heart health and overall well-being.

Healthy blood pressure ranges for adults are categorized as normal, elevated, and various stages of hypertension, with the systolic number being a key indicator of heart disease risk for individuals over 50.

Lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management can help maintain healthy blood pressure, while regular check-ups and home monitoring can aid in early detection and management of hypertension or hypotension.

Keep reading for more information about blood pressure and blood pressure readings.

What is blood pressure?

Blood pressure refers to the force that blood puts on the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. Healthcare professionals measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

Doctors can use blood pressure as an indicator of a person’s heart health. People with high blood pressure (hypertension) areat riskof developing heart problems and damage to the walls of the blood vessels.

Low blood pressure (hypotension)can beassociated with underlying health conditions. However, some people have low blood pressure all the time, and that can be typical for them.

If blood pressure falls too low, it can cause people to feel dizzy or light-headed. In severe cases, hypotension can compromise blood flow to the organs, increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke.

A blood pressure reading has two numbers, which people often call the upper (systolic) and lower (diastolic) numbers. Systolic is the top number on the reading and is the higher one. Diastolic is the lower number.

Although a doctor can use both numbers to diagnose high blood pressure, the systolic number can be amore significantindicator of a person’s risk forheart diseasein those over 50.

These numbers are for adults. A parent or caregiver should talk with a child’s doctor about healthy ranges for children, as age, weight, and sex can all affect these numbers.

Risks of hypertension

If a person has hypertension, their blood pressure is too high. When a person is hypertensive, they are at an increased risk of developing conditions,such as:

atherosclerosis, which is a buildup of plaque in the arteries

In most cases, there are no symptoms of high blood pressure. However, a person who is experiencing a hypertension crisis due toelevated blood pressurelevels may experience the following symptoms:

change in vision or blurry vision

shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs

Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment.

When a person hassevere hypotension, their blood pressure is too low.

Though many doctors often stress the importance of lowering blood pressure, it is possible for someone’s blood pressure to be too low.

People with very low blood pressure may experience the following symptoms:

dizziness/lightheadedness

injury from falling or loss of consciousness

organ damage in severe cases

How to maintain a healthy blood pressure

People’s blood pressure is partially due to factors they cannot control, such as:

chronic kidney disease

However, there are also many steps a person can take to prevent high blood pressure. These include:

eating a healthful diet that includes fruits, vegetables,lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates

exercising regularly, particularlycardioworkouts such as walking, cycling, or running

limitingalcoholconsumption

restricting consumption of processed foods

limitingsodiumintake to less than 2 grams daily

managing and regulating diabetes

working toward and maintaining a healthy BMI

taking steps to reduce and manage stress

When to contact a doctor

If a person experiences any symptoms of critical hypertension, they should seek immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications.

A person should also receive regular blood pressure readings at check-ups with their doctor or other healthcare professionals.

However, a person can also take their blood pressure at home using an over-the-counterblood pressure monitor. If the blood pressure reader indicates a person has high or low blood pressure, they should talk with their doctor.

Blood pressure is one indicator of a person’s heart health. If the pressure is too high, it can lead to serious health complications and potentially death.

Though not all causes of elevated blood pressure are preventable, a person can reduce their risk of complications by managing their lifestyle and minimizing risk factors for developing high blood pressure.

Anyone concerned about high or low blood pressure should speak with a doctor.
