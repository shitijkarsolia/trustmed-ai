Blood pressure should typically be stable. If a person has regularly fluctuating blood pressure, medications, lifestyle changes, and home remedies may help regulate it.

A person’sblood pressureusually varies slightly throughout the day. However, if it regularly fluctuates, this will often require monitoring and management.

It is important that a medical professional checks a person’s fluctuating blood pressure regularly, as it can reveal a lot about the person’s health.

Causes of fluctuating blood pressure

Below are several factors that can cause dangerous fluctuations in blood pressure.

White coat hypertension

This term describes blood pressure that is higher at the doctor’s office, often because the person is anxious about the appointment.

White coathypertensionis not necessarily as concerning as consistently high blood pressure.

A2016 meta-analysisfound that people with white coat hypertension had a lower risk of heart disease and a better outlook than people with lasting hypertension.

However, without correct identification, white coat hypertensioncan lead toincorrect hypertension treatments, which may have negative health effects.

Certain medications can temporarily reduce blood pressure. Theyinclude:

beta-blockersand other heart medications

However, long-term stress and untreated anxietycan havelasting, harmful effects on blood pressure and overall health.
