It seems contradictory: the pills you're taking for headaches might actually be perpetuating them. Medication-overuse headache is a well-documented medical phenomenon, but the good news is it's often reversible once identified.

Over10 million peoplein the UK regularly get headaches, making up aboutone in every 25 visits to a GP. Most headaches are harmless and not a sign of a serious problem. Although many people worry they might have a brain tumor,less than 1% of those with headachesactually do.

Because there are so manypossible causes of headaches, GPs must play detective. A detailed medical history and examination are essential, sometimes followed by specialist referral.

The challenge lies in determining whether a headache signals a serious underlying cause,or is benign. Even benign headaches, however, can greatly affect a person's daily life and still need proper care.

Treatment depends on the type of headache. For example, migraines may be treated withanti-sickness medicine or beta blockers, while headaches related to anxiety or depression might improve withmental health support.Lifestyle changes, such asdietary changesand exercise, can also help manage many types of long-term headache.

However,doctors often seeanother type of persistent headache that has a clear pattern. Patients report getting repeated headaches that started or got worse after taking painkillers regularly for three months or longer.

This can happen in people withmigraines,tension headache, or other painful conditions like back orjoint pain. Some may take several types of medication, often more and more frequently, and end up stuck in a frustrating cycle that doesn't seem to make sense at first.

The probable diagnosis ismedication-overuse headaches. This condition is thought toaffect about 1–2% of peopleand isthree-to-four times more common in women.

The culprit is often the painkillers themselves. Opiates likecodeine, used to treat moderate pain from injuries or after surgery, come with along list of side-effectsincluding constipation, drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations—and headaches.

It's not just strong opiate-based medications that can cause headaches. Common painkillers like paracetamol and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen) can also play a role. Some medications even combine paracetamol with an opiate, such as co-codamol.

Paracetamol has a simplerside-effect profilecompared with drugs like codeine. When taken within the recommended daily limits—which depend onage and weight—it is generally a safe and effectivepainkiller. This has contributed to its widespread use and easy availability.

However, taking more than the recommended dose or using it too often can be very dangerous. This can lead to serious—sometimes fatal—complications, such asliver failure.

Even thoughside-effectsare less common, studies have shown that regular use ofparacetamol alonecan also trigger chronic headaches in some people.

Other drugs besides painkillers can also cause problems. Usingtriptanstoo often—medications to stop migraine attacks—can also lead to medication-overuse headaches.

The term "overuse" might make it sound like patients are taking more than the recommended daily dose, which can happen and brings its own serious risks. However, in many cases of medication-overuse headaches, patients are neither exceeding dose limitsnor taking the medication every single day.

For paracetamol or NSAIDs, medication-overuse headaches may develop if they are taken on 15 or more days per month. With opiates, headaches can appear with even less frequent use—sometimes after just ten days a month.

That's why it's important to talk to a doctor if you need to use any painkiller, even over-the-counter ones, for a long time. Not everyone will develop medication-overuse headaches, and the risk seems to differ from person to person, meaning individual susceptibility plays a big role.

Treating these headaches can be challenging. It's often hard for patients to recognize on their own that theirmedicationis causing the problem. The usual approach involvesgradually stopping the medicationunder guidance, eventually stopping it completely.

This can seem unfathomable to patients, especially since they expect painkillers like paracetamol to relieve their headaches. Some worry their pain will get worse as they cut back. That's why working closely with a doctor is essential—to confirm the diagnosis, monitor progress and plan the next steps in treatment.

If you're having headaches on more than 15 days a month, it's important to see your GP. Talking it through can help identify underlying causes and explain these often debilitating symptom patterns. Keeping aheadache diary—noting symptoms and daily details—can also support the diagnosis.

Why some medicines, especially painkillers, can makeheadachesworse isn't fully understood. However, it's important to be aware of this now well-established link and seek medical advice.

Only when some patients stop taking certain medications altogether do they discover the uncomfortable truth: that their pain was being fueled by the very drugs they depended on.
