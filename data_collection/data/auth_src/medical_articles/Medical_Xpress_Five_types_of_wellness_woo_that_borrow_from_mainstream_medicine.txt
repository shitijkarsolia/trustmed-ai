What we consider "fringe" or "mainstream" changes over time. That applies to health and medicine too.

For instance, massage was once considered a fringetherapybut in the 19th century itmorphedinto what we know today as physical therapy.

Likewise, Swiss doctor Maximilian Bircher-Benner wasn't taken seriously when he said we should eat oats and fruit for breakfast. But he was onto something:he invented muesli.

There has also been traffic in the other direction. Legitimate medical therapies have turned up in the weird health borderland of beauty and "wellness."

When untrained or barely trained people use these therapies, they can do real harm.

Here are five examples of wellness trends that borrow from mainstream medicine.

Ozone (O₃) is a form of oxygen. Ordinary oxygen (O₂), sometimes with ozone added, can be applied to wounds via a bag or sealed chamber tohelp them heal. It does this by helping the bodyfight infection and form collagen.

But "ozone therapy"—the weird, unlicensed version—puts ozone, or ozone and oxygen,directly into the person's body. It can go in via the lungs, or via intravenous injection, or it can be pumped into the rectum or vagina.

Practitioners claim it can reduce inflammation, or even treat cancer orHIV/AIDS, despite no evidence for such health benefits.

It can also causefatal air embolisms—bubbles of gas in the bloodstream that can block blood flow to vital organs.

If you don't get enough of a certain vitamin or mineral through your diet, you can take a supplement. But if that doesn't work, in some cases, you might need to go to hospital or adoctor's officeto get a medically supervised infusion that's delivered into the vein (an IV infusion).

For instance,iron infusionshelp people with serious iron deficiencies.

Butcelebrity endorsementshave helped fuel the rise of "vitamin drips" at wellness centers and therapy lounges. These dripspromiseall sorts of outcomes, from boosting your immune system, to treating pain or depression.

IV needles in untrained hands can be dangerous. Theycan causephlebitis (inflammation of the vein) and infiltration (when the IV fluid or medication leaks into the surrounding areas). They can also lead toinfection.

And unlike therapeutic vitamin IV infusions administered in hospital, these non-traditional treatments are not regulated by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. So you might also not be getting the magic IV potion you're paying for.

The bacteriumClostridium botulinumproduces a neurotoxin—a poison that affects nerves. For decades, it's been used therapeutically to treat excess sweating and migraine, among other conditions. Today, we call this neurotoxin Botox.

Since about the 1990s,health professionalshave been injecting it into people's faces to temporarily paralyze the muscles that cause wrinkles.

It's legal, it's a registered product, and in trained hands it's safe to use.

But as of September 2 this year, it's been wrapped in an extra layer of regulation.

People who deliver any non-surgical cosmetic procedures—including Botox—will now be required to demonstrate higher skill levelsunder tougher policies.

This comes afterseveral caseswhere nurses allegedlyimported injectablesfrom overseas. But these products weren't registered for use in Australia and may not have been safe to use.

Apheresis is the process of separating blood into its component parts by spinning it at high speed in a special machine.

Clinicians use this process to separate out and remove specific molecules or antibodies in some diseases—what's called "selective apheresis."

For example, if a person has very high cholesterol that doesn't respond to normal treatments, they can undergolipid apheresisto "wash out" harmful lipoproteins from their blood.

It's easy to see how the idea of "washing" your blood could be misunderstood and misapplied.

English actor Orlando Bloom announced earlier this year that he'd undergone apheresis toremove microplastics from his blood.

Microplastics in the body are acause for concern—but there's no evidence to suggest apheresis can cleansehuman bloodof them.

5. Hyperbaric therapy

When a diver gets "the bends" from too much nitrogen forming in their body, they can be treated in ahyperbaric oxygen chamber, where they receive 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber.

But hyperbaric therapy is also touted as a treatment forautism,Alzheimer's disease, cancer,strokes, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

There isn't enough good science to back up any of these claims. There also isn't enough science to suggest itmakes your skin look younger.

The history of medicine isfull of storiesabout when mainstream forms of medicine have harmed instead of healed.

Humans have alsoalways wanted to manage their own health. This has been going on for centuries, with both risks and benefits.

But just because a therapy has been used in a hospital for one reason doesn't necessarily mean it works in a wellness clinic for another.

People can be easilyconvincedby aggressively marketed wellness therapies, which can be magnified by social media andcelebrity endorsements.

However, these therapiescan come witha lack of evidence to support their wider uses, and they may harm.

Caveat emptor—let the buyer beware.
