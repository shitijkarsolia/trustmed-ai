In children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) improve glycemic, weight, and cardiometabolic outcomes, according to a studypublishedinJAMA Pediatrics.

Pareeta Kotecha, Pharm.D., from the University of Florida in Gainesville, and colleagues examined the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs inchildrenandadolescentswith obesity, prediabetes, or T2D in asystematic review. Data were included from 18 randomized controlled trials, with 1,402 participants (838 GLP-1 RA users and 564 receiving placebo).

The researchers found significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (−0.44%), fasting glucose (−9.92 mg/dL), body weight (−3.02 kg), body mass index (BMI; 1.45 kg/m2), BMI standard deviation score (−0.20), BMI percentile (−7.24%), andsystolic blood pressure(−2.73 mm Hg) in association with GLP-1 RAs and an increase in gastrointestinal adverse effects (log rate ratio, 0.75). No significant differences were seen in other adverse events, including suicidal ideation or behaviors.

"This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and risks associated with GLP-1 RAs in the pediatric population, enabling patients, caregivers, and clinicians to make more informed treatment decisions," the authors write.
