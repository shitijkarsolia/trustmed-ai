    "selftext": "I have had type 1 since 2006 at 7 years old and have never felt my lows. The lowest I have ever gone was 28, which resulted in me falling and splitting open my lip at 8 years old, which helped me/my family realize I was unable to feel them. Thankfully, the other night, I was able to see myself physically shaking and knew something was up. I was eating a late meal with my partner and could barely hold my fork up with how bad I was shaking. I try very hard to stay within my target zone but have been much more active this week with moving to a new apartment, and it has had my blood sugar all over the place this past week. I am no longer on a pump and use pens to inject/prick my finger to check where I’m at. After this scare, it’s safe to say I finally want to go on a glucose sensor. Has anyone else dropped this low? How did you feel, if so? ",

    "selftext": "This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3\" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. \n\nOn December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, \"What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" I responded, \"Treat my what now?\" And he said, \"Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician.\" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. \n\nMy primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. \n\nI did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. \n\nFor my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. \n\nAfter 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. \n\nWhen I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate \"when I felt hungry\" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. \n\nIn June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. \n\nIn July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. \n\nThis has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. \n\nI hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades. \n\nDose | Duration | A1C | BMI | Start Weight | End Weight | lbs lost | Total Lost | Lost/wk\n----|--------|---|---|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------\n0 | 5 weeks | 10.2 | 40.62 | 325 | 318 | 7 | 7 | 1.3 lb/wk\n2.5 | 4 weeks | --- | 39.74 | 318 | 300 | 18 | 25 | 3.0 lb/wk\n5.0 | 4 weeks | --- | 37.49 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 45 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 4 weeks | 6.2 | 34.62 | 280 | 277 | 3 | 48 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 12 weeks | 5.4 | 32.24 | 277 | 258 | 19 | 67 | 2.28\n10 | 16 weeks | --- | 28.12 | 258 | 225 | 33 | 100 | 2.21",

If it's not in control, then you need to talk to your doctor again, for both advice and maybe more medication. You need to make lifestyle changes if at all possible. Doctor will be helpful for that, but a CGM (if possible, ik they are often expensive) and limiting foods high in carbs and basic sugars are a good place to start. For me, bread and pasta shoots my sugars through the roof, so I avoid them when I can.\n\nSome days WILL be worse then others. Sometimes I'm dumb and have to deal with high sugars for awhile because I really wanted that slice of pizza. You don't need to be perfect, you just need to try to do as good as you can, and to make more good decisions over bad ones.\n\nWish you the best of luck. I was on insulin, but got off it.

He went to a specialized foot doctor today and they said that he probably has Charcot foot. He also has an ulcer on the bottom of his foot. My dad is the only worker in the house and if he can’t work we’re essentially screwed. So the doctor said he needs to rest and stay off his feet and wear a boot. But he works in a factory where he has to constantly stand. He has the ulcer clean and protected under bamdages and he has braces on his feet to help provide some stability. He has some reinforced shoes coming in soon that he can wear to work as well. So with all that said I wish he wouldn’t but I also know there really isn’t a choice. We would use FMLA but we had to use it a year ago for an open heart surgery /and that won’t renew until April 29. So is there any way he can continue on working under the conditions he works with the proper care given to his feet. He can’t wear the boot to work but he can wear it around the house and he can rest all he wants.

I’m not a fan of shit like vegetables, and my entire teenage years has been filled with me just- vegging. \n\nAs a child, I was really, really active. Ballet, Tap, Piano, Girl Scouts, Swim Team, soccer. Not all at once, but I was in at least 2 things, and my weekdays were mostly spent out of the house until after dark. I ate relatively healthily (well- relatively is a strong word) and I was in the correct weight bracket for my age… until COVID hit. \n\nI’d everything but Girl Scouts right before it, just not having motivation anymore. But we still lived in a fairly large house in a safe neighborhood. Then, right around my 13th birthday, we moved. We moved from a large 2 story in a safe, child- filled neighborhood with sidewalks and bikes everywhere, to a 1 story less than a third of the size of our old house, in a neighborhood that despite having a tone of children, has no sidewalks and most everybody parks on the curb, even if there is space in the driveway. It’s not safe to ride bikes or scooters, and hardly safe enough to walk a dog or just take a walk. And again, COVID started up right after we moved, so me and my family were cooped up in this new, small, strange place, all 8 of us (5 people, 3 dogs). \n\nMom stopped going to CrossFit, dad got laid off and went back to his old job as a car salesman. My sister was at a friend’s house all the time, and my brother was moving out to live with his girlfriend. I had no friends to escape to, or hang out with, and my Girl Scout group rarely saw eachother outside of meetings, which happened 2 times a month. I put on a lot of weight VERY quickly, shooting from roughly 100 pounds at 13 to 140 at 14, and it kept increasing. I went from a junior 7 to an adults 12 in less than 4 years, and then from a 12 to a 18 in less than 3. It’s not great, and it’s not healthy. \n\nI know I could have done better. Joined a sport, a club, anything to fix my situation, get myself out of the house, and take more than 600 steps a day for a year. School started up, and those numbers barely changed. I was taking 5000 steps a day, but other than art club (where I was sitting on my ass the whole time), I didn’t really go anywhere. And yet, I found myself happiness, so I figured I was doing something right despite my physical weight. \n\nThen, my doctor got concerned. My A1C was high for my age, and my weight was 220 at only 17 years old. I hadn’t even graduated highschool yet, and my doctor feared the worst for me. She told me I needed to fix things, and I had a mental breakdown in the parking lot. \n\nI tried to change things. My mother and I looked at alternative brands, ingredients. I stopped eating canned chili (used to be my favorite thing) bc the sodium in there was more than a ramen packet. We tried cutting sodas from the house, I tried to go to the gym, or do home exercise videos, and walked more. \n\nBut nothing stuck. Mom and I both had lives to live outside of that. Journey, and it kept getting pushed to the side. Without my mother to guide me, I was lost and unmotivated, and started to hate my body again. \n\nWhat people don’t tell you is that it’s hard to get yourself out of a “potato” stage. For me, my mental health is HEAVILY reliant on my physical health and confidence, and my health and confidence is reliant on my mental health. If one sucks, the other sucks too, and it’s a self pitying, deprecating, awful cycle that I actively try to break. \n\n6 months ago, I went to the doctor and my A1C rose again, making me feel motivated to fix it. And For a while, we did good again! We went to the actual gym, ate well, tracted calories, did everything the internet told us to do, but slowly it happened again. We went to the gym less. “Another day” or “tomorrow” kept being said. I was left home alone or to my devices for dinner more often, and my lazy ass went for the “easy” stuff. Not what was good for me. \n\nAnd then, a little over a week ago. I got the news, that my A1C was 6.7. I was officially in diabetic territory. And I lost it. Sobbed, screamed at myself, threw things, cursed more than I have before. I’m not proud of my reaction, but most 18 year olds would have the same one. And we went to the doctor. \n\nNow, I’m on like- 3 medications to help manage it while I figure out how the fuck I lose my weight, how I reverse what I’d done to myself. I knew I had more risk than others because of my family history, with mom being at risk, and my moms family all having it, but it never really hit me until it well and truly got me, if that makes sense. I don’t know what to do. I try to have a positive mindset, but just looking down at myself ruins my mood. I try to exercise, but it’s hard to when you are surrounded by a mirror at the gym or at home, and I can see how much of a potato I look like. I genuinely have no part of myself I’m proud of. My rolls and stomach are disgusting to me, and I have no way of hiding them, my legs are filled with cellulite, my face is red and splotchy thanks to rosacea BC OF MY DIET ISSUES, my mind is mentally fucked over, and I can’t fix it because my mental health is tied to my physical health and confidence for me. \n\nI’m not trying to pity myself, I know what I did wrong. But if someone out there could give me advice on how you manage it, or anything to help, that’d be… great. ",

        "body": "First, you aren't a bad person and diabetes is not a punishment for poor lifestyle. Is it a contributing factor? yeah. But without the genetic component it wouldn't matter. There are people out there living the exact same life without diabetes because their genes don't have diabetic markers. They will probably have other health concerns but not diabetes. \n\nAsk your doctor about a diabetes education class. I just did one, it was roughly 10 hours. We covered a lot. But the research is updated every year so continuing education is important. This is your health and you shouldn't be guessing. You need to know the risks and the consequences and your best chance at success. \n\nI get that you are mad about this. That is a natural reaction. It's honestly one of the stages of grief. I don't know what will get you to acceptance but you need to do that so you can figure everything out for yourself. \n\nDiabetes is different for everyone. There is no perfect plan that everyone can follow. You have to problem solve and figure out what works for you. The start of problem solving is gathering information. Test your blood sugar and figure out your baseline. \n\nThere are three components to managing diabetes; diet, exercise, and medicine. If you take medicine, it doesn't make you a bad diabetic. It makes you a diabetic using medicine to help control your blood sugar. \n\nThe general rule is 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. Walking is great. So is dance, bike riding, yoga, swimming, etc... You can do 30 minutes for 5 days a week or 50 minutes 3 days a week. I try to do 20 minutes 7 days a week. But I don't do it all at once. I do 5 + minutes 4 times a day.  I was surprised it worked for me. It's easy to fit 5 minutes of walking at work but 10 to 20 minutes would be a distraction from my job. \n\nAlso, drink 64 ounces of plain water every day. Limit your carbs. Like get your burger without the bun sort of stuff. Eat your veggies (non starchy veggies) first to slow down your digestion and eat carbs last. \n\nMost importantly, work with your doctor to figure out what works for you. You have to be deliberately healthy. And the best reason to do it is for yourself.",

I’m going to keep going. \n\nMy only issue is I have these headaches that are like pressure almost and I can’t shake them. I thought it’s because I started eating less so I increased my eating (especially protein and fiber). They go away then they come back and they’re almost nauseating.

Diagnosed by my GP 12 years ago and put on slow and fast acting insulin about 8 months after that by the Endo who the GP referred me to. My GP calls it type 1 so I go with that. This week saw my GP and my Endo on the same day a few hours apart. I see the GP every 3 months and the Endo every 6. So every 3 months I have bloodwork done. My GP has always asked about lows and I tell her they aren't a big issue but as you all know there is going to be some. I have a cgm which alerts me at 4.2, time for me to correct before things get ugly and I manage that very well. For the past year my A1c has been between 5.6 and 5.8 which is a great improvement for me and I credit the cgm\n\nSo my GP says, it's too low, you should strive to get it around 6 or slightly higher. I say, but lower is better isn't it? She's say, ask your Endo and let me know what he says. She also suggested Ozempic and to also ask him. I did so and he says, the lower the better and maybe she is getting fasting mixed up with A1c? No she isn't but anyway he tells me I'm doing great and to keep doing it! As for Ozempic he wasn't thrilled and again says, what you're doing is working so keep it up. Tells me he would prescribe it if I want but he usually only does that for people what can't control things well or if they're over weight of which I'm not too bad. I think I'll pass on it for now. \n\nFor the ones who added Ozempic, how's it working for you? Recommended?",

Quinoa has plenty carbs in it, btw.  1 cup of Quinoa has 39g of carbs which is way over what I allow for a meal.  White rice is 45g.  I will sometimes eat one of those but I just don't each that much.\n\nYou might suggest he wear a CGM for a month or two to track what foods spike him more than others.  He'll most likely have to pay for it out of pocket but it can be super valuable to have a better understanding of what impacts.  His doctor would need to write a prescription for it and then it's probably going to be 120-150 for a month supply (one is good for two weeks).  My wife and I are both T2 and we spike to different foods.  The other thing he might learn is if he eats his protein/fats first the affect on his blood sugar will be less because his body will take longer to process the carbs.  But the CGM will give you good data of what affects *him.*\n\nI would not focus on the BUN or LDL numbers unless the doctor is actually concerned about them.

Even small amounts of exercise help increase insulin sensitivity and open our cells to receive the glucose.\n\nAre those his waking numbers? There are a couple of reasons that your blood sugar can rise while you are sleeping. \n\n1. A \"leaky liver\" which gets signals that your glucose is low in the body and it releases glucose in the bloodstream. A small snack of 15-20g of carbs before bed can actually help with that. Medicine like Metformin can help calm the liver and prevent \"leaking.\"\n\n2. Is called the Dawn Phenomenon, where hormones are released to stress your body into waking up and increase your glucose in the blood. I find that 5 minutes of moderate exercise before bed helps me maintain good blood sugar to the morning and makes my sleep more restful.\n\nSpeaking of sleep, it is very important to get a good nights rest. It helps maintain good blood sugar levels throughout the day. \n\nEat your veggies first. Fiber digests more slowly in the body and if you eat your nonstarchy veggies first it slows down your digestion. Then protein and save carbs for last.

The last 2 times I had to have my husband hold her so I could get it on and she was too scared of me to even come near me for the rest of the night.  Taking it off was just as bad as putting it on.  I don’t know how to put a new one on she has full blown panic attacks if I even touch her receiver at this point, but her blood sugar also tanked today at her friends house and I didn’t know because she doesn’t have a monitor on.  I know when she’s older she will understand how important it is but right now she doesn’t get that I don’t have an option.  I fucking hate this it breaks my heart that she has to deal with this for the rest of her life.",

    "selftext": "I had the Eversense 365 CGM procedure done 16 days ago and the device has been incredible. I went through their PASS program since it wasn’t covered by my insurance which ended being $2400 but if it’s covered by your insurance then it should be $350 plus $200 for the insertion so $550. Cheaper than a year’s worth of CGM supplies. The surgery literally was about 30 seconds and painless. The first 24 hours you don’t calibrate the sensor but the next day you calibrate it 4 times every 2 hours in total 8 hours with a glucose meter which I used the Contour NeXT. After that you calibrate it once a day for 2 weeks preferably within 1-2 hours of the chosen time. Then it becomes once a week for the remainder of the year. The phone app will notify you when to calibrate it.\nThe accuracy is great in my opinion since calibrating it, I’ve been getting glucose meter readings such as 125 and 124 on the sensor. The transmitter will vibrate on your body when you go low and doesn’t have the loud alarm on the Dexcom. You can also go for a run without bringing your phone and it’ll vibrate when you go low which means a lot to me because I don’t bring my phone when I run. Recommend anyone with the means to get it if you want better hypoglycemia detection, comfort, sensitive skin, less waste, and possibly cheaper than CGM supplies. \nTLDR: Recommend the Eversense 365 implant because it’ll last a year, less pain because no filament poking, less waste, cheaper, body vibrations instead of alarm.\nAny questions feel free to ask.",

    "selftext": "I got diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 12.6% in April 2024. I went low carb straight away, started walking and lowered my A1C to 5.6% within 6 months. I have been low carb, except a few days like christmas or birthdays where I had the occassional slice of cake or some potatoes/bread. Everytime I had carbs alone, I spiked hard like in the 200s. My doctor, however, has always been insistent that I need to eat carbs. Her guideline that she gave me has examples like 2 breadrolls or 3 potatoes or 1 cup of rice for lunch. Everytime I have eaten rice, I have spiked. So I have stayed low carb for over a year.\n\nIn my last appointment in August, my A1C was at 5.7, so borderline again, but I expected that since I was in bedrest for 2 months due to an ankle fracture. She was again very insistent that I eat more carbs and if carbs spike me so much then she could increase my medication. I take metformin 500 mg once a day and I really don't want more meds. I can barely remember to take that one pill everyday.\n\nSo I thought, fuck it, I'm going to eat more carbs and when the next blood test happens the results will show her why I'm low carb. I ate *almost unrestricted* for the last three months. I ate rice, not daily but definitely more than before, I had bread regularly, I ate croissants and puff pastries for breakfast twice a week or so, I ate chocolates, snacked on chips in bed, I even had cakes and ice cream. I also finished a whole pack of Spekulatius biscuits within a week a couple weeks ago (these are full of sugar and just eating 5 spiked me to 240). I knew I was damaging my body but I wanted to prove a point really.\n\nMy blood test was on Tuesday and I just got my results. My A1C is at 5.5% and my Cholesterol has improved. I am reeling with confusion. What the fuck happened?",

    "selftext": "After years of awful doctors I went through, who wouldn't listen to my struggle with diabetes. I finally got an endo who diagnosed me with Type 1.5, over type 1. In my early 20s I struggled so hard on keeping my blood sugar leveled, until I was 23 and had my sugars go over 400 night after night, until about new years before I turned 24, where I switched full time to a keto diet.\n\nIve been on a keto diet for almost 5 years now, but my last appointment with my new endo prescribed me metformin again (I was taken off it entirely bc I was told it wouldnt work when I was 20, even tho I kept telling my previous endo I had insulin resistance issues and he wouldn't help me with type 2 meds in the slightest).\n\nAnywho, within the past couple years, it's become increasingly difficult to sustain being on keto anymore. I haven't taken my metformin that I was prescribed in september, mostly because \n\n1. too scared to try it yet\n\n2. I wanna build up a supply of metformin before I start\n\n3. In the past couple months I was able to consistently keep my sugars below 200 majority of the time.\n\nI wanna transition out of keto so bad. I have to eat a lot of food, especially meat, because Ill get severe hunger pangs if I don't. To the point that I believe it's affecting my blood pressure negatively. I have to eat a lot of salt, so I don't get those low blood pressure symptoms. And I think now I'm starting to have my blood pressure go from high to low, a lot.\n\nHere's some points about my current medical situation\n\n1. Im on an insulin pump (endo wants to try out me with my insulin pump on with 0.9 hourly basal)\n\n2. I was prescribed 500mg slow-release metformin pills that Im supposed to take once a day.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if I have to take it really slow.",

I also know farxiga can have other protective benefits, but also that any meds come with risks. \n\nSo, how did yall decide to try life sans meds, or why do yall continue meds?

It hit me one day with a flu like illness where my son brought me to the E R with sugar of over 600 - you are now diabetic - work on your log, keep your aic and glucose low and try everything - every person is different, keto helps most, vegan helps others you have to find your path, omad helps me that knowledge comes after years of trying different diets, when not on omad the Mediterranean diet worked for me.  Instead of a second opinion, focus on what works for you.  Cheat days are okay but remember to balance it and keep hydrated your meds are flushing sugars into your bladder/liver etc so fluid keeps that system flowing.  Good luck!",

Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia. \nIn October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.",

In India these programs run cheap and rely mostly on coaches. In the US the successful ones (Virta, Omada, Livongo, Signos, Lark Health) work because they plug directly into insurance and employer health plans. The money doesn’t really come from the patient, it comes from insurers reimbursing remote monitoring, telehealth, and diabetes-care codes.\n\nIn the US you need actual clinicians, not just coaches, to adjust meds, monitor CGM data, and bill Medicare/insurance. You also need HIPAA compliance, FDA-safe workflows, and state-licensed telehealth. The upside is much higher revenue: US companies can bill around 1500 to 3500 dollars a year per patient, plus recurring monthly reimbursement for remote monitoring. The downside is higher acquisition cost, higher regulation, and more complexity. I hope that answers your quest, or it may be irrelevant.  I just took a chance.",

Obviously pizza, pastries, crisps are off the table for now. I eat stir fried veg, fish, meat, quark (like Greek yogurt), eggs, cheese, spinach, and I eat chia seed pudding in the mornings (chia seeds, Stevia, cinnamon powder, milk, and almond extract - mix leave in fridge for a couple of hours or overnight). I occasionally eat wholemeal bread - eggs on toast. I switched to Stevia instead of sugar. \n\nThe solution will be a combination of drugs (everyone gets Metformin but there are others too they are all good) and diet and exercise if you can, just walking after meals helps the post meal spike. \n\nReducing saturated fats in my diet was really helpful. \n\nI use an app loseit to track nutrients. It's immensely helpful I aim for \n\nCarbs - less than 130 grams per day\nSat fats - less than 20 grams per day \nFibre - at least 30 grams per day (fibre doesn't convert to blood sugar hence chia seeds 90% fibre - they expand so not dry). Hemp hearts are incredible and full of healthy fat and go well with yoghurt or quark. \n\nWhen your blood sugar levels are back under control you can reintroduce carbs back into your diet, type 2 diabetics can eat mostly everything in small quantities. \n\nIf you are a habitual snacker or sweet eater you are likely to crave and thats okay just make the distance between snacking longer and longer each time. \n\nYou probably didn't want war &amp; peace just wanted to say I've been there and it gets better",

It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Heck, not even a marathon: it’s literally the rest of your life. There’s room to mess things up in the beginning before you get them sorted out!\n\nThird: enjoy your birthday! You’re going to make long term changes and get everything under control, and no single day or single meal is going to kill you. That’s the advantage of type 2 over type 1, to be fair: left unmanaged, T2 makes for a horrible death, but thankfully, it takes a long time to get there, and the fact that you’re here in this group, asking for help, so soon after diagnosis, that’s a really good indicator that you’re not going to be going out that way.\n\nOne of my favorite statistics that I’ve read on this journey is that people with t2 who manage it, and keep their glucose under control, actually live longer lives than the general population. So if you want to, you can get this wrapped up and under control and be just fine. \n\nLast thing, the time frame: the first few weeks are rough and it’s totally ok to go through all the emotions, and shame, and grief or whatever. Then you’ll take a few months to get your best practices in line and under control. By about six months, you’ll see positive results and start testing better and feeling better, and the whole exercise becomes easier and you get more confident about things. So: hang in there. Don’t panic. Keep reading this sub. All the answers are here! And good luck.",

Of course there's A LOT of room for improvement but hey.

    "selftext": "I'll keep this as short as possible. I am 35 and was diagnosed with T1 in my mid-20s. I maintained pretty good control for many years, with my A1C bouncing between 5 and 6. I went off the rails a couple of years ago after developing severe anxiety over hypos (specifically one that occurred just after a basal injection, which mortified me) and as a result, began letting my BG run far too high. I finally started seeing a therapist a few months ago to deal with this and have gotten less afraid of taking my insulin and been more aggressive. Two months ago my A1C was nearly 15 (yeah, *I know*) but I have since brought it down to 10 and am continuing to make progress.\n\nIn the last week,, I have begun experiencing pretty noticeable numbness in my feet (specifically around my big toe, especially on my left foot) and tingling/pins-and-needles/burning sensations. When my BG was at its worst, I had occasional foot irritation but not this level of sensations, specifically the numbness. It really alarmed me because it seemed to come out of nowhere and I know that my A1C is going in the right direction.\n\nI did some reading and it appears that some people experience something known as \"treatment-induced diabetic neuropathy\" which comes on when A1C levels are lowered more than 2-3% in a relatively short timespan. I suspect this is what I am experiencing as it seems to make sense with the timing of things. What scares me is that in many people's accounts of this phenomenon, they describe it as becoming unbearably painful and I fear that as my BG improves, the pain/numbness is going to get much worse. I read that the suggestion for avoiding TIND is to lower the A1C gradually (i.e. around 2% every three months or so), but at that rate it would take me far longer than I'd like to bring things back to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nI am seeing a diabetes educator this week to help further get myself on track and am wondering if they may be a good resource to talk about this. I see my endocrinologist again in a little less than two months. Based on the timing and progress, I cannot help but think that TIND is what I am experiencing. Strangely, I'd never heard of it before, nor has my endocrinologist ever mentioned it. I am curious if anyone else here has experienced this and has any insight or stories. As I said, it seemed to come on out of nowhere and it frankly really freaked me out.",

No feet issues at all yet.\n\nMade immediate changes to diet- heavily cut back on carbs, quit all sugary foods, drinks etc., started taking metformin (and later long-acting insulin)\n\nMay- about 5-6 weeks after diagnosis, seeing improvement with my BS, but neuropathy kicks in with my feet. Quickly gets so bad at night that I can't sleep anymore, feet feel like they're on FIRE. Doctor writes a prescription for gabapentin, which helps significantly and allows me to sleep/function again.\n\nOctober- A1C is down to 4.7 six months after diagnosis.

Eat it once, take your normal amount of insulin and write down your numbers before, and every 30 minutes throughout for the next 4 hours. Also include your activity level. \n\nIf you spike into the 200s and have relatively low activity, try it again with a single variable change -- either be more active or take more insulin, write it down again.\n\nTry it at least half a dozen times. Your goal is to get incremental changes that are better, not bomb your sugar levels. \n\nYou'll get better at guestimating what you need, when, and how long it'll take.

The pump was fine but the sensor was so bad it was not usable. 5 years ago I switched to omnipod dash and dexcom g6 and it was great. Now my doctor wants me to switch to 780g. I'm excited about the new pump but that means I would need to use the guardian again. Last time I had guardian sensor it lost connection all the time and often gave inaccurate readings. It is also really difficult to put on by yourself. I have grown from a teenager to a young adult in the time I have used dexcom so I'm hoping the guardian will work better for me now. I would really appreciate your experiences and possible tips living with the guardian sensor. I'm also a swimmer so would like to hear about swimming with the guardian.

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 3 years ago. It sucks, basically, I eat really really healthy now. I've lost over 50 pounds in the last 3 years and am in the best shape of my life. But eating healthy is soooo boring. I don't cheat because I don't want to die. I've tried some of the diabetic Ice creams out there and they kind of suck. Like so much that after a few bites, I've thrown the whole container away. I'd given up on ever having ice cream or anything like it again. \n\nBut I do regularly eat the no sugar added yogurt with some protein powder and other supplements all mixed in with a few berries. This has been my go to first meal of he day for some time.   \nMy wife saw a commercial the other day about a new ice cream maker the Shark Ninja CREAMi Swirl and how it can turn just about anything into ice cream or soft serve. She bought the machine last week and took my daily yogurt and just froze it. The next night she put it in the Ninja Swirl and made soft serve frozen yogurt for me. OMG, it was better frozen! So good, healthy, safe, no spikes, just good old fashioned frozen yogurt like I use to buy at the ice cream shops. Now I'm making all sorts of different flavors and concoctions. \n\nIt is super easy to do and clean up, I think to make a batch it takes a few minutes, and to clean up you just rinse it and the pint bowl in the dishwasher. If anyone loves icecream like I do, I'd suggest you try something similar. Has given me a new viable dessert option and when you are a diabetic, any new safe food option that you actually enjoy and look forward to is amazing! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdhri3fyvn0g1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28725bcf03092235346d8bc2cce98e98f49cc7c6\n\n",

Older men with long-standing diabetes often have low testosterone and poor nutrient absorption, which can cause rapid muscle loss.\n\nMany diabetics undereat protein out of fear of raising glucose. But protein minimally affects blood sugar and helps protect lean mass. Aim for 1.2–1.6 g per kg body weight daily, from sources like eggs, poultry, fish, whey isolate, Greek yogurt, tofu, etc.\n\nWhey isolate in particular is quick-digesting and shown to improve glucose control and muscle recovery when paired with resistance exercise.\n\nEven 15–20 minutes a few times per week makes a big difference. Bodyweight exercises or resistance bands can help reactivate muscle growth, improve insulin sensitivity, and stabilize blood sugar.\n\nAs for supplements etc.\n\n* **Magnesium glycinate or citrate** – supports insulin signaling\n* **Creatine monohydrate (3 g/day)** – safe for most people with normal kidney function and helps preserve strength.  Any company that sells CreaPure certified. eg. NutriCost, which has both certified &amp; non-certified.  Choose CreaPure.\n* **Omega-3 (krill oil)** – anti-inflammatory and supports muscle protein synthesis.  Krill Oil gets absorbed much better than fish oils.\n* **Vitamin D3 + K2** – helps muscle and bone strength\n* **HMB (β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate)** This is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that directly reduces muscle protein breakdown. It’s one of the few supplements with strong evidence in older adults and people losing muscle from inactivity or chronic disease. Typical dose: **3 g per day**, split in two or three doses. It’s safe, doesn’t affect glucose, and works best when combined with light resistance training and adequate protein intake. I use NatureBell (Amazon)\n* **L-Glutamine** Glutamine is conditionally essential during illness or metabolic stress, and diabetics often have lower plasma glutamine levels. It helps maintain intestinal integrity, supports immune function, and can modestly aid recovery after workouts. However, for pure muscle-building purposes, it’s not as potent as HMB or creatine. Think of it more as a “recovery and gut health” amino acid. Typical dose: **5–10 g once or twice daily**, ideally between meals or post-workout. I use MicroIngredients (Amazon)\n\nIf his kidney function is normal, HMB, L\\_Glutamine &amp; Creatine can be used safely — but HMB will have the most direct effect on preventing further muscle loss, while glutamine helps overall recovery and glucose stability under stress.",

It usually takes a few days for things to start normalizing.\n\nThe problem is there’s so much misinformation out there. Everyone focuses on carbs and blood sugar spikes, but few realize that fat plays a big role too. Sure, fat doesn’t directly raise blood sugar, but saturated fat can make your body more insulin resistant, which is what leads to those stubborn numbers. Hepatic insulin resistance is the main reason for Dawn phenomenon.\n\nYou should also consider adding resistance training.

My gyno about idk 3 years ago said I had insulin resistance with some testing she had done and started me on keto. I went from 125-105lbs and we started me slowly introducing carbs and what not in. She ended up leaving the area and after about 1.5 years of keto i started to go back to normal ways. About 2 weeks ago we did labs with my rheumatologist and one was a glucose which the level was 58. I wasnt fasting i had ate a sandwhich and some chips as i have morning meds to take. Labs were at 130pm. Well today i have an appointment with the rheumatologist to go over labs and basic follow up appointment stuff. I also have lupus POTS fibromyalgia..I had asked about the lab and he said it was a fluke and im to young to have diabetes. Wondering if anyone else has been told this? For me it was alarming to have a blood sugar of 58 knowing I wasn't fasting that day either. He wasn't concerned brushed it off like they do.. I feel like its something I want to look into because my dad and his sister both have type 2 diabetes. Just looking for some general advice or input? Should I ask my primary here in town? Rheumatologist is 2 hours away and we did a video appointment for this one. Just feel defeated. I understand it isn't a huge deal but it was a little bit for me.

When it's connected to diabetes, what happens is your blood sugar goes too high right after eating and then crashes down a couple hours later. This can happen because the body senses it's not responding to the high blood sugar and then pumps out all the insulin it can, and then the insulin kicks in and causes the blood sugar to drop too much. This can happen because of LADA (slow onset type 1 in adults) or fluctuating insulin resistance (ie you did some exercise after eating that lowered your insulin resistance so all the insulin your body was pumping out could suddenly work effectively). You can pick up a blood glucose meter over the counter at the pharmacy/drug store to check your own blood sugar throughout the day if you are concerned, then bring those numbers to your primary doctor.",

If you have your last meal at 8pm and then your next one at 6/7/8am, that is all the fasting your body needs.\n\n\nI'd suggest you go back to a more normal regiment of eating (3-4 meals a day) and control your BG via good food choices and regular exercise if possible. If not, it might be worth thinking about medication. While it is great if you can control diabetes via dietary choices/changes, these shouldn't be so extreme as to cause additional issues.\n\n\nHowever it is important to keep in mind something else entirely could be causing your current issues.\n\n\nBest of luck!",

Been pre-diabetic forever.  Male, 50’s, 6’, 350.  Started a new glucose monitor.  If I don’t eat for 12 hours it will go down to about 180.  I’m incredibly shaky at that point.  As soon as I eat something with carbs it will shoot right up to 350 or even higher.  It’s so high that my monitor tops out at 350 and flatlines on the graph.  I’m not eating too crazy just like 2 hamburgers or some slices of pizza or even a baked potato.  They just started me on insulin twice a day and they said 8 units but I bumped it up to 10.  I’m always exhausted.  As soon as my glucose gets close to 350 I become even more exhausted and have to go right to bed.  I’m spending up to 20 hours a day in bed just getting up to use the bathroom and eat and then repeating the process.  The only time my glucose did not shoot up was when I cooked and ate plain chicken thighs.  I didn’t like eating all meat though so was still hungry.  I know I need to buy low carb but I have been eating up the carb food I have on hand before I start low carb mode.  Any tips for me?  I’ve been watching videos of foods to buy and eat but they don’t sound very satisfying.  I’m disabled with my back and need easy to eat quick meals I can have on hand to eat before I pass out.  I have a new Endocrinologist and Dietician but I’ve only met with each once and then once a month appointments scheduled.",

        "body": "Wow that's a lot to unpack here.  For starters, burghers &amp; pizzas etc are only going to make things worse.  When you have insulin resistance, anything that is processed or things like potatoes will spike.  When you consume saturated fats from hamburgers, bacon etc.  the fat from it creates insulin resistance in your liver.  So you will see high fasting glucose.  Also, this fat clogs up your muscles and prevents it from absorbing the glucose leading to muscular insulin resistance.  These are very simplified versions of what is actually happening. \n\nYou need to chose lean meats with as low saturated fats as possible. Even dairy like cheese etc, you can start by choosing low fat versions.  The more you avoid these things, the better it is.  I would eat chicken, fish of any kind, some eggs like not more than 3, plenty of veggies etc.  I know you said you are disabled but you can do resistance training and star with focus on your biceps, triceps, chest.  There are also back friendly leg exercises you can pickup.  Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat  &amp; improves metabolism. Also, some light 30 minute cardio in the morning on an empty stomach &amp; walking for 30 minutes after your meal will help immensely.\n\nTo make your life easy, look into getting an Instant Pot &amp; an Air fryer. \n\nYou can not tackle this with diet alone, you have to do a lifestyle change to include exercises to build muscles &amp; burn fat.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.",

Also I’ve been replacing sweet treats with keto (no sugar diet) options so look for those products to satisfy that need. But I highly recommend you to avoid burgers and pizza (at least until you have normal levels of glucose) because it’s very bad for this condition.

(there are some good sugar free ones though)\nVeggies need to be relatively low carb. A good general rule for veggies is if it grows above ground it’s usually ok to eat (there are exceptions, like corn, corn won’t do you any favors). \nLook up easy low carb or keto foods, SLOWLY introduce carbs back in (but only a small amount and only one thing at a time to see how your body reacts, the CGM is going to be a huge help with this). Even if you get spikes, it’s ok, spikes are normal even for nondiabetics, as long as the spike goes down sub 140 after 1 hour that spike is fine and normal. I understand that right now you may not ever be 140 so just… as long as it goes back down to wherever you started within 60 minutes of the spike you’re on the right track. Eventually your baseline will lower, but it takes time and work. You can do this, but get rid of the Carby foods. Donate them (sell them to a family member/friend if you have to lol) and get better food for you. \nYou know the food pyramid? This doesn’t really apply to you anymore. Try to focus on how you plate your food, go for 1/4 (give or take) lean protein (don’t forget to season!) and the 3/4 of your plate be low carb veggies. If you HAVE to have a carb right now, do it, but severely limit it until you get your baseline to something normal. By limit I mean really limit, 1-2 bites of ice cream MAX, 1/2 a small roll, a single very very small potato. But honestly until you can get that baseline down I’d avoid carbs as much as possible - reintroduce them slowly once you’re out of “I-feel-like-shitsville” 24/7.",

I understand you don't want to waste the food you have, but it's going to be that much more difficult adjusting to a low/er carb diet if you're eating nothing BUT carbs and processed food right now. Mix the high carb food with lower carb sides as you play with recipes and figure out what alternatives work for you. \n\nA fasting reading of 180 is pretty high - that's actually the peak/highest reading most endocrinologists want diabetics to see post-meal. Ideally you'd want a fasting reading between 80-100, but it may take time and effort to get there because you don't want too drastic of a drop - you may feel a false low/hypo as your levels drop because your body isn't used to what that feels like. A reading of 350+ is high and there's too much sugar in your system, which is why you feel tired/sleepy. \n\nI'm not sure where you're located, but (I'm in the US) there are some affordable low carb meals to make. Some require meal prep, or waiting for sales on certain products and stocking up if you can. In the summer I eat a lot of salads, topped with protein (usually frozen chicken strips); now that it's getting colder I'll make soup at home. Healthy Choice has low carb steamed frozen meals that are actually pretty decent; sometimes I'll add extra veggies like broccoli or bell peppers. Frozen veggies are just as good as fresh produce, and worth it if you don't get through produce before it spoils.\n\nIf you can start working in daily movement, that will also help with managing your blood sugar levels, especially after meals. Walk in place/pace around your home if walking outside isn't safe, and aim to increase how long you move every day/week. If mobility is an issue, maybe movements/exercises you can do while seated/laying down.",

You can have bad days, but whatever you did to avoid medication and lower your a1c, get used to it because it's what you'll need to do for the rest of your life. That's why it pisses me off so much when people say that it's the \"good\" type of diabetes. It's not. None of them are. Management takes complete dedication. There is no such thing as reversal of diabetes, only remission, which is also rare and difficult. The longer you go with high blood sugars, the more damage is done to your pancreas and eventually, it doesn't come back from that and you'll require insulin. \n\nLong story short: Getting your a1c down to 6 is incredible. You should be proud of yourself. Keeping it there will take a lot of work. There is no magic cure, no quick fix, etc. The fad diets are not sustainable. It's not impossible. You will have times when you slip up. But as long as you continue working on your health, you'll be okay. You need to prioritize your health. If you want to have a burger, have it, but pair it with a walk after you eat it. If you want ice cream, eat it, but add some protein beforehand and a short walk. This has to be your priority. \n\nA1c and time in range numbers don't lie.",

Basically your liver pumping out glucose but the baqsimi multiples this effect many times. \n\nSo get check out by a doc after using glucagon. The stores in the liver might not be replenished yet (again this is one of the processes affected by type 1 anyway so we don’t know how long until things are back to normal ish in top of using glucagon).  \n\nHope you’re on the mend and glad you had glucagon with you as you felt yourself passing out.",

Being affected by the summer heat my blood sugar was dropping fast in less than 1h 30. Being already full I tried not to panick and I tried correcting it with a juice box and some biscuits. After 20 minutes it was still dropping fast, I was already at 60 mg/dL still double arrows down and because it was simply too much food I threw up. Then I took a baqsimi.\n\nI immediately regretted it because I felt a horrible cranial pressure, my nostril was burning really bad and I had heart palpitations too. I don't have any medical problems with my heart. It was only a side effect of baqsimi. The heart palpitations stopped after 10-15 minutes but the cranial pressure lasted for about 7 hours. It was so bad I couldn't even keep my head straight. Fortunately, because I didn't have any food left in my stomach after I threw up, my blood sugar came up slowly and it reached a maximum of 334 mg/dL in about 3 hours. And although it wasn't an ideal outcome, it came back in range slowly but steady.\n\nSo personally I would recommend to take nothing similar to baqsimi and instead take a glucagon injection. To have a headache is bad, but to feel dizzy and then to have these horrible side effects and being panicked at the same time is worse. Never experienced such thing with glucagon injections in my 23 years of type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately glucagon injections aren't available in my country anymore.",

Happy to say I am down to 6.4 and feel great! Our goal was to get me to 6.9 just to show I can bring my A1C down and I got my results today! Proud of myself and now I’m not motivated and confident that I can take control!!",

It seems like a good idea, and I was curious if any of you folks have any experience/advice.  (Yes, I do use probiotics and fiber, yes I've been checked for other issues.

    "selftext": "This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3\" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. \n\nOn December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, \"What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" I responded, \"Treat my what now?\" And he said, \"Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician.\" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. \n\nMy primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. \n\nI did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. \n\nFor my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. \n\nAfter 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. \n\nWhen I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate \"when I felt hungry\" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. \n\nIn June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. \n\nIn July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. \n\nThis has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. \n\nI hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades. \n\nDose | Duration | A1C | BMI | Start Weight | End Weight | lbs lost | Total Lost | Lost/wk\n----|--------|---|---|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------\n0 | 5 weeks | 10.2 | 40.62 | 325 | 318 | 7 | 7 | 1.3 lb/wk\n2.5 | 4 weeks | --- | 39.74 | 318 | 300 | 18 | 25 | 3.0 lb/wk\n5.0 | 4 weeks | --- | 37.49 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 45 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 4 weeks | 6.2 | 34.62 | 280 | 277 | 3 | 48 | 2.8 lb/wk\n7.5 | 12 weeks | 5.4 | 32.24 | 277 | 258 | 19 | 67 | 2.28\n10 | 16 weeks | --- | 28.12 | 258 | 225 | 33 | 100 | 2.21",

You have to say “Dad, these are numbers that will likely cause you to lose your sight and possibly a foot if you don’t go to the doctor. I can’t help you if you won’t help yourself.”\n\nI’m being deliberate in mentioning blindness and loss of limbs. Many diabetics in denial will have a mentality of “so what, I’ll die on my terms” (black and white thinking). Reminding them that it’s not a straight line but they actually are likely to live, blind and without feet, can sometimes shake the denial. (The logic: once someone is treated for blindness/foot issues, they are finally treated for diabetes.)\n\nAnd even then, he might still choose to sail the River Denial. You have to let him.

Testing can also help keep you accountable.

If you eat pasta, for example, try to keep it to 1/4 of your plate. Fill another quarter with protein, such as baked fish. Fill half the plate with vegetables. Don’t go back for seconds, or if you do, make it just a taste/spoonful. Take a 10 minute walk right after your meal. When you get dessert, try to confine it to about three bites worth.

    "selftext": "Hi,  \n  \nJust want to share some personal experiences in this T2 diabetes journey.\n\nI am 58 yrs old male. Got diagnosed T2 with HBA1C 7.4% 2 years ago. Through controlled diets, exercises (walk, yoga, mediation), rest and self stress management and without any medication from beginning until now, my A1C gradually dropped to 6.8% then 6.1% then 5.4% and currently 5.2% and stays steady for the past 10 months. But, it's not about the numbers, it's about the whole system reaching the level of healing, adapting and self regulating.\n\nOne of the keys I have found throughout my journey is that **our body has wonderful capabilities to recover and to heal if we give it time and right conditions**. We might have unknowingly overworked or even abused our body over a long period and then we forcefully and frantically try to reverse the course in such stressful way.\n\nI’ve learnt that we need to listen to our body’s response little by little and patiently help it correcting and healing. It needs time to learn and to create new and good memories.\n\nI know that medication might be helpful to stop the damages but medication is unlikely to heal or to help our body to recover, specifically with T2 and especially if we maintain the habit of destroying our body. The process of healing and recovering require the complete reprogramming of our internal system to find harmony, balance and rhythm again, which might take a long time. The more rush, the more stress, the more harm done as the body is not a computer you can reset instantly. It is a *biological memory system* that needs time.\n\nTo heal and to recover, we need:\n\n* rhythm\n* rest\n* movement\n* nourishment\n* sunlight\n* calmness\n* consistency\n\nAnd avoid:\n\n* panic\n* over-diet\n* over-fasted\n* over-exercised\n* over-restricted\n* punished ourselves\n* got frustrated\n* tried to “fix everything in 3 weeks”\n\nAnd memory takes time:\n\n* to rewrite\n* to stabilise\n* to trust new patterns\n* to unlearn old stress responses\n\nThe body heals in ***slow waves***, **not violent jumps**.  \n\n\nI know we have different life styles, circumstances, environments but we all are having the same things: we have time to eat, to rest, to walk, to exercise, even very little. In our modern life these days, our lives are too fast, we are too stressed, we are eating too much ultra processed foods, we are moving our bodies too little, we are staying inside too much, we are sitting down too long. Fortunately, **we can all change these little by little**.\n\n**Recovery should be sustainable and enjoyable**. It should not be a burden or something we are so stressed over (such as we still want to eat that much cake, drink that much soda etc). If we relying on medication so that we can still harm our body then it will reach the inevitable consequence sooner. Instead, we can save medication for the later years when our body is old and run down, our muscles are no longer enough to absorb glucose, our pancreas is blunt and our insulin is so bad. In the meantime, we can always help our system to reprogram and to heal.\n\nCheers,",

Native Americans, for example, have genetic predispositions for low beta cell function, no matter how well they “rest and recover”. Understanding the epidemiology of a cellular-level predisposition to insulin resistance is much more than just saying “you’re not calm enough and you need more sunlight”. To equate “relying on medication” with harming your body is absolutely sending the wrong message to people. My endocrinologist informed me that for many people with diabetes, medication is a critical and non-negotiable part of their treatment plan, regardless of how meticulously they manage their diet and exercise. A healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise) is an important foundation of treatment, but it is often insufficient over time due to the progressive nature of the disease. Medication can become necessary to maintain safe blood sugar levels, prevent long-term complications affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, and supplement the body's diminishing ability to produce or use insulin effectively, regardless of how stressed we are. You talk about only needing it when your body is “old and run down”, but your experience at your age isn’t going to be everyone else’s.",

I immediately went on metformin 2x a day and glipizide 1 a day. Also immediately changed my diet. No carbs or sugar. I had a meeting with a diabetic educator a few days ago and she was very happy with my progress. My average numbers the past week have been between 105-125. When I get below 90 I experience symptoms of \"lows\" (shaking, vision blur, dizzy, sweating). I eat candy or something and feel ok shortly after. Doc said it was normal for me right now. She told me to stop taking the glipizide and so now im only doing metformin 1000 mg total a day. She said eventually I can decide if I want to stay on that or change to mounjaro, that it is up to me. \nI have no idea?? Food is stressing me out so much. Im eating great. But the constant food noise in my mind is burning me out already. Im vegetarian and recycling the same handful of meals throughout the week.. they are delicious but I still crave things I can't have. Desperately.\nFinger pricking is also getting so old lol. She gave me a free 10 day dexcom g7, and it has been informative to see how levels rise and fall. But the device has been wrong by about 20 points each time I double check with a finger prick test...\nAnyways. Sorry for rambling, ultimately im curious if you prefer metformin or Mounjaro? Or have any advice for me on deciding?\nThank you in advance &lt;3",

If I lose even 10lbs, I will be underweight according to BMI calculation.  I know not everyone lose weight on GLP-1 but since my current medication, lifestyle and diet is keeping my numbers at a good level, I am not going to mess with what is working.

This would lead to a long run of bad eating habits and even worse numbers.\n\nIt isn't a magic bullet, but wearing a CGM suddenly made everything clear to me.  What was confusing and mysterious to me before was now simple and obvious.  Something about seeing that visual representation just made everything click.  It also helped me identify foods that I thought were safe for me that actually weren't, and others that I was avoiding that are actually fine.\n\nMy diabetes is now very well managed (last three A1C's were 5.4, 5.2 and 5.3).  Knowing that it is so well managed helps me mentally handle when I have a setback or make a mistake and eat something that spikes me more than expected.  It doesn't feel like the end of the world, because I know I can get right back on track.\n\nIf you haven't been prescribed one, I would recommend asking your doctor about trying one.

My diabetes diagnosis was in March of this year and i was at a 6.6 but my symptoms started in the summer. When I started experiencing these symptoms I thought it was because my A1C was still high but I've had two subsequent tests done and have been at a 5.8 and a 5.6. From the middle of summer up to this day ive been peeing 10 to 15 times a day and drinking a ton of liquids. The sensation to pee creeps up on me after around 45 minutes and most of the time I pee a decent amount but sometimes its only a little.\n\nIve been trying to figure out what is causing this but im not sure. I have an appointment tomorrow and hope I can get some answers but feel like it might not happen. Ive looked online and saw a few potential causes of this issue.\n\n1. Hyperinsulinemia: where the body creates too much insulin and cant use it since we are insulin resistant. Frequent thirst and urination are symptoms.\n\n2. Diabetic prostate: where diabetes damages the prostate and can lead to frequent urination and UTIs, among other things.\n\n3. Neuropathy of the Bladder: where neuropathy damages the bladder leading to excessive urination and always feeling like you didnt empty out your bladder after you pee.\n\n4. Medication: I take Fluvoxamine 200mg daily and one effect is dry mouth, so maybe that's what's making me extra thirsty. I doubt this is the issue as I didnt have dry mouth before my diabetes started while on this medication.\n\nIt's one thing to just experience these bothersome symptoms by themselves but unfortunately, they can cause damage down the road. Im worried about these persistent symptoms damaging my kidneys. The frequent dehydration can eventually lead to kidney disease and i really dont want that. I had a creatinine test done a few weeks back and I believe they were at a 1.04 when they should be below a 1.02. Creatinine can indicate how well your kidneys function.\n\nI dont know why I am feeling this way, ive tested my blood glucose a handful of times the last week and a half and they are in the normal range. I hope it isnt anything bad. Im only 29 and im worried these symptoms will stay with me forever. Are you guys familiar with any issues of the Bladder/Prostate or hyperinsulinemia and have you had kidney disease from diabetes?\n\nThanks ",

Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia. \nIn October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.",

Specific use case at this time would be \"grains\", but later also would be other starches like potatoes, etc..\n\nI am currently of the belief that I need (want?) to know \"Total carbs\", \"fiber\", \"sugar alcohols\", \"sugars\", \"glycemic index\", etc.. I am understanding that I can calculate \"net carbs\", which from what I can tell thus far is the most significant parameter.\n\nThis started with my having stumbled across (online) recommendations to eat hulled barley rather than rice\\*\\*\\*. This source made a clear distinction between \"pearled barley\" and \"hulled barley\". This source made it appear the difference to be vast (between barley and rice as well as pearled and hulled barley). So I started substituting hulled barley for white rice. My wife asked my why I was doing that. So we went online (our phones at the dinner table) and started looking at numbers. Our initial hits indicated hulled barley to be WAY higher than white rice in carbohydrates, which puzzled me and caused me to dig slightly deeper at the time to find that, apparently, the numbers were for RAW rice and barley. And on and on and on it went to the point of me deciding I needed to create a spreadsheet to keep track and then be able to easily reference.\n\n\\*\\*\\*(OK, it was \"FED\" to me by the \"barley industry\", no doubt)\n\nFAIL FAIL FAIL\n\nProblem is that I can't find any SINGLE source for all of this information and when I start looking at a variety of sources offering only a portion of the relevant parameters I find that those parameters contained in both sources are significantly different. Therefore I don't know which of them to accept. Further compounding it is that some sources show the values for \"raw\", while not making it apparent, and other sources are showing for \"cooked\", while not making it apparent. There is a large difference between \"raw\" and \"cooked\" when it comes to grains. Who eats raw rice, anyway?\n\nHave any of you out there found a single source that lists all these parameters and has them in \"raw\" for AND \"cooked\"?\n\nFor grains, \"cooked\" is probably the only relevant form I would be eating. But other foods, like vegetables it would make total sense to eat raw and cooked so the values for raw and cooked would be relevant.\n\nUPDATE: I found a site that at least has some potential, others might be interested. [https://glycemicindex.com/](https://glycemicindex.com/)\n\nThis is a site run by the University of Sydney. They have a database that has what looks to be a comprehensive listing of various food-stuffs with their Glycemic Index and Glycemic Loads. I've noticed a problem with it, though, which I'm trying to work through now.\n\nI'm thinking that if I can get \"Glycemic Load\" for ingredients and don't need to stress over the actual carbs and sugars and fibers. My understanding is that \"Glycemic Load\" takes all of that into account and comes up with a number representing the overall impact on the amount of carbohydrates your body has to battle and how quickly.  A low GL (Glycemic Load\" indicates the foodstuff is one or the other or a combination of low carbs, low sugar, high fiber, etc.,. The higher the fiber is the lower/slower the sugars are released (something along those lines) or simply lower carbs means lower sugars to be dealt with, etc..",

The typical 3 to 8 AM window only applies when the liver still responds reasonably well to insulin. When the liver is insulin resistant, the glucose output doesn’t shut off after you wake up, so the elevated numbers can run much longer, even up to late morning.\n\nA few things can extend it to 10 or 11 AM:\n\n1. Cortisol rhythm: Your cortisol peaks around waking but stays elevated for hours afterward. If the liver is insulin resistant, it keeps releasing glucose the whole time.\n2. Hepatic IR: If the liver isn’t responding to insulin, taking meds earlier or going lower carb won’t fix the morning drift. The liver just keeps dumping glucose longer than it should.\n3. Low carb breakfast: Eggs and coffee won’t spike you, but they also don’t give any insulin signal to suppress liver glucose output. If hepatic IR is present, the liver needs at least a small insulin response to shut off the flood.\n4. Counterregulatory hormones: Growth hormone, adrenaline, and cortisol overlap for longer in some people, especially under stress or sleep disruption.\n\nA quick test:  \nTry adding a small amount of low glycemic carbs with some protein, like half a cup of steel cut oats or a slice of whole grain bread with your eggs. If your numbers drop faster afterward, that means your liver needed an insulin signal to shut off production.\n\nYou’re not alone. In people with hepatic insulin resistance, dawn phenomenon stretching until 10 to 11 AM is actually pretty common.",

Many of us indulged in poor eating habits, but there IS a genetic component, even for type 2.  If it helps for the long term coping, many folks here who have been diabetic decades report aging with better health BECAUSE diabetes forces them to embrace good habits:  eating well, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, managing stress.  The people successful long term are people who take it seriously and do \"all the things\" to improve their health.\n\nIt is definitely overwhelming initially.\n\nIf you're not ready to tell family, don't.  Enjoy your birthday and do some quiet things to minimize impact on your blood sugar.  Like, if cooking at home or going out, maybe opt for a steak or chicken and have a big salad.  Skip the potato and then have cake.  And try to go for a walk afterward.  Most of us indulge a bit for special events...it's more a matter of being good MOST OF THE TIME and not turning an \"indulgence\" into a bacchanalian extravaganza (like 3 helpings of mashed potatoes and stuffing and then multiple pieces of pie).  You could maybe tell a half white lie for your birthday and say you have been feeling better eating keto, but you will splurge on a piece of cake.\n\nI only told two people about my initial diagnosis.  Other family members had enough on their plates and I didn't want to worry them so I didn't tell others for 6 months.  And by then I'd had two more doctor's visits, made major changes, and had my a1c down to 6 (lower now).\n\nYou can do this.  There will likely be a lot of food posts headed into Thanksgiving and that will give you a feel for how people balance things for special events.  Take it a step at a time for now...take prescribed meds, add in exercise, reduce your carbs.  If your doctor hasn't set you up with a nutritionist, ask for that appointment.\n\nEDIT:  Just wanted to add this:  I went through my pantry soon after diagnosis.  Food banks are in desperate need right now so if you are motivated to get rid of unopened bags, boxes, and cans of things like rice, pasta and other carby things, you can remove the temptations from your home and help someone else at the same time.",

That all takes a bit of time.\n\nBe kind and go easy on yourself as much as you can. Get some extra r&amp;r. This isn’t your fault. I’m sure you can think of 15 people your age who have similar lifestyles but don’t have diabetes. The genetic component is huge.\n\nThe things that helped me most at the beginning:\n\nThe book The Diabetes Code by Jason Fung helped me learn about how diabetes worsens and improves in the body. He also goes into low/lower carb eating and intermittent fasting (IF). Just know that super low carb eating and IF aren’t appropriate or right for everyone, though they do help many. There are lots of different eating plans. In time you’ll find something that works well for you. Also, I don’t involve myself in the controversy over terms like remission, good control, etc. The goal is improved health and wellbeing.\n\nAlso, my sessions with my diabetes educators were invaluable. 1-hour sessions with someone who’s kind and knowledgeable to help me figure out my initial plan and to pepper with my 100s of questions. My insurance covered these 100%.\n\nThis sub was really helpful too.

I still want to get down to 160lbs (I’m at about 173lbs)  and would love to reach an A1C around 5.3. I get way more food cravings now than I did last year and because of work and being a parent I don’t get to excercise as much as I use to when I started getting serious about taking care of myself starting diabetes.\n\nMy endocrinologist said I could just try doubling my dosage, but also stressed this was the highest dosage. At the moment, I also take Jardiance daily, 1000mg of Metformin, a statin and Linsilpro. \n\nI turn 46 next mint and I just want to live a real long life because I’m dad with a young kid. ",

I was referred to my local diabetes in pregnancy clinic and started on insulin and metformin within two days. The first 8 weeks after diagnosis were really hard. My blood sugar was wildly out of control. I was trying to find the dose of insulin that worked. I was walking on the treadmill three times a day to minimize spikes. But I was in a good range after 8 weeks, and maintenance was easier than getting there. My a1c was 5.0 at 4 months in and I maintained that until the end of my pregnancy. I had 13 ultrasounds. They did an early anatomy scan to look for birth defects caused by high blood sugar, but that was clear. I had regular growth scans starting at 28 weeks, and I don't even know how many NSTs I had. My baby was perfectly fine though. My OB said she showed no signs of being affected by it at all. She was 6lbs9oz at birth, born at 37+4 weeks gestation, and she had no hypoglycemia, no jaundice, and I healed beautifully from my c section. I think the main thing was that the mental load was really high. Especially at the end of the pregnancy, I was dealing with lows, so calculating the right amounts of insulin to keep my after meal numbers in range and my fasting in range without sending me too low was a lot of work.",

I saw my endo once a month, talked to my diabetes team (nurses and dieticians) every 2 weeks, and saw my OB every week by the end. In my third trimester, I did a no-stress test at the hospital every week and had ultrasounds for baby’a size every 2 weeks. I also had a couple extra ultrasounds for baby’s heart at a cardiologist since that is standard for diabetes women where I am.\n\nManaging my sugars was really really hard because I would spike unexpectedly, my sugars would peak like 3-4 hours after a meal instead of the expected 2 hours, and exercise was hard because I was sooo tired from the pregnancy. It’s all the placenta they throws things out of whack. I would eat the same thing every day for breakfast and some days I would go high, some days I would be perfectly in range…..it felt like such a crapshoot.\n\nThat being said my A1c when I started pregnancy was 6.9, and it was down to 5.5 in my third trimester. I was induced ar 38 weeks (standard for diabetics) and my baby was 7.5 lbs. there is a big risk if your sugars are high, your baby will have low blood sugar, so baby’s blood sugar is tested 4 times in the first 24 hours of their life. Baby was perfect in my case.\n\nAs hard as it all was, especially all the monitoring and appointments - I of course would say it was worth it. We are happy and healthy now and I am forgetting day by day how hard it was and am contemplating a second baby.\n\nYou can likely find more on the sub bumperswhobolus but it does also include T1. \n\nGood luck!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been reading up on **Dr. Jason Fung’s work** around fasting and Type 2 diabetes, and I’m honestly intrigued. I’m currently **210 lbs**, diagnosed with **Type 2 diabetes**, and trying to lose weight while keeping my sugars in check.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, fasting (whether intermittent fasting or longer windows like 16:8 / 18:6) can help **lower insulin resistance**, **reduce blood sugar**, and even push some people toward **remission**. But what I’m trying to understand is the *long game* —\n\n* **Does fasting work long term?** Like, do people really maintain lower A1C and weight years later, or does it plateau or rebound once you stop fasting?\n* **What are the effects of fasting over many years?** Does metabolism slow down, or does the body adapt well if you stick with a sustainable routine (say 16:8 most days)?\n* **If you’ve done this yourself**, how did your fasting schedule evolve over time? Did you combine it with low-carb or keto, or just calorie restriction?\n\nI’m hoping to hear from people who’ve tried fasting for 6+ months or even years — especially **those managing diabetes without medication** or reducing their meds along the way.\n\nAny lessons learned, pitfalls, or advice for someone starting this journey?\n\nThanks in advance 🙏  \n*(Planning to start slow, maybe a 14:10 or 16:8 schedule and gradually build from there.)*",

My doctor said I need insulin but I refused. I weighed 225 lbs. I’m 5ft tall\n\nI started slow, a week or so of 18:6 which I found surprisingly easy. Then I moved to  OMAD. After about a month I pressed myself even more. I did a two day fast one week, three days the next, four and a half day fast the next! The results were amazing. I was quite proud of my accomplishment. Wow four days without eating holy crap!\n\nMy GP doc was zero help through the process. I was on tons of meds for diabetes high blood pressure rheumatoid arthritis cholesterol etc. when I said I was keto he was horrified. Said just keep taking meds and try to exercise a bit. Forget about mentioning fasting he would drop dead. My rheumatologist was a bit better as he was Muslim and supported me with OMaD\n\nI tested my blood continuously always worried I’d keel over with a hypo. Never happened. At first my BG would come down but still be elevated. I stuck with it and sure enough it went lower and lower while fasting. Just as Fung promised. \n\nThen I started to do some longer fasts but by this time I bought a ketone monitor. I was getting BG readings of 3.8/3.9 during my fasts but felt fantastic!!! My ketones were high, I was totally running off my body fat!\n\nMy meds became problematic as I was healing. As mentioned I could not talk to\nMy doc about this zero support. I noticed I was getting dizzy when I stood up. Dr Google told me to check Blood pressure. I went to the drug store daily for a while to check. Yep low. I stopped my BP med and felt great\n\nI basically weaned myself off all\nMy meds by myself as I healed…reverse order from\nWhen prescribed. \n\nI went for a physical and assorted blood. In 4 months I lowered a1c to 4.6. Normal Cholesterol, great triglycerides, normal bp, normal EKG. Normal everything. I still had RA of course but even my CRP was much lower\n\nWhen I told my doc I hadnt taken my meds for two months his\nMouth dropped open\n\nI even went for a bone scan and\nFound out my bone density improved greatly since Last check up. My acid reflux was gone too\n\nEventually I got sick of fasting. Can’t explain it. Just stopped. Lost my mojo. Lost 60 pounds. I stayed keto for a long while. Then morphed to low carb. Then carb creep. Back to high carb. Here comes diabetes again once you are at that point. \n\nSo ya. Back to keto/low carb. These days not doing huge fasting just some\nIF and skipping meals. \n\nAs soon as you change your diet back to the way it was, all your problems rapidly return \n\nBTW still overweight but the 60lbs I lost during fasting is still off.

I'm not off all the meds but I probably could  be. Mounjaro is such a good drug and my insurance pays for it so why come off?\n\nAnyway, yes. You can keep the fat off once you stop seriously fasting but you do still have to keep most of the lifestyle changes. It's important to strength train and maintain/grow muscle mass. \n\nI also find it way harder to fast now. When I was obese it was relatively easy, now I get light headed. No idea why.

If you are able to lose weight, do intermittent fasting, add muscles and control your carb intake (or some combination of these), many people do show improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation.  In some cases, you can reduce your medication or, less frequently, eliminate your medicines altogether. However, it is still just remission, i.e. you need to maintain that state actively. If you go back to your old life style or add back the weight, your insulin resistance will come back. On the flip side, most of these things have many benefits even outside of diabetes. And even if it is temporary, it will be beneficial.\n\nIf you are going to do it, you have do it carefully because between not eating too many carbs in each meal and having a limited amount of time to eat, intermittent fasting almost always leads to significant caloric deficit. You have to up your protein intake and put in some weight training to ensure that the weight loss does not come from muscle loss. Ideally work with a dietician. There is a lot of woo on the internet so you could end up overdoing it and being miserable with minimal benefit.",

I started with IF, stretched to 24 hour, then 36 hour and now targeting 48 hour fasts once a week. Other benefits I hadn't anticipated: lower food bill, more time (not spent shopping, cooking, cleaning). I can't say I love fasting, but it's kinda like exercise--you get used to it and the benefits far outweigh the effort.\n\nHonestly, it was this podcast about Rapamycin (a cancer and anti-aging drug with many of same impacts as fasting) that made me curious and sent me down the rabbit hole to recognize the overall health benefits of fasting. [https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub](https://radiolab.org/podcast/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub)\n\nHeres the AI take on autophagy.  (Note that I  researched peer-reviewed credible sources on my trip down the rabbit hole, and I encourage anyone interested to do the same): \n\nFasting triggers autophagy, a cellular \"clean-up\" process where the body removes and recycles damaged components. This cellular renewal is activated by nutrient and energy deprivation, which suppresses pathways like mTOR, allowing autophagy to begin. Short-term fasts (16-24 hours) and longer fasts (24-48 hours or more) can both induce autophagy, though prolonged periods may also engage different mechanisms.  \n\nHow fasting activates autophagy\n\n* **Nutrient deprivation:** When you fast, your cells experience a lack of nutrients and energy. \n* **Signaling pathways:** This lack of nutrients triggers a cellular response that activates enzymes like AMPK and inhibits the mTOR pathway, which are key regulators that \"put the brakes\" on autophagy. \n* **Initiating the process:** With the brakes off, autophagy can begin. This involves the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membraned structures that engulf and transport cellular waste to the lysosomes for breakdown and recycling. \n\nEffects and benefits of autophagy during fasting\n\n* **Cellular cleanup:**  Autophagy removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, helping to maintain cellular health and function. \n* **Cellular efficiency:**  It can lead to a more efficient cell by removing unnecessary components. \n* **Potential disease prevention:**  Studies suggest a link between autophagy and the prevention of diseases associated with cellular waste, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. \n* **Fat burning:**  Autophagy, specifically a process called lipophagy, can aid in burning fat by removing potentially toxic lipids. \n* **Energy production:**  A byproduct of autophagy, alanine, can be sent to the liver to help create glucose through gluconeogenesis. ",

        "body": "It works. Short and long term. IN COMBINATION with a low carb and/or ketogenic diet. It worked for me and has done for many many people- long term.\n\nI think of it in 2 stages: \n1. Correction \n2. Maintenance.\n\nFor correction consider going keto first, then adding IF after about a month. Reason is that bringing carbs down to that level (20-30g per day) helps your body metabolism to switch from burning primarily glucose for fuel to primarily burning fats for fuel. In addition to that wonderful shift, your hunger hormones start getting back in balance and no longer drive cravings and feelings of deep hunger. Fasting at that point becomes easy. Varying the length is super helpful too. Pick a minimum daily # of hours like 12, and then do some days 17, some 19 etc. Then add a couple longer ones a month…24, 36, 48.\n\nIt will work. Takes between 6-12 months.\n\nOnce you’ve got your a1c, lipid panel, other labs, and weight where you want them, start slowly and carefully adding some carbs back…try 40g for a week. Make sure you’ve not gained any weight back or seen more spikes.  Then try 50g for a week.. check spikes, weight and notice if your cravings have shown back up etc… keep your fasting schedule to at least your minimum.\nPay attention to how you’re feeling and spikes and weight. They will tell you if you’ve added too much back. \n\nLots of people have done this for decades. \nCheck out Beat Diabetes channel on yt. Lots of people talking about doing this long term.",

Her response simply was “we don’t know enough about diabetes to say a certainty. Being predisposed via genes, hormone imbalance, and a lifestyle impact. There could be 10 women, in this room who lived as you lived and look the same as you, but with different genetics would not get diabetes.” But I know when people hear type2 they assume I am an egregious consumer of food and sugar..\n\nEver since my diagnosis I’ve been so ashamed. Since then I’ve done everything right, lost weight (70lbs), brought my A1C down from a 10 to a 5.7, I’ve even carried a healthy baby and continue to lose weight with a managed A1C post pregnancy. \n\nI wish there was a place that I fit into where I don’t feel ashamed or out of place.

If it's a private office, and they do an A1C, glucose, and whatnot, $200 is more than fair in most areas of the country. If you're living in Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, LA, NYC, you could consider like $250. If it's hospital based, file for charity care so they can possibly lower your bill. \n\nAsk for a 3 month supply of CGM sensors. \n\nDepending on how high your A1C is, they may want insulin anyway, which is sometimes a requirement for the CGMs. If nothing else, get a glucometer, lancets (33g my pref) and check as directed. \n\nIf you start insulin, you're going to probably need to check in with them weekly for a bit to titrate to get to a more manageable level. Idk how much metformin you're on or A1C but know that it is a possibility. That shouldn't cost too much in terms of fees if at all.

If you try to do too much at once, it won’t be successful. She will need to permanently change her diet and lifestyle, adding in more movement to help regulate blood sugar. Many of the more dire outcomes of diabetes can be prevented by taking these changes seriously now, as damage occurs over the long term.\n\nLook into keto diet, although you do not want to completely eliminate carbs, just reduce them. It is kind of helpful in a way that she wants to eat the same things all the time. That makes counting carbs easier for most meals. However, the carb content of those meals may need to change from what she is eating now. Generally, half her plate should be non starchy vegetables, a quarter should be protein, and a quarter should be starch. You still have to watch servings sizes: maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown rice, or a half of a small sweet potato. If she will eat nuts, that is a good snack as long as she doesn’t eat too many.\n\nI would put all her meds in an online “drug interaction” site to see if any of these meds interact poorly with each other. I’d see if I could speak to a pharmacist/chemist too. Metformin is well known for causing gastric distress (diarrhea), especially at first, so it’s odd she has reduced bowel movements.",

I’m not saying she needs to get off of it but the Amlodipine and Bisoprolol both cause extreme fatigue, brain fog. And the statin she’s taking is causing the pain. Generally, whenever any statin is prescribed, the doctor usually puts them on CoQ10 because it depletes the CoQ10 in the body which causes muscle aches, etc..\n\nYour question was about why she was laying in bed and feeling tired, this has nothing to do with her carb intake. Please do not stop what you’re doing because that is good. However, you might benefit from getting a second opinion from a different doctor.

So it might simply be possible that you need a stronger form of the drug.\n\nThe other downside is that rybelsus feedback is that its a real pain to take. restrictions around fasting with it etc.. \n\nthe other downsides are the same side effects possible with ozempic.\n\n\"but, yeah, no\" doesn't really describe why you're concerned about ozempic. It's a great drug. If its the needle thing it shouldn't be an issue - it's a nothingburger. It's way less of a deal than a finger stick.. tiny needle, just goes under the skin - it's nothing like a vaccination or veinous blood draw. braindead simple to do. not a big deal.",

Years later, I was put on Mounjaro and it’s been fantastic. I think any of these options are worth a shot because GLP-1s have been life changing for me.

It's all low carb enough not to spike me and it takes a minute to have a PB&amp;J and be satisfied and done.\n\nAtkins brand TV dinners aren't the best ever but their pizzas will make you feel like you cheated without spiking you. And the TV dinners tend to work okay for a meal when you don't want to cook.\n\nIf you want to order out, wingstop is really easy to eat at with diabetes. Taco bell has some bowls that are fun. If you buy some low cab tortillas to keep at home, you could throw the contents of the bowls into them a make a low carb junk food buritto at home.\n\nYeah, none of these ideas will help you lose weight or \"get healthy\" but they'll fit within a diet meant to keep your A1C in a range that doesn't destroy your internal organs.\n\nIf you want to be \"healthy\" and not cook, you could always get a rotisserie chicken and a ceasar salad kit. A few croutons will fit into your carb limit and will make you feel like a human while you're still getting fiber from salad and some healthy protein from chicken.\n\nNot every meal has to be home-cooked. You can even find fun foods. Low A1C is more important than fiber and healthy right now. Get that A1C down and then focus on the greens and nutrients. It'll be easier to focus on the healthy foods when you aren't in high blood sugar land.",

        "body": "One thing that has really helped me lower my numbers is just giving up rice completely, I never liked brown rice but eating white rice was always a staple in my diet.  I've given up rice for what's been almost a year now and don't miss it, I'll have some if I'm craving it but seldom do. \n\nHere is my reasoning for giving up rice,  a bowl of rice is like 40-50 carbs?  a bowl of brown rice is like 35-45 carbs?  Roughly, I don't recall exactly what they are.  So would I rather eat those empty carbs or could I just eat a piece of fried chicken instead.  For instance, a breast at popeyes fried chicken is about 16 carbs compared to like 30 plus carbs for a filler rice .  I just go through this game with myself, would I rather eat this or have some rice.  \n\nWhat I've also done is just have a rotation of vegetables around and allow myself to not count calories on them and just eat until I'm as full as I want to be.  I can either eat them like a salad or just saute them for a few minutes and use salt, pepper, butter, and chicken bouillon on them for simplicity or do a more traditional asian stir fry with them.  The veggies I go for is broccoli, zucchini or green squash, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, bok choy, various kinds of spinach and just whatever is different if I'm getting bored.  \n\nAlso if you are tired of having crackers as snacks, it goes back to doing some trade offs.  Can I cut this from my meal and sub it for something else so then I can have a more savory snack that might have some carbs in it.  \n\nLastly, something else that has helped me control my A1C1 is just making sure I take a walk after my meals, I aim for 15 minutes and generally try to have 10k steps by the end of the day.",

I asked if he’d seen a doctor. He used to drink 4 liters of Coke a day, plus a liter of fruit juice, greasy foods, white bread — his diet was terrible.\n\n\n\n# Then he started urinating 4 times a night, foamy urine, mouth dry like sandpaper. I told him, “Let’s go to the doc.” His fasting glucose came back 13.1, so the doctor ordered full labs. My brother immediately went cold turkey — quit all the junk, started drinking only water and lime. His urine cleared up, the foam went away, the thirst stopped. But the damage was done.\n\n\n\n# Lab results:\n\n\n\n# HbA1c: 14.1\n\n\n\n# ALT: 69\n\n\n\n# Cholesterol: 5.8\n\n\n\n# Doc put him on Metformin 500mg twice a day, a blood pressure pill, baby aspirin, and statins (20mg). After 4 days on that combo, my brother was exhausted — barely talking, no appetite, legs cramping, no energy. We saw another doctor who said to stop the statin — 20mg was too strong for a body already drained from rapid weight loss and no carbs. He also said the blood pressure meds were unnecessary since my bro doesn’t even have high blood pressure — it was just drying him out and depleting electrolytes.\n\n\n\n# A day after stopping those meds, he perked up again — started eating and feeling alive.\n\n\n\n# Now, here’s the problem: he’s still losing weight, even though he’s eating healthy. Doc said to cut the low GI brown bread, but I can’t — if I do, he’ll waste away. He’s hungry all the time. His glucose is still up — fasting around 13, 11, 10, and after meals 8.2 or 9. Doc says insulin could drop him too low because his post-meal readings aren’t that bad, but I’m scared we’re just watching him fade slowly.\n\n\n\n# Please, if you’ve gone through this — or helped someone get their strength back — I need some hope or guidance. I just want him to gain healthy weight again and get his energy back.\n\n\n\n# Thank you.",

However, in the last month, I was informed that the OneTouch was no longer supported by my insurance (I called my insurance and they said that the Ultra2 was old tech so they no longer covered it) Okay, sure, fine.\n\nThey shift me over to the Accu-Check Guide Me.  I still have plenty of stuff left to use for the OneTouch, So I'm going to use that up before I dig into the accucheck.\n\nBut I did go ahead and try it so I could see how it worked, and on one blood draw I got vastly different numbers. Enough so it makes me go 'should...should I call my doc about this?'\n\nYesterday evening's numbers:\n\nOne Touch Ultra2 - 137\n\nAccu-check - 97  \n\n\nThis morning's draw numbers:\n\n  \nOneTouch Ultra2 -122\n\nAccu-Check Guide Me - 107\n\n  \nHow could they be \\*that\\* different?

        "body": "The Accu-Chek Guide and Guide Me are the better meters compared to models based on older tech.  If you want to compare them try testing the same (big) drop of blood with both meters.  You'll find one tends to read higher than the other. This is true of almost all meters on the market that use different test strips.  A meter or batch of test strips can be faulty and give a similar result but even when working perfectly there's always a 'relative bias' in the readings between different meters.\n\nThe basic standard for meters (basically) says that they should be within 15% of true objective accuracy at least 95% of the time.  That's plus or minus 15%, so two meters can give readings from the same drop of blood that are consistently nearly 30% apart, on average, and both still meet the basic standards.\n\nIn the most recent independent study I know of the Contour Next One came out on top for accuracy, followed by the Accu-Chek Guide and OneTouch Verio Reflect.  These meters are based on the most recent tech and the manufacturers have invested in producing the most accurate meters possible (and charge a premium price for the test strips).\n\nI own all three of these models along with eight others as I was interested in finding the best affordable meter(s) for calibrating CGMs with.  The difference between the Contour Next One and some of the cheaper meters I own which use older technology is stark.  When levels are stable such as before meals you can test over and over again with the Next and get very similar numbers.  Some of the cheaper models would produce readings which jump around all over the place, and only a few of them, the Accu-Chek Guide being one, would produce readings that were consistently close to the Next.  That said, the Guide almost always gives a reading that is a little higher than the Next.",

Pick whichever one is easier/cheaper to use and stick with it.  You’ll just drive yourself crazy otherwise.\n\nDon’t get too hung up on your exact glucose number unless it’s really high or low.

Once first thing, then again at various time depending on the day. This weekend was different because I was volunteering at a Con and was forced to eat \"con food\". If you know you know... \nI usually start the day around 120 and end the day around 90. Last night I took my sugar before dinner and was surprised to see a 67. I took it again to confirm and it gave me an 83. Should I tose it up to a bad strip, or have I just unlocked a new level of Diabetes? How many \"Lows\" should I wait for before talking to my Doctor?

    "selftext": "Hello all. I've started my weight loss journey a couple of weeks ago. I weighed 300 pounds then and also started Metformin 500mg daily to help my blood sugar even though my numbers are in range. I lost 10 pounds in a week but in that week I ate relatively healthy and walked a ton in Las Vegas (30+ miles in four days). Then last week I ate pretty darn good except for a couple meals and kept my calories and carbs low. I haven't weighed myself again since last week but I've had to have lost at least five more pounds. So in total I probably lost around 15 pounds in two weeks. Is this too much? I really want to lose weight to see if my diabetes can get better even though my numbers are in the normal range. Im super motivated to lose weight and want to lose it at a good pace and not too slow.\n\nI think ive had some side effects of losing this weight quickly. I think im more thirsty than usual. Can this weight loss lead to negative effects to my diabetes? Thank you for reading.",

        "body": "Nobody actually knows what a safe or healthy rate of weight loss is, so long as you're getting all the nutrients your body needs.  You'll see comments to the effect that around 1Kg per week, around 2 lbs, is a 'healthy' rate.  I read that online soon after I was diagnosed, but when I went looking for sources it turns out those numbers are basically made up, just something off the top of someone's head that stuck because there was no concrete research on the subject and so nothing to contradict it ('around 1 or 2 units of weight, or something, seems fine to me').  It's considered a safe rate but beyond that nobody really knows.\n\nLosing weight too fast may be unhealthy, but being obese definitely is unhealthy.  It may be worth taking a good vitamin supplement or two and using one of the better food tracking apps like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal to be sure you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need, including things like Omega 3 oils and so on. Also, don't cut down on protein intake if you want to retain as much muscle mass as possible as you lose weight.  Don't exercise so much that you risk injury.  Drink plenty of water.  Beyond that nobody can actually tell you what is and isn't safe.  Nobody has ever done the experiment of intentionally getting a group of obese people to lose weight very quickly and for an extended period of time while at the same time feeding them all the nutrients they need (apart from the calories).  Without that piece of research nobody can give you a straight answer beyond 'around a kilo a week is probably fine'.\n\nEdit - the closest thing to such an experiment that I know of is the Newcastle diet used for Prof Taylor's Counterpoint study, which was a rapid weight loss diet for the purpose of Type 2 diabetes research.  That was an 800 calorie per day diet and the most serious reported side effect was temporary hair loss beginning after eight weeks or so into the diet.  If you Google 'Newcastle Diet booklet' you'll find a link to a PDF file on the Newcastle University website and all the observed side effects are listed in that booklet.",

Of course my weight couldn't have been a problem: I had been obese all my life with no problems, right?\n\nBut things took a bad turn. The camel's back was breaking. I had to go to the doctor and the diagnosis explained pretty much everything, but I knew I could do something about it.\n\nMy suggestion is start with the basics: lifestyle.\n\n* **Learn:** First I devoured a book that really helped me understand the condition and come up with an action plan. I used every resource provided by my insurance, employer, and health provider system. Met with a dietician, a health coach, and a diabetic care nurse. They reviewed my plan, gave me a big thumbs-up, and I just passed my 1st year anniversary of diagnosis. Avoid quacks who promise results based on just anecdotes without science and research to back them.\n* **Sleep**: Strive to get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. For me that meant no more sleeping to videos or movies, but playing instrumental music (or nothing).\n* **Meals**: Eat right. Don't go for \"woo\" diets that would make your grandparents shake their heads. I follow the general admonition \"Eat whole foods, mostly plants, and not too much.\" I'm vegan so for me animal products aren't \"food\". I adopted a whole-food, plant based diet, use the \"portion plate\" and measure my portions carefully. I don't strictly count carbs or calories, but I am very mindful of them. No food is \"good\" or \"bad\", but I strive to compose meals with an overall low-to-medium glycemic load.\n* **Activity**: Get up. Get moving. When I started there were days I didn't walk even 200 steps, but now I strive for 8,000 steps a day (the \"10,000 Steps\" movement was a marketing campaign and not based on science). I got a bicycle and started riding for errands. In months I was riding at least 30 minutes a day. Moreover I budget at least 15 minutes of activity after each meal. Either a walk around the block or a bike ride. If I time things right and the weather is good I'll eat then take a 5-10 mile ride to the store and back. Or go to the gym. Those are the meals I know I can handle harder glycemic loads.\n\nWelcome to the club! The entry process sucks, but the knowledge I was able to get about myself, health, and nutrition will make it worthwhile!\n\n(P.S. I'm on Metformin, **1000mg / 2x day**... I win? 🤪)",

We have removed most carbs, breads and snacks. I print off a booklet I created every month.  Every meal is picked for the right fuels for his body and trying to enjoy what hes eating (as I cook every meal) and Im now baking super seeded, low carb bread, not that he has it often but it helps and Im even making our own icecream (ninja creami) and every meal begins with a salad, as Im from an italian family we always ate salads after our main. Im making my own salad dressings and using apple cidar vinegar.  Im even making him chips/crisps using baked egg white and seasoning for snacks so be creative.  We're trying a \"whole food\" approach and not premade/packaged with chemicals or boxed food that promise low carb. Picking the correct vegetables and fruits, increased some dairy like greek yoghurt.  Lots of fish.  We were also told to not do low fat as his body needs good fats. Throw out the cooking oil and start using a good olive oil.  His HBAC1 was 14 and last month was 5.6.  We know Christmas is coming up so hes hoping to enjoy and indulge a bit.\n\nUnfortunately hes been unable to exercise as much as he would like so he has swimming x 2 and pilates x 1 per week and just started light weight training to build back the muscle he lost.  Weight training days his numbers are higher because thats what the body does so something to keep in mind and dont go animal in the gym.\n\nMy husband has hated his diagnosis, he sees it as a personal failure so its been a battle for him and he still refuses to accept it.  Even yesterday he number was higher than he wanted to see and he was a hot mess, swinging between anger and tears BUT, as I told him, stress does not help and when he is upset hes only hurting his body so we went through the day befores food diary and talked about some of his choices and switched a few things around.  For example, I know if he has lamb for dinner his bedtime and next morning number is higher so we avoid lamb.  When he is stressed or upset, I see his numbers go up so please try to work on that as well.  Good luck!\n\nEdit.

        "body": "Hi. I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was just recently diagnosed myself, on December 31, 2024, so I have less than a year of experience in managing my condition. But, that puts me pretty close to having been where you were in the recent past. \n\nNow, really, only you know what kind of person you are, what kind of habits and proclivities you have. So, what works for someone else won't necessarily work for you, and that's not your fault, that's just misapplication of a conditional solution. One of which you do not meet. \n\nSo, December 31, 2024, an ER doctor asks me, \"And what medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?\" and I said, \"Treat my what, now?\" Then he told me, \"Oh, your blood glucose is over 330. You have diabetes. You'll need to discuss this with your primary care physician immediately.\" And, then, when I got home, I, in my typically very placid and even keeled response, threw away every carbohydrate in my house. Then I went to the grocery store and I bought split chicken breasts and salad &amp; vegetables and cottage cheese and eggs.\n\nI baked the chicken breasts, prepared the vegetables, boiled some eggs, and I was ready to go for the week. \n\nI did that for about five weeks. On February 7, I started taking Mounjaro. Over those 5 weeks I had managed to lose 7 lbs. I went from 325 to 318. That was good weight loss. More than a pound a week. But, I thought, if this stuff is supposed to make me feel sated easier, with less, and full longer, I might be able to fine tune my diet to science the fuck out of diabetes. \n\nBecause, here's another one of those \"everyone's unique\" issues. I'm a mathematician and an engineer. You can't show me a problem, tell me, \"This problem is too difficult for most people to solve.\" silently challenging my capabilities, and expect I'm not going to analyze this thing down to the planck. \nFirst thing I did, I made a spreadsheet. You might be thinking I made a decent spreadsheet. You're imagining 3-4 separate sheets maybe. I showed this to a coworker and she said, \"Oh, you just recreated MyFitnessPal in...a spreadsheet?\" and, when she said that, I thought, \"She thinks I shouldn't have used a spreadsheet. I should have used some other tool. What other tool would that be? Okay, we can't think about this right now, or the pause will get too awkward. What should we say to move the conversation on?\" I responded, \"Oh, well, I mean, I just wanted to hack it together in a couple hours.\", to which she said, \"You recreated MyFitnessPal in a spreadsheet...in an afternoon? Hahaha.\" \n\nIt's here that I realized I misunderstood her first question's motive, and that she didn't have an opinion on my use of a spreadsheet to implement the solution, but that I would bother to implement a solution at all, when MyFitnessPal already exists. Why waste all of that effort? \n\nSo I replied, \"I know I could have downloaded MyFitnessPal, but I don't trust corporations with my personal data, plus, I get to display the numbers in any fashion I find interesting at the moment, linear, logarithmic, geometric, derivatives, integrals. I can see all the things, and it was interesting. I like to stretch myself on these fun tasks, and making a spreadsheet this sophisticated was a fun distraction. I learned some new tricks.\"\n\nShe nods, and we go back to discussing the important topic at hand, the numbers in the spreadsheet. It's very existence is just an assumed precondition for this story to progress. \n\nWe finish eating, and we go back to our meeting area. Oh, I think that might be important. This was at lunch in a pretty nice restaurant. Expensive, at least. Where I pulled my 16\" laptop out of my backpack and regaled everyone with the intricate details of all of the metrics I am measuring and all of the projections I'm projecting, and the graphics. Passing the laptop around the table. \n\nBack in the meeting area. My coworker walks over to a group of our coworkers and says, \"Hey guys, you should ask Eeyore_ to show you his spreadsheet.\" And someone said, \"What spreadsheet?\" So we sat down to a brief 30 minute presentation and narrative of my diabetes management behaviors.\n\nEveryone had a great time.\n\nThen things started to get weird. Everything before now is 100% normal person activity. Close enough to be within a single standard deviation of \"normal\" distribution. Because now I started making rules for my diet game. Why did I start making ridiculous BASEketball style rules? \n\nBecause I created a fucking scoreboard in my spreadsheet, so of course I have to win the top score! And, the points were how much weight I could lose. How improved my blood glucose was, how improved my liver enzymes were. How improved is my blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, all-the-things.\n\nOkay, so, what are these rules? Some of them are just ridiculous. \n\n* If I felt hungry, I could eat unlimited vegetables, but I restricted myself to only 2 tbsp max of salad dressing per meal. \n\nThis is an easy one. We'll start evolving off of this basic rule as we progress. So, one week it would be \"This week, I can only eat unlimited amounts of carrots.\" Everything else would be measured out, weighed out on a gram scale, and portioned appropriately. \n\nAgain, being a good scientist, I knew I needed a control group, or rather, some control stats so that I would be able to track what that unmedicated trend was like. So I began recording everything that would become relevant from the very beginning. First thing I did, even before I threw every carbohydrate out of my house, was start a notebook to take notes on my blood pressure, emotional state, energy, medication, perceived stress, food intake, bathroom frequency. Normal person stuff. The normal people do this kind of thing. If they can be bothered to stop doing and spend a little bit of time thinking before acting. \n\nSo, I said things were going to get weird. Because I had restricted my diet to such a narrow band of options, I had to gamify every other aspect of the experience, because, if I'm not going to get dopamine from eating the same chicken on the same salad for the 12th time this week, then I need to get that fix from something else. Something with numbers, and a scoreboard. And, having read Atomic Habits (Ultra AI abridged version, but, I got the gist of it. I read a few of them on repeat a dozen times. Normal person stuff.) I knew that gamifying these small habits can lead to chaining them long term and sticking as good habits. Just like clicker training a dog. Except I was contra-Inception-ing myself.  Fully aware of how I would condition myself, knowing intricately the workings of this psyche. \n\nLet's look at a simple breakfast rule. What are you going to eat for breakfast? Same thing we eat every day, Pinky, 1/2 cup of cottage cheese.\n\nWell, Eeyore_, here's the thing, you know, you **know** that you will eventually wear yourself out of managing to eat a food item if you eat it every day. You'll grow to hate it. So, we have to have some variety. But, that variety needs to be a surprise. I can't just alternate between 1/2 cup of cottage cheese one day and two boiled eggs the next, back and forth forever. Let's add some RNG to this. What will the RNG be? Well, how about this, Let's say you can eat two fried eggs over medium with some veggies if you get the jackpot, 2nd place is cottage cheese, 3rd place is boiled eggs, and last place is skip a solid breakfast, and have a glass of metamucil, and a protein shake. Okay, that rule seems a little intricate, maybe, but pretty straightforward. I don't see anything weird going on here. Definitely still normal person stuff. Normal normal person doing normal stuff.\n\nJackpot if you can go the whole night without getting up to whiz. 2nd place if you only get up once, and it's after 3 am. 3rd place, you whiz before 3 am and 4th place you whiz more than once through the night. \n\nBecause, for me, December of 2024 I was peeing 3 times a night, minimum, and I don't think I could go much more than 2 hours between trips to the urinal. \n\nAnd, now, 10 months and 10 days (9 months and 7 days with Mounjaro) into this leg of the adventure, I'm down 97 lbs at 6'3\". I weighed 228 this morning, and, while that still puts me in the \"overweight\" BMI range at 28.5, that's far better than the 41+ I started at. I'm still losing at 2 lbs a week. I'm aiming for 195. That's 33 lbs away. I could be there by the end of January if I can maintain this pace.\n\nMy blood glucose is very well managed. I aim for tight control, and I wear a CGM. Every metric of my health the doctors test for has improved to mostly the \"good\" range, with a few outside of the comfort zone, but not exactly the danger zone. Just the danger close zone. \n\nA few other peculiarities, I only allow myself 1/2 of an apple per day, or pear. I ate an orange over the course of a week. No more than two supremes per day, by volume. roughly 1/4 of an orange at a time, once a day. \n\nI aimed to consume 1,650 calories a day, and I am probably well below that many days. 3-4 days a week I might have to intentionally force myself to eat 1,200 calories worth of food.",

Plan ahead so you aren’t left in a position where you either go hungry and crash, or mess up your food routine. \n\nMy secret trick that really helped compared to previous diets: no more sweetness in any form.  Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you, but when I consumed them the actual healthy nutritive foods tasted worse and my carb craving never went away.  It’s not about insulin response or the effects of artificial sweeteners - it’s about your palette.  Since cutting diet soda, dessert alternatives, etc I haven’t wanted anything sweet or felt the need or desire to cheat.",

I think mostly I'm closer to 100 but I think that's a good guideline\n\nEat protein and fat with carbs - if I snack on a cup of Smartfood (7-8 carbs) I add in some nuts. Nuts are funny to me as I've always avoided them like the plague because Fat Is The Enemy. I've had to adjust that mindset because nuts are a good snack for diabetics though never completely ignore fat content - its still important to eat healthy\n\nIf you eat more carbs than you feel great with drink a LOT of water. And go for a brisk walk - even if its only 15 minutes\n\nEat until you are satisfied - not until you are full\n\nIdeally if you have a testing kit when you eat something you question will cause a spike test 2 hours after that first bite of food - this is how I've learned what I can eat which, crazy, includes 1/4 cup of local farm icecream. \n\nIts less about completely limiting your carb intake and more about portion control. That was arguably the biggest thing for me to internalize\n\nI use Mounjaro once a week and this medicine has caused some of my biggest learning curves. Fried food - even a chicken tender on a big salad - makes me puke. Too much acid? Puke. Too much food in my stomach - and we aren't talking stuffed feeling, we're talking not very much food - makes me puke. Moujaro -and I think Ozempic - slows down your gastric emptying. When I do puke from whatever I did wrong on it I'm usually losing at least 3-4 meals (dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner). I doubt everyone's experiences are the same but nausea is a common Mounjaro side effect which is why I really wanted to mention this.",

        "body": "Hey! Welcome and sorry that you had to join the club! Honestly, my reaction was self pity, and hatred at least for a few days, but it did fuel me to create goals for myself. So while I wouldn't recommend the self loathing bit, I definitely would recommend creating attainable and measurable goals, both short and long term. \n\nFood, I'd say, YMMV, but make sure you can stick with your plan of attack, and again, measure your changes. If things aren't working, adapt and adjust. I went from super strict keto, to low carb, and now to lower carb but higher fibre, and lower sat fats. This changed as my numbers (A1c, cholesterol, weight, etc.) did, and I'm at a point where I feel like how I eat is sustainable for me. \n\nExercise, is definitely great, but find things that you enjoy to do, and will enjoy to do for a long time. Personally, I like golfing and I can combine my walking with that instead of taking a cart. I took up running as a challenge, and did a couple 5k races and a 10k race. I have some weights set up at home, that I use 3 days a week, especially in the winter, even if it's only for 20 mins at a time. Again, if you can find activities, or sports, or active hobbies that you can enjoy over a long period or even lifetime, the easier fitting exercise in your life will be. \n\nModern medicine is great, and GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic are incredible tools if they work for you, and help you achieve your goals. Many want to be unmedicated, but it's essential that you do what's best for you, and don't get discouraged if a medicated path is what's necessary. \n\nOn top of that, this community, particularly, is a great place to share successes, challenges, ask questions, glean information from, and even offer help/advice that you will gain over the course of your diabetic journey. The fact that you're here early on will be a boon to getting you on your way to your goals.",

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes about 10 years ago. Over the past 2 years I have lost over 150 pounds. I still want to drop 40 more pounds to get to my target. I have been watching my diet carefully and exercising 4-5 hours in a typical week. Over the last 4 months my doctor has weaned me off meds as my A1C was 4.6% and 4.5% on my last two visits. He started by having me stop taking Jardiance.  Then on my last visit about 2 weeks ago he had me stop taking Metformin and Victoza. Right now I'm taking no meds for diabetes.  I am on a CGM to monitor the results. From a blood sugar perspective everything appears to be good, except it does seem to take longer that normal for my blood sugar to come back down after a meal.\n\nThe only problem is that my weight loss has stalled.  Right after stopping all meds my weight went up by about 4 pounds.  I think that was primarily due to a change in how my body's digestive functions were working. Now, despite the intense workouts and highly limited low carb meals, I'm not losing weight like I once was. (I'd typically lose 3-5 pounds in a typical week. In the last 2 weeks now I'm up 3 pounds.)\n\nI go back to the doctor in about 3 weeks. At that visit I'd like to talk to him about adding back one of my prescription meds to help resume my weight loss. Of the 3 meds I have taken--Metformin, Victoza, and Jardiance--which one would be the best one to resume from a weight loss perspective? I will talk to my doctor before resuming, but I think if I advocated for one in particular he would likely approve.\n\nOne side challenge is that my long term PCP is retiring at the end of the year so my upcoming visit will be my last one with him.  I start a new doctor in March.",

I put the calibration drift down to changes in hydration though I'm unsure what causes it.\n\nOther factors can affect it temporarily though, such as compression lows at night which happen due to pressure on the sensor if you lie on top of it, and temperature changes such as going out in cold weather or having a hot shower.  If it's still giving you inaccurate readings after a couple of days wear and calibration doesn't fix it you can often get a free replacement sensor, depending on how far off the mark the CGM readings are.",

My A1c hasn’t been “high enough” nor any other health issues bad enough for my insurance to allow the script to be approved. \n\nKaiser Permanente, btw. I have a hate/like preference to this. Like the lower costs, hate the many, many hoops.\n\nI have also been treating my very low hormone levels treated with prescription meds - for Estrogen, Progesterone AND testosterone. As I’ve gotten those balanced better, my daily glucose readings have gotten better, and recent A1C dropped from 7.4 to 6.9. No change in diet or exercise or diabetic medication levels.\n\nI’ve also lost and kept off about 5-7 pounds. (Instead of gaining and losing those repeatedly). I’m also sleeping better, not dealing with carb cravings and have most of my mental clarity back.\n\nHormone levels drop can cause issues for every gender. If you are struggling with symptoms related to an imbalance with hormones, please pursue it and get it checked. It might be the key to gaining success in treating t2d.\n\n",

A CGM technically could be used in some places for diagnosis; however the culture is strongly oriented around measuring A1C so CGMs normally are not approved for that purpose, nor are doctors trained to use them that way. A1C shows overall blood glucose over a long time. CGMs will show how your body is responding to food; but hitting 220 glucose could just be pigging out on candy or drinking sugar cane juice. So with knowledge and context a lot of trained professionals and look at the CGM data and see clear diabetes. But still in most places health insurance will require the A1C  as seen by a doctor to pay for treatment. \n\nI do think that in the next 15 years it is likely that people will spend some time each year with a CGM if they are at risk of diabetes. However the A1C test is extremely cheap so I doubt that the \"rules\" and normal behavior will switch much. \n\nDo understand, it cost potentially 2000 dollars a month to be on these things 10 years ago.  Most doctors I have talked to are either in that mindset or use them all the time because they know they are affordable now. \n\nAll this said, I would have to go review current applications research: but I think prediabetes would be more visible on a CGM than via A1C measurement. So its possible pre-diabetes in at risk populations will get an alternate diagnostic criteria based on CGM data.",

What usually shows up are things like high fasting or overnight readings 130–180+ post-meal spikes well over 200 that take hours to come down, or, in early T1D, wild swings even with small meals. Seeing those patterns often pushes people to get labs done, which ends up confirming diabetes.",

I cry when I buy shoes for several reasons, cost is one, and the number of issues I have purchasing them is another.\n\nIf you have arch pain, look into orthotics if they're covered by your insurance or by health care, literally life changing.\n\nNicer quality shoes are around that $100-200 mark (in Canada, which has similar exchange to AUD). The shoes I normally buy are more than that, but I have tried on a lot of pairs by the time I give up and spend the amount I do. See if you can go to a specialized store to get them fit if possible, it will narrow brands down (I can't wear Hoka or Nike). Try a specialty walking shoe store or running shoe store (Pace in Sydney shoes up in a quick Google). The specialty stores, at least here, have people who know several brands better than the general shoe or sports stores at malls and many of them have solid advice.\n\nI hate runners, but have had to go to specialty stores for walking shoes, hiking boots, and ski boots. Better experience and results than the mall stores each time. Bonus points if they know a cobbler or have an on-site one who can help with fit, but cobblers are getting rare.\n\nMephisto make good (but quite expensive, I cry when I buy) walking shoes that have kept me walking for about 8 years.

        "body": "You don't have to buy there, but go to a New Balance and use their foot/ankle scanner.  I went to several and it was very consistent with issues I have.  Gives you a better idea of size and a type of shoe in the sense of ankle or pressure areas.\n\nUse a string/floss/piece of paper and get a line from center of shoe heel to center of toe.  If sole is equal both sides, the shoe is neutral.  More on the inside of the shoe, pronation.  More on the outside of sole, supination.  Sometimes your foot issue can be you're wearing the wrong shoe for your feet.  The scan helps with this.  Any shoe you have which doesn't work for your pressure/walk style, get rid of it.  \n\nSo the cheap shoes are for men under 180 pounds and women under 140 pounds.  You can get away with cheat materials they use on these.  If you're over on weight (not asking), the cushioning, toe box, ankle box will be sturdier (obviously all brands aren't the same) to support the pressure you're putting on your feet.  If you don't plan to buy several pairs, you should get a solid shoe to last a while.  \nArch support -- scan will help with your arch type and help you either pick a shoe or the right support.  Very key, especially for people over the weights above.  \nI wish you good luck in your search for a proper shoe.  If you're going to spend $200 on a shoe that will last 6-12 months, spend the $200ish on (just my honest opinion) something like Z-Coil.  The shoes last about 10 years (I get 8-10 including the laces last that long), sping/heel is easy to replace, they take 1/2 the impact out of foot strike so you basically spend $20-25/year for a pair of shoes.  There are other shoes like G-Defy, but I haven't tried them or can vouch how long they last.",

Many in the US have what they call ifit not the video workout ifit it just measures you walking stride, how you stand - basically your feet standing in 3d mode.  So they can determine what type of stuff is going  on qith your walking &amp;feet. Like pronation - do you have it and how bad it is. Do you need a rise step. Do you walk straight or lean your feet one way or the other - like knee knotted or toes pointing together.  What you stride looks and feels like.  So after all that they will recommend shoe brands and styles that work best for your feet and activities.  So for me hoka bondi or NB 880 worked for me best.",

Now with this new diagnosis I am struggling a bit to adjust, i am doing my part with exercise &amp; I know to eat more greens and not the starchy ones I believe, stay away from bread and carbs, no sugary anything and if I’m on the go I’m trying to find fast food places and meals from them that won’t hurt me too much if eaten and I just want to ask how did you deal with some of these issues when first diagnosed? Do you have any advice? \nI honestly miss sodas more than anything and was wondering if sugar free options were okay? Are sugar free options for desserts okay also? Can I still eat cheese? Is crystal light okay for replacing sodas? I’m just a bit overwhelmed by this new news and still am trying to figure out a plan and how to deal with all of this. \nAnything helps, thank you.",

Where I live in was able to attend digital and in person classes as well as booking in time with a nutritionist. \n\nAlso acquiring a prescription for CGMs will help huge. This thing was my worst enemy at first but it's a huge help now. Do lots of research on how they work too since they dont always explain the ins and outs of them. \n\nWhen it comes to fast food I try to cut back but if course thats not always an option. What I do now is find the most protein and fats and lowest amount of carbs. If I go to McDonald's I grab 2 double cheese burgers, remove ketchup, add mayo (removes sugar from ketchup) and then remove 1 bun from each, combine them to make a quad cheese burger. Alternatively if there's a quick chicken wing joint I'll get wings and veggies and my numbers barely move. \n\nI have sugar free sodas once in a while and they dont affect me. I try and stick to water and maybe a coffee without sugar. Anything sugar free doesnt hit me at all including the rare sugar free energy drink. Green and black tea is decent too i just add 0 sugar creamer and sweetener.\n\nYou're already doing the right thing by asking questions so good job there. Its a long road but it's about progress not perfection. You're gonna slip, have good days and bad, but they all pass just do your best the next day. I've been through the new diagnosis shock, depression, fear of food but I learned what affects me and how and almost 8 months in im under control and calm. You'll get there like the rest of us",

I'm down 40 lbs, and I feel great aside from getting lightheaded sometimes when I stand up, and my hands tingling if I lay on an arm or too long. \n\nI went for my blood draw yesterday around noon and hadn't eaten since 6pm the evening before (needed to be fasted.) I did a finger prick right before I walked in and it showed 91. Which is a new low for me, I've been hovering around 100. But the glucose level that came back from my bloodwork ended up being 69, so that's a frustrating difference, and also annoying because I've spent the past 3 months working to lower my fasting glucose, and now it reads too low? \n\nSome of my other numbers are high now. In those 3 months my LDL went from 109 to 148 (normal range is 0-130.) My diet pretty much consists of eggs, chicken, turkey, pork, salads, and lots of cheese and nuts. I'll also have a slice of ezekiel with avocado or peanut butter (just peanuts) a few times a week, and an occasional whey protein shake with unsweetened almond milk. So I'm thinking it might be the excessive cheese and nuts, maybe along with the pork? I'd really love any thoughts about this as I try to map out what my diet looks like for the next 3 months to lower my LDL. (If it helps, total cholesterol is 191 with a normal range being &lt;=200. Triglycerides are 56 and HDL is 32, both within normal ranges.)\n\nThe other one that is high is Anion Gap at 17.2 (normal range 6-15.) I looked into this one and it seems it could be high because my body was fasted and I'm ketosis, which I think is actually a good thing... should I worry about this one? \n\nEdit to add: I've also been eating a lot of beef sticks/turkey sticks. I don't want to leave that out as it may be contributing to my high LDL.",

The dosing guidelines also say that you can increase your dose past 5mg as needed for additional blood sugar control. This can all be found on their website: https://mounjaro.lilly.com/hcp/getting-patients-started \n\nIt might be worth it to get a second opinion.

If so, you probably need to go up to the next level because your body has gotten used to it. The idea is to keep increasing doses each month until your body adjusts. \n\nPersonally the 5mg is good for me to stay on because I’m not super hungry so there no need to restrict what I’m eating to help with my blood sugars.

I've tested my blood glucose once or twice a day for most days. While I tested my glucose levels, I thought I would expect a similar number if I pricked my fingers multiple times but I've consistently been getting readings of eight to 20 or more mg/dl during the same pricking session. I use the True Metrix blood glucose monitor if you guys are wondering. Im guessing one issue could be that my machine might not be reading right. To find this out i went online and bough the True Metrix glucose meter control solutions. These solutions should be arriving next week and I will test my monitor for accuracy. If I find the monitor is accurate next week, then what might be causing the different readings? Does the quantity of blood entering the test strip affect the results? Does pricking different fingers affect the results? I doubt its the fingers since its the same blood but I could be wrong. \n\nAre you guys also experiencing this? How many times are you guys pricking your fingers during the same session? I like to do it twice to see what the number says because I dont trust one solo reading. Thanks!",

If you go into calorie deficit for an extended period your body will try to hold onto fat reserves through metabolic adaptation.  One of the effects I observed via Fitbit and Garmin fitness trackers is reduced resting heart rate.  Heartbeats burn some calories.  I also experienced cold hands and feet sometimes, which is apparently the body trying to save on calories burned to keep your body warm, and while I only felt truly faint once or twice I did regularly feel drained of energy, sluggish, on days when I was actively trying to lose weight fast.  Also constipated, which is apparently the body slowing down digestion to try to extract as much energy from food in the gut as possible.\n\nAround an hour after even one big meal and I'd feel fine again and my resting heart rate would go back up after being well fed for a couple of days.

I didn’t realize that I was critically low. It was just before lunch. The one fellow was just about to call an ambulance. He offered me a candy of some type and while I wasn’t much better, I was starting to come out of my fugue. The other dude told me today that he thought I might have been having a stroke. He led me to the break room to have my lunch. I came back to normal after lunch. \n\nThese dudes are good solid folks, and I am grateful to work with folks who pay attention enough to know that something is not right with me. I thanked them profusely today for being good folks, and for looking out for me. \n\nI did also point out that if I am acting off again, to remind me of the juice boxes I always have with me.

The good thing is you might not have to stay on them forever and you can get a cgm if you end up on insulin. I bet they advise some sort of long lasting insulin. I was on 30u of Lantus once a day at first.\n\nI found out in January. 12.7 a1c. My glucose was in the high 900's. DKA and a 4 day ICU stay. With an immediate change in diet and started getting in as many steps a day as a could. Eventually working up to 20 to 25k steps 5 days a week. Plus 3 fast and 1 long lasting insulin shots a day and 2000mg of metformin. I brought my A1c down to 9.8 in 30 days. 90 days later I had a 5.2 a1c. Resting 98. Came off the fast acting at that time. 90 days later. Another 5.2 and dropped the long lasting and stepped down to 1000mg of metformin. About 6 weeks later. I was going hypo just from the Metformin and excerise. So we stopped that. The more you keep the healthy lifestyle the more your body can heal as much as it can.\n\nYou seem to be in a situation where you could potentially do what ive done. Maybe not but finding the right combination will be worth it in the long run.\n\nI'm making a big assumption with this next thougt. So I apologize in advance if Im wrong. The title of this saying, \"You're ready\". Took me as, you didn't want to take meds and have come to see a need. It takes a lot to admit they need meds from some and if that is you. Congratulations for making a hard decision.\n\nI would only suggest more cardio. A 30 minute brisk walk might get you around 2k steps, give or take. Depending on your stride. I personally take a 30 minute walk 3 times a day. 5 days a week. One in the morning before work. One right after work and o e after dinner. With just normal moving around each day that gets me around 12 to 15k a day. For me personally. I got much better overall results with mostly cardio. Walking, kayaking. Bike rides. I eat a lot of protein to maintain muscle mass. 100 grams or more a day. \n\nThats just my .02 though. You do what works for you",

Back in July I unexpectedly found out I was diabetic after finding a high amount of sugar in my urine and being urged to go to the ER for immediate bloodwork. \n\nI’ve been put on 5mg of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) the last month or so and have been keeping myself active between my walking commute and my post-dinner walks (aka my hot girl walks). \n\nI cut down carbs as much as possible, granted my dietitian told me 20g or less for main meals and managed to lose about 20 pounds in about 3 months. Admittingly, being put on medication had allowed me to be a little more lenient with myself but I still watch carbs and sugar intake. \n\nI’ve learned from both my doctor and dietitian that restricting myself from foods that I love is not the answer. Allowing myself to have things I love like ramen every blue moon is ok, and this has helped my mental health so much. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed I was having constant mental breakdowns. I felt like I couldn’t handle this diagnosis, despite being told a 7.6 isn’t horrible. But knowing how far I’ve come in such a short time, makes me think I can really do this for the long run. It’s not going to be all positive, and as my dietitian told me, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nBut my point is, I wanted to share my progress to show that things *do* get better, even when you think they won’t.

One in particular, was a 2 day delay in getting a prescription switched from one to the another. As one didn't have what they needed. Reminded me of an experience I had.\n\nI spent most my life living in Southern California. Lived in Manhattan for some years. Always hated pharmacies. Big chains rule in places like that. Since moving to a very small town in Ohio. You notice little differences that end up becoming HUGE differences. \n\nThere is a CVS on the corner right across the street from a locally owned pharmacy. Couldnt be in more direct competition with each other if they tried. After my ICU stay for DKA. I had my prescriptions sent to the local pharmacy. Got there, tried to use my HSA card and it wouldn't work on their machine.  Walked across the street switched the prescription and card still didn't work. Ugh.\n\nI start making phone calls. Next thing, im getting a call from the local pharmacy. Instead of letting me just go. They had been in the phone trying figure out from their end what might have been wrong. They actually told me what to do to fix the issue. Of course I went back to them. For about 6 months despite every prescription I have written to the local place. Somehow CVS still got it first and I have to have to switched. Even after going into CVS twice to tell them to never fill my prescriptions. I dont even know how they call it \"FILLED\" if I never picked it up. \n\nThis pharmacist goes above and beyond for me every time I walk in the door. They literally have two 10 ft rows of product to sell. Not one soda or bag of chips. No candy. Although they do sell locally harvested raw honey. Just prescription drugs and useful medical products. If you need something from one of those shelves. They walk out and grab it for you, if you missed it. If they dont carry it and you actually use it a lot. They'll carry it for you. \n\nLong-winded way to say. Give the small guy a shot. They just might knock your socks off. They dont let me have issues with my meds. They take that on, or at least give me good advise on how to get it down. We all know how important meds can be to us and the little guy took away my huge worries. ",

Then, what you see is the result of that medication... each acts in a certain way to either cut down glucose conversion or to expel it effectively. \nIf you are seeing improvement after diet changes, you are not giving your body the same type and amount of food to raise sugar as much as before.\nIf you're exercising more, you're just burning more.\n\nIn short, as far as I understand, all address the symptom, not the root cause.\n\nWould love to read expert inshights.

Even used my walking pad for the first time and walked for ever 30 minutes after. After the walk I had 2 handfuls of Costco trail mix which maybe had 4 m&amp;ms total. \n\nI noticed the longer rise last night before bed which never happens so I chugged about a liter or water and decided to do another workout (squats, sit ups and push ups) before bed in the hopes of dropping it and it just made it go above 12. \n\nI know this happens depending what you eat before bed especially but I thought I did it all right. I took my meds with dinner (1000 mg metformin) and worked out with a fairly balanced meal im familiar with. \n\nIf there's any decent advice for what to do or what could cause this id really appreciate it",

I didn’t have any major symptoms, and my glucose levels are now fairly stable after making some diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nI have a busy schedule (10 AM–6 PM), so I usually work out early morning or evening. Right now, I walk 10k–15k steps daily and do some light dumbbell workouts at home.\n\nMy goal is to lower my HbA1c when I recheck it after 3 months, while also losing fat and getting toned.\n\nI’m unsure whether this routine is enough for good results or if I should join a gym for faster progress.\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve improved their HbA1c and fitness — did walking alone work for you, or did gym workouts make a bigger difference?\n\n\n",

All of your activity and exercise helps grow your deficit, but it's not burning as much as you think. It's usually over-estimated.\n\nThe gym won't necessarily give you faster progress, but it will give you more options beyond your handweights. There's also a layer of social pressure that keeps you going further than you would at home, especially without distractions. \n\nTo control your diabetes, it sounds like you're doing what you should.

A day of working out will keep my numbers low for several days afterwards.  The key is to workout for a full 60 minutes, otherwise a shorter workout will actually cause your numbers to rise, not fall.  A 10 to 15 minute walk 30 to 60 minutes after meal is also huge and blunts the spike from a meal.  It won't stop a rise completely, but it does wonders.

That's probably for the best as it was essentially untamed gluttony. Drinking straight fruit juice is one step away from drinking sugar water. The taste of sodas have been on the decline for years now. For the most part, 80% of what I should avoid ingesting was terrible to begin with. \n\nNot being able to gorge on fruit and avoiding traditionally healthy breads like sourdough kind've sucks but realistically type 2 diabetes just forces you to live a lifestyle that everyone should be doing in the first place: eating whole foods that include primarily vegetables and full proteins while doing enough exercise to build and maintain muscle. Carbs and sugars are entirely unnecessary for a healthy individual to need to consume, they're purely for luxury or if in extreme cases you'd need carbs for fuel doing extended physical labor, which if we're being honest here, a majority of type 2 diabetics aren't in that situation.

Its resistance to sugars is so messed up that your glucose goes high. \n\nI have diabetes because of a family history of diabetes. The food choices I might have made may have contributed to poorer health, but it isn't the cause of it. The cause is that I genetically carried diabetes. So when it took effect, I wasn't able to regulate my thrist and hunger well. I craved more salt, sugar, starches, and carbs and in higher amounts.\n\nMaybe I'm off, I'm not a doctor, but this is my understanding of it.

I decided to stop because that was the goal.. in October I got careless and started eating whatever I wanted.. I am now suffering the consequences of that.. my FBS every morning has been 5.7-6.4 range for a week now (before it was only between 4-5.5). I stopped eating sweets and high carbs recently but I’m scared that I did this again to myself and I really regret it. 😞 Also I’m thinking should I take metformin again? I know I should ask the doctor but he gave me the decision last time (I recently moved to a rural area where there’s only 1 clinic so no other options around) \n\nThank you in advance for any input or advice.

    "selftext": "Hi all - my father (age 72) recently stopped taking the medication Januvia for his type 2 diabetes after having a reaction to the medication. Long story short, he was on Januvia for 6 years - suddenly had some all over body itching as a result of low kidney function due to the medication. His doctor took him off the Januvia suddenly. Just like that, after 6 years, stopped taking it. Hasn’t replaced the medication with anything else. This was about 4 weeks ago. Since then he’s been suffering from blurry vision, light headedness, low appetite, feeling “off balance”, and just not himself. He went to the ER last week.. they did a CT, blood work, etc.. all the things that came back normal. We say one of his PCP’s partners today and she thought he might have positional vertigo. We were able to do a same day with a physical therapist who after doing a few maneuvers said it is not vertigo. His blood sugars are testing back in range. They fluctuate but nothing out of what is considered ordinary.  \n\nHas anyone else stopped Januvia suddenly and have had similar experiences with symptoms? What did you do? When did it subside? We are starting to wonder if his body just needs some time to regulate and get back to normal. We’ve done all the things and have found out a lot about what isn’t wrong with him… but it’s easy to see he’s frustrated and anxious. He’s an incredibly healthy person - eats well, goes to the YMCA 2-3 times a week to lift weights and walk, and does all the things to be healthy. He’s been staying home, not going much of anywhere, etc…  and I just want to help him. \n\nLet me know if anyone else has a similar story! Thank you! 😊 ",

First, let me address hbA1c. hbA1c, despite the common belief, does not measure glucose or average glucose. It measures the amount of glycated (damaged) red blood cells in a sample. So just rephrase the question: is it bad to reduce the amount of damage I'm doing to my red blood cells? Obviously not. \n\nRapid reduction in glucose can aggravate neuropathy, cause temporary changes in vision that can last up to a month, aggravate retinopathy or, in severe cases, cause NAION, a very serious eye condition. \n\nShould you try to maintain high glucose levels and reduce slowly? That's a question for a doctor who knows your history. For me, I dropped from hbA1c of 10.6 to 4.8 in 111 days. FGL from 309 to 85. I did have temporary changes to my eyesight that lasted almost 3 weeks. That can be scary but I was familiar with the physiology before I started getting my body on the right track.",

I'm not sure about the exact specifics, but it's an indication of your red blood cells having a coating of glucose,  like the candy shell on M&amp;M's.  This coating makes the red blood cell unable to carry a much oxygen as it should.   Increasing that capacity faster than you adapt to the change can leave you feeling lightheaded.",

My fasting BG is regularly below 100, and i rarely get over 120 after meals. I achieved this through a somewhat low carb diet (net carbs around 130-140g per day), medication (750mg of metformin twice) and lots of regular exercise, at least 30 mins per day and 2-3 more intense sessions per week. My results are very aligned to what I’m doing.\n\nIf you’re not starving yourself or doing something dramatic or harmful, and your doctor is not raising any concerns, then I’d be inclined to think it’s fine. It also matter how YOU feel, because when you’re more healthy you genuinely do feel it.",

Your insulin response isn't great (thus the diabetes!) but you've still got some good pancreas function going on and making life easier through diet/exercise/meds is enough to bring you to healthy levels fairly easily. (not to diminish your work - its important, and hard! but later stages of T2 work hard too for lesser results.)\n\nYou'll see a story here pretty much every day of someone recently diagnosed and with great improvement 90 days later.\n\nIts a good time to be tuned into any complication symptoms - especially in your vision. Generally these are benign, unusual, and temporary but should 100% be checked out if they occur.",

For example, after I eat sourdough bread (artisan) my BG can go up 20-30 points after 45 mins of eating, but around 1.5 -2 hours PPG is back down to what it was before. Do we consider this a spike or a normal response? Are we to only look at 2 hour PPG? I know that eating carbs raises BG even in non diabetic people, but I am just confused on if I should consider this a true spike or a normal response to carbs. \n\nThanks in advance! ",

A spike occurs in response to carbohydrates and proteins.\n\nMost people reach their peak between 45 and 75 minutes after eating, with the average being around 60 minutes. The peak represents the highest point your glucose level reaches after the first bite. A peak that’s too high can be a problem if reactive hypoglycemia is an issue, as it is in my case. I’m one of the “lucky” ones, so I have to keep my peak below 160.\n\nThe two hour goal, measured two hours after the first bite can vary depending on an individual’s situation and diabetes management goals. For example, I aim to stay below 140 two hours after first bite because I’m working toward maintaining a normal A1C.",
