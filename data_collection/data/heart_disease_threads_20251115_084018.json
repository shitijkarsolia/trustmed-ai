That's awesome! \n\nYesterday was my son's birthday party, and I went stupid with the pizza and ate like 6 friggen slices from Dominos. I had a very stressful, unrestful night, and woke up feeling lightheaded and dissociative. My heart rate was lower than usual, pulse ox said my o2 was fine, then did another BP: First number was like 160/100, then after a few did it again and it lowered, but still averaging 150/95+\n\nI've been back on Losartan for a couple days now, but I missed yesterday. So I guess the questions are - Can a really bad meal cause these numbers today? Did the crummy sleep contribute to it? Is it rebound hypertension from a missed day? How did I get perfect numbers 2 days ago and now it's so much higher?",

Stress and anxiety raises bp, but systolic is much more easily changeable and responds quickly to the physical symptoms of stress and anxiety - fast heart rate, quickened breathing, etc - so systolic shoots right up. Diastolic is slower to move, so it doesn't respond to anxiety, which is usually a short term episode. If its high all the time, it can be secondary cause, but can also be sedentary lifestyle,  or being overweight. Either way, usually something more long term that your system is having to work harder to counter. 200/80 type of bp usually has a high heart rate and means they've taken it mid panic attack, 200/120 means you need a bunch of tests to find out what's out of whack.

Usually my diastolic actually is quite high, sometimes 100.  Then, the PCP ignores or says don’t worry, just keep to a more regular exercise routine. \n\nPrior readings at appts: 130/82, 134/82, 141/101, 132/95, 129/90, and there was one other time diastolic was 100 and my pulse pressure was around 30-35. \n\nThis summer I got scared and started keeping a log at home. \n\nIn the morning, following all or most suggested relaxation protocols, my readings are usually around 110/70-125/85. \n\nIn the afternoon, I’ll have spikes up to 140/100. When I’m anxious I’ll still have 135/85-95 in the evening even after sitting quietly, but the reading usually goes down. One time I got 151/100 but I immediately remeasured and it came back 135/80. \n\nI used to get angina (resting and with exercise) in college but was dismissed as anxiety when I tried bringing it up at the ER or with my PCP. They did an EKG and it came back normal. My bp at dr appts was in the 130/80s range but I was marathon training. \n\nI had my first heart palpitation two days ago; I wasn’t having an anxiety attack but I was generally quite worried all day and having a migraine while driving (furloughed fed with a monthlong migraine, hard not to be anxious lol). \n\nQ’s: Should I be freaking out like every nurse seems to? \n\n\nBe more insistent with my PCP that we explore medication or see a cardiologist?\n\n Am I just freaking myself out by taking it multiple times a day?

    "selftext": "So, recently while doing a blood pressure test, I saw my systolic was 140 and my dystolic was 80. Due to my job (I clean at a movie theater), time, and frankly laziness, I hadn't had the time to cook for myself, or exercise. I do go walks but I very regularly eat (or ate) at places kike McDonald's or a local fried chicken joint)\n\nNow this has been the case for a while, over a year, and only now I am dealing with issues, with chest pain and arm pains (although I have dealt with that prior as I have bad anxiety). Currently shopping for a meal that won't kill me, but since I have barely eaten anything in the past couple days, is it a bad idea to say fuck it and go get a burger? ",

When I dont care about salt intake Im 135/80 when I do Im 105/60 (on a lot of meds, cause I def have HPB)\n\nAnd fast food equals insane amounts of salt. Normal people should only have 6g of salt a day, people with HBP only 3g. The average person gets about 10-12g a day. Like one Big Mac is 42% of your daily salt. So thats without the fries and whatever else you order, plus all other food and surprisingly a fair few drinks a day. \n\nMost things baked are terrible as well salt. From 'healthy' bread to donuts. One donut, boom 1g of salt or more.",

Independent cardiologists often highlight that the *repeated micro-stimulation of the sympathetic system* is what wears down the heart over time, even if “no formal hypertension” is observed in the early studies.\n\n\n\n# Plain Language Summary\n\n* Yes, nicotine pouches raise blood pressure transiently.\n* Chronic use likely increases long-term cardiovascular risk modestly.\n* If you already have hypertension or anxiety, it’s a poor choice.\n* If your blood pressure is healthy and you’re using them occasionally, the risk is relatively small — **but not zero**.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! Some background on me I’m 37 yo had two children first child was the first time I was diagnosed with hypertension in pregnancy (27 years old at the time) was on meds during pregnancy delivered and did well getting off. During this though began my dread of the blood pressure machine… my second child I took baby aspirin and did not develop high enough BP to be put on medication I was 34 then. Every time I go to the doctors though my BP is high I need to breathe relax it finally lowers even at home I have a machine my first reading will be high up to 140+/90+ but then I breathe relax and I get a good reading… now to yesterday I had an appt at a new OBGYN in the waiting room an older woman was screaming and it honestly brought me back to my childhood almost like a PTSD thing bc she reminded me of my grandmother. I texted my husband omg my anxiety is through the roof. I go in they take my BP it’s 170/110 (I’ve never in my life had a high reading like that) they tell me you need to go to ER at first then finally say go home you look ok but see you PCP. I go home thinking it’ll go down and take it myself and it’s high so I did end up going to the ER - they did EKG kidney function test chest xray and heart blood test everything was great! They said it seems it’s asymptomatic hypertension induced by anxiety… \n\nMy question is this really if you made it this far if you were me on Tuesday at my PCP would you go in blood pressure medicine and if so what advice do you have? I’m so sick of this I honestly avoid doctors at this point… because of it I am going to attach a copy of the reading I generally get at home \n\n\n(More info if needed: I go to the gym 4-5 x a week for 1-1.5 hours, I eat mostly healthy but I am overweight even though I keep working out) ",

They’re near enough perfect across the board barring the odd one ridiculously close so I’d put it down to anxiety related as you’ve said.

All my labs look perfect besides a thyroid one that was off just 0.4. I don't know what else to do. I've spent the last few weeks just spiraling out of control just making it worse im sure.

(they keep repeating to make sure and there's nothing left), what can i possibly do? my AASI on ABPM peaked at 0.82 in 2024; it was 0.64 last time a few months ago and 0.34 in 2023; in general they ruled out an \\*inherent heart problem\\* not caused by my hypertension, so i'm just stumped. i've been posting about it all this time on my twitter account; and i'm hoping to make some friends here and perhaps learn more; because i'm stumped.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwq6so7b6s0g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055421b2b125d17d09545b7b41601b6e25e5b62f\n\nfunnily enough; if you see a few readings i took on my home monitor (i had it checked)...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjftsj6e6s0g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43dadf92e95a86b37a951031735eead4263aff40\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szr1h36f6s0g1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2824f1d186b49f399d7e01b21cdecfe2e2530a5a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oknian4g6s0g1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c4df1eda1f390339d80d5032dcc84225590d49\n\n...you may note that i contributed the photo for hypertensive crisis on wikipedia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqu7ev8l6s0g1.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae09fc32d2e66eb5aa2c3c35d410e356963b8d85\n\nalso, this reading's quite a bit more dubious as it was in an emergency setting and they obviously did not fit an arterial line, but around february 2025 it seemed my blood pressure rose above 300 systolic; given that no manual or automatic blood pressure cuff from numerous paramedic crews could read my BP; inflating to the max and then returning an error for the automatic ones, and inflating to the max on the manual ones and having the lead paramedic just go \"i hear the sounds; i don't know what it is but it's extremely high\"; i had rang for chest pain. i'm hoping also to make some friends in this community; thank you.\n\nmy main question is what could possibly be at play here? i less just want to yap about my experience and more find some answers and discuss perhaps anyone with a similar age to me (18) who may have similar experiences; so i know i'm not alone. thank you very much. i'm also willing to answer any questions. \\~ erika",

        "body": "Hi, and welcome.  So you're only on two low dose meds at the moment, and your weekly average is 190/107? Heart rate always tachycardia? Or is that just while at hospital? I'm just wondering why you're not on a beta blocker yet and couldn't see on your post.\n\nI used to average 245/160 long term, also malignant, had an eye stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy,  cardiomegaly,  lowered ejection fraction (51), thickened chamber walls, tachycardia,  a murmer,  and chronic kidney disease from hypertensive nephropathy.  For me, tests found it was caused by a kidney failing after severe and chronic hydronephrosis, itself caused by damage from a surgery 4 years before, had been misdiagnosed as a kidney infection so went untreated.  I'm also autistic, incidentally! I'm on 10mg amlodipine,  2.5mg bisoprolol and 50mg losartan and it's worked well, eventually, to bring my bp down and my heart rate reasonably normal. Due to the meds, my heart returned to normal size and function,  though still have a murmur, and after 2 years I was discharged from the retinal clinic with only a small but permanent blind spot in one eye. The kidney disease is stable. \n\nSo hopefully they'll get you on meds that work for you and lower your bp slowly. I started at a higher average than yours so your mileage may vary,  and because of the heart stuff they wanted to lower it very slow, so for me it took about 8 months of my rested averages dropping like 3-5 points every week! Frustrating, especially those weeks where it didn't drop or I'd  go back up again, but it got there eventually.  I was told that it was likely I'd been averaging around 245/160 for 'months or years' so it needs to lower slowly to avoid more strokes, and more damage, so it might be quicker or slower for you. I hope they get you sorted soon!",

Less than a week into adding Eplerenone 25mg to the Labethol I had been taking - I started to see results.\n\nMy typical BP is about 160/100.  After a few days of taking the meds, I saw it start to drop to 125/95.\n\nSounds good right?  Well here is my concern - the last few days I've been experiencing light headedness and dizzy spells.  I know this is a symptom of regulating BP.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am an NHS GP in the UK with a big interest in blood pressure. Over the years I have noticed how many people struggle not because they lack motivation, but because tracking and understanding their readings is made far more confusing than it needs to be.\n\nI have been working on a simple, free app to help people keep their readings in one place and understand the basics without any noise. No cost, no ads, no push for anything at all. It is just something I wanted to build after seeing so many people feel lost or stressed about their numbers.\n\nI am sharing it here because I would genuinely value honest feedback from people who actually live with hypertension every day. If something is helpful, great. If something is annoying or pointless, I want to hear that too. The whole point is to make it more useful over time.\n\nIf anyone wants to share thoughts on what makes tracking easier or harder, I would really appreciate it. I am also happy to answer general questions about blood pressure if that helps.\n\nHere is our download link on the apple app store, android coming soon :) [https://apple.co/4nPKN2D](https://apple.co/4nPKN2D)\n\nDr Adam, GP in the UK!

Was on Metoprolol for about 4 months, but horrible side effects for me, so they switched me over to Nebivolol then.  I'm taking it because of high blood pressure.  I wasn't very kind to my body growing up, and had a couple AFib episodes about 4-5 years ago.  The thing is, they only happened after I drank heavily or went on a bender, which I mentioned repeatedly to my cardiologist at the time. One episode, they had to put me under and do a cardioversion. My blood pressure was averaging 140 over something before the medication. \n\nNow, I've had hardly any side effects from it, except for two.  And that is a complete lack of sex drive.  To the point of being almost non-existent.  And it's starting to severely affect my relationship.  She feels like it's something to do with her, and she has every right to feel that way.  I would were the roles reversed.  And I've assured her that is not the case.  But has anyone else had this problem on Nebivolol?  To this extent?  The other problem is quality of sleep.  I always wake up every two hours or so for no reason.  Not debilitating, but has definitely affected sleep amounts and quality over the years.\n\nI also take baby aspirin and Atorvastatin.  Now, about 6 months ago, I decided to change my lifestyle completely.  100 percent sober, exercise 4 times a week, and eat clean and healthy.  My BP now averages 115-120 over something, but I'm also still on the Nebivolol.  \n\nI'm seriously thinking about quitting it.  \n\nFor anyone that is no longer on it, did your sex drive improve?  Back to what it was before you started taking it?  Did your BP remain stable with diet and exercise alone?  Did your sleep quality improve any?  Thank you in advance and much appreciated.",

It's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed to talk about and it's a VERY common side effect of beta blockers, even Nebivolol, so they've heard it all.\n\nI also found that my sleep quality was pretty bad on Nebivolol. I've found extended release melatonin or delta 8 helped me a lot, but that's up to you to decide what to take.\n\nAdditionally, if Nebivolol is working well for you, ask if Sildenafil or Tadalafil is an option for you. They can be taken with beta blockers without serious side effects if they are monitored with your doctor.",

So no - not all are placebo, but some are anxiety, and some will be other health issues which could also be causing the high bp - or even 'just' side effects from the lifestyle that could be causing the bp, too.

Sometimes I think people don’t share their positive results enough, and it can really skew people’s ideas of what medicating hypertension will be like. I put off getting medicated for 15 years.\n\nMy story was basically diagnosed with hypertension at age 20 and didn’t start taking medication until age 35. In between I tried a variety of things such as drinking large amounts of beat and celery juice, eating so little sodium a day that I was getting headache, and trying to run 5K daily to make my hypertension go away.\n\n140 systolic to start creeping up to 150 and higher. \n\nI was so hesitant to try medicine because I had heard like the side effects were terrible and it doesn’t actually you know fix the problem—which I don’t deny.\n\nSitting in the doctors office one day after yet another high reading, I shared with the doctor the list of supplements I was taking, and he was like: “What you are trying to achieve can be gotten with medicine. And these medicines have gone through clinical trials. Your supplements from the vitamin store have not.” Further more I had left ventricle hypertension from the years of not treating it.\n\nThis was about a year ago. 50mg of Losartan a year later I have it under control. I even took that reading at a Wal Mart blood pressure machine which typically would give me high readings. \n\nI was lucky to find success on the first medicine prescribed. The pill along with some increased exercise and giving up bacon—I used to eat daily—led me here. I encourage those on fence to get medicated to please think about it. \n\nWish all the best.\n\n ",

    "selftext": "For context, I’m 29 now. I was first put on BP medication (amlodipine + telmisartan) when I was 20. At that time, I was 95 kg, obese, living on junk food, drinking heavily, smoking daily around 15 cigs and my clinic BP readings were around 150/100. Even at rest it used to be 140/90 on both those meds.\n\nDuring COVID, I lost 40 kgs with exercise and a clean diet and dropped to 59 kgs. My BP at the doctor’s office became 100/60, I felt light-headed all the time, so my doctor stopped amlodipine and eventually stopped all BP meds. This was after around 6 years of using them.\n\nSoon after, my BP started going up again (around 140/90), so telmisartan 40 mg was added back. For the next \\~3 years, even though I drank and smoked on weekends (12 beers + 1 pack of cigarettes sometimes), my in clinic BP stayed stable — usually 110/80 to 120/80. I felt completely fine. Never checked at home as i didnt have any obsessions about health. Even during severe headaches it barely went above 130. I had always been anxious but i was drinking a strong starbucks coffee as soon as i used to wake up which was causing severe palpatations and sweating all over. I thought why not check my bp in the morning but it was always great so i stopped and threw the machine away. i was frustrated. I was told that headaches are caused by high bp and i was sitting with perfectly normal bp even after a night of heavy drinking lol. I also continued exercising everyday.\n\nIn October 2023 everything changed. After a night of heavy drinking, I had my first panic attack — HR racing, BP at the hospital was \\~200, they gave me 0.25 mg clonazepam and within 30 mins it dropped to 120. That event triggered severe health anxiety.\n\nAt that time, I was also under major stress (job issues + relationship breakup). At the cardiologist’s clinic my BP was 146/92, echo and ECG were normal, but she still advised increasing telmisartan to 80 mg. I refused because I knew it was anxiety — just a few days before, while travelling in Bangkok, my BP was 120/70.\n\nThen I made the mistake of buying a BP machine. I checked repeatedly — first reading was 130, then 140, then 160, and by the fourth check it was 180. Panic → ER → normal tests → sent home. And this cycle repeated almost daily. I moved back to my parents’ house because of fear.\n\nSince then I’ve had:\n\n* 3 normal echocardiograms\n* 300+ normal ECGs\n* Normal kidney/liver function, thyroid, cortisol, electrolytes\n* Normal renal doppler, CT calcium score = 0\n* Normal TMT (12.7 METs), HbA1c 5.0, fasting sugar 85\n* Normal urinary metanephrines (so no pheochromocytoma)\n* hsCRP 0.1, no inflammation\n\nEvery ER visit was the same: BP 170–190/110, mild anti-anxiety med → BP drops to \\~140 → ECG is normal → discharge.\n\nLast year I started paroxetine. Within a month, my BP averaged 115/60, lowest was 110/49. But I stopped it because my obsession with checking BP didn’t stop. Then panic returned.\n\nNow what’s scaring me is: even when I’m calm, my BP has been around 132–135 systolic for the last few days. My doctor told me to stop checking it, but my whole body feels tense and I can’t tell whether it’s anxiety or actual high BP returning. In the morning however it was 115/65.

I thought I was gonna die. I was checking my BP and first reading was 160/80 which made thing worse. \n\nMy doctor at the time was a young doctor who had no experience with LIFE. She had experience with pills, medications and statistics. And new guidelines and borderlines for BP. So she gave me a strong dose of a combination pill called Amcandin (Amlodipine 10 mg and Candesartan (that I used before) 16 mg (double dose)) without asking what I do for myself, for my work or anything life related.\n\nEager to find a solution I started to use my watch daily and check my heart rate. Not a good idea. It worsened everything. I thought everything over 75 was going to kill me.\n\nThe medication also took life from me. Like literally, I wasn't the same, constantly tired, on the verge of passing out. But my BP average was 150/85.\n\nSo after a month of suffering and occasional drinking/smoking I decided to lower my alcohol intake/smoking, start eating healthier. Bought an exercise bike. Beetroot juice. Fish 3 times a week. No fast food, low fats, almost 0 salt. \n\nFor anxiety I took some natural based pills that you can buy in the pharmacy but are natural, non-addictive and cannot do anything else except relax you and your mind. I felt stoned and barely productive so after 3 weeks of using, I stopped. It kind of helped me sleep though. But I used that (still do) a lavender spray for pillows and sheets. Works wonders.\n\nBP remained high so I decided to take my health to a new, unknown level and went to a psychotherapist. Even though I spent much more money that I thought (4 sessions, 300€) I got some guidelines, that's it. I stopped therapy after 4 sessions because I had a feeling they wanted to maximize money take from me without providing too much help. Which confirmed after trying with 2 other psychotherapists. I wanted to work with something and all I got from them are questions, not guidelines or help, not even recommended books!\n\nWent to my cardiologist (somehow I got to him 3 months after last visit, even though I have a regular, 2 year check up) and he said \"you're a slave to your BP. Measure 1 or 2 times a week (more if it's high as hell, like over 160/90) but only in the morning and make sure you rest 10 minutes before, no eating 30 mins befre, etc. etc. you know the drill. You're clearly overdosed, we're gonna halve this amlodipine and go from there\"",

What helped me was a doctor at the ER who literally told me: \"You don't belong here and you're distracting our work with patients that really need us. I don't want to see you here again.\" This was a pivotal moment for me, I got my things soon sorted out.\n\nThat it goes up to 200 in a panic attack is not something unexpected. If you run up a steep hill with full effort it will be also in that range or even higher. What matters is how it is first thing in the morning and in the evening before you go to sleep. That being said I have much higher readings than you have when your readings are regular. I don't like what I see, but for that I have a GP to work with.\n\nPlease stop measuring that often. Get help with your anxiety/panic attacks and you likely will be fine. You're still young and enjoy the sportive activities you do. My fingers are crossed for you. 🙏",

For example, in the morning it is around 120/80, then throughout the day and in the early evening it is always around 140/80, and then in the evening, after I have relaxed for a while, it is back to around 120/80. I also notice that when I take several measurements in a row, my blood pressure drops by about 10-15. Should I have this checked by a doctor? Is it normal for blood pressure, especially systolic blood pressure, to be slightly higher during the day? I am 27 years old, do not smoke, and do not drink regularly. All in all, I would say that I have a relatively healthy lifestyle.\n\nThank you in advance!",

During those two years I lost 26lbs, reduced nicotine (from 120mg/day to 12mg/day) and caffeine (from 300mg/day to 40-60mg/day), and stuck to a low sodium diet. \n\nI was prescribed this because I went to the ER for a panic attack and they noticed my BP was 160/120 when I was there. \n\nWent to the doctor for my annual checkup a little over a week ago and they bumped me to 5mg after seeing that my numbers (also during a panic attack) were 150/92. \n\nLong story short I feel like the walking dead on the new dose. I’m sleeping at least 12 hours a day, and I have to drink crazy amounts of water to produce a normal amount of pee. I’m very rarely hungry and I often don’t notice that I’m hungry until I’m passing out from lack of food. I’ve also noticed that after orgasm my vision goes fucky and my chest feels sort of weird (not painful) for the rest of the day. \n\nMy resting BP (semi-reclined, under weighted blanket) on the new dose is 116/64. I don’t know exactly how I’m supposed to take it but that’s how they take it when I’m at the ER. I do it this way because without the weighted blanket my adrenaline will skyrocket and that affects my readings. Before I started doing this, about 75% of my readings were taken during panic attacks. \n\nOther conditions I have: severe panic disorder (8-9 panic attacks per day on average), TRT induced polycythemia, Klinefelter syndrome. \n\n",

        "body": "It's probably important to understand what these numbers mean.  The top number (systolic) is the pressure exerted when the heart pumps blood into the body.  The bottom number (diastolic) is essentially the \"baseline\" pressure of the circulatory system.  BP will shift and change constantly, with activity of any sort raising the pressure (both numbers) to support the activity.  This is done by the body's parasympathetic nervous system, it's literally what makes you function.\n\nTreatment of blood pressure is a game of averages, not peaks.  A non-hypertensive person will certainly have (much) higher than \"normal\" values under stress or activity, but that's a peak.  (Nor is it dangerous long term.)  If you average these readings over time and during periods of rest, you're just barely at the point where treatment is usually desirable.  Most doctors will refrain from treatment, due to the potential for medication issues, until its clearly necessary.  Furthermore, home based units can also be inaccurate.  (Many units provide a 3x test and provide an average, which help rule out errant tests.)",

Reading other peoples success stories gives me hope, a lot of the time their BP goes back to normal levels.\n\nI know not everyone can just ask/request for a random CT scan, but if you have other symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and joint pain, then I would ask your doctor to check your cortisol levels.

I’ve had high blood pressure almost my entire life and have been on hypertension medicine since I was 18, but recently it had become a much bigger issue. My readings were consistently in the 150–160/100–110 range.\n\nAbout three months ago, I had a colonoscopy. That evening, I developed severe stomach pain that sent me to the emergency room. I think something I ate may have triggered it, since they had removed some polyps, my stomach was probably irritated, which caused the extreme pain. During that ER visit, they did a CT scan and discovered a noncancerous tumor on my adrenal gland.\n\nAfter that, I followed up with my internist, who referred me to both an endocrinologist and a nephrologist. They diagnosed me with primary aldosteronism and started me on spironolactone, and finally, my blood pressure came down to a normal range. For now, my doctors say I don’t need to have the tumor removed, but it’s something I might consider in the future. They also ruled out Cushing’s syndrome.\n\nIt’s wild, if I hadn’t had that CT scan, I would’ve never known the tumor was even there.",

Seems like I got a record of +140 everytime I've gone and that day I got 155/82.\n\nThe doctor prescribed me enalapril 20mg/day. The reason was because I have low risk factors:\n- Healthy bodyweight and body fat\n- Exercise 5-7 days/week\n- Healthy food habits (95% home cooking, no sodas only water, etc)\n- No smoking\n- Occasionally drink (couple beers every 1-2 months)\n\nThat night he asked me to take 20mg, wait about 20min and check my BP (went down to 143/80).\n\nLater in the middle of the night, I suddenly woke up with my left arm tingling, feeling kinda tight and feeling odd (hard to describe, I guess like anxious). Didn't say anything to my wife, dealt with it for an hour and somewhat got back to sleep. Never in my life I've felt any of that\n\nNext day I went to pick up the pills, and I though better start taking them the next day to start in the morning and didn't want to experience the same thing if it had something to do with the pill. Nothing happen that night, slept good as usual.\n\nThe next day (yesterday) I took the first pill at 6:55AM. Went about my day, went a couple times to the clinic to check my BP (+150s again), they told me it takes about a week to start seeing a change (kinda inconsistent from what the doctor told me).\n\nThat night it happen again, woke up around 1:45AM. This time felt it a little more, more tight around my upper left chest and armpit, and some cold feeling around my arm as well. Right arm completely normal. And the most concerning thing was my heart beat was very slow and inconsistent like \". . _ . _ . . _ .\"\n\nCalled 911 and they told me an ambulance was on its way. They didn't show up, because according to them I'm not in immediate danger. This is public system it what it is. Around 3AM from being up it, the feelings went away and got back to sleep a little.\n\nI'm not taking it anymore until I speak with a cardiologist later today.\n\nHas someone ever experienced something like this?",

I have been seeing a cardiologist for my heart rate (not BP) issues, but over the past year my blood pressure has truly shot through the roof and caused a more pertinent issue for me. If I sit for a good 5 minutes and relax, it tends to be about 155/117 or so, but often throughout the day it is over 160/120.\n\nMy cardiologist's NP prescribed me amlodipine at 2.5mg a day, and told me it probably would not start lowering my BP for at least a week. My BP did not lower at all that week, as expected. Exactly one week after starting the med I woke up at 5:30 in the morning to my bones, muscles, joints, and skin aching. It felt like I had a bad flu, except I didn't feel sick or rundown at all, just in pain. \n\nCalled the dr, they said it's not an emergency, but I can stop taking the med if I want to. Um, yeah. I wouldn't keep taking it if they told me I had to. Anyway, I usually took it at like 1pm, but I skipped that day's dose, and the next day (today) I feel much, MUCH better.\n\nI just wanted to post this out to the internet because I know that it's a supposedly rare side effect, and some of my googling showed me people developing mild joint pain after over a year on the medication. I don't know if I would have even put the two and two together if I had been taking to so long. So here is my story, up for anyone who googles something similar. I do not mean this as a warning not to take it, definitely try it, but if you experience these side effects, it's not a coincidence and you aren't the first!\n\nAnother thing that I might have as a side effect of amlodipine is mouth ulcers (canker sores). I occasionally have one, but over the past week I have had two plus one developing. In the stuff I have read, mouth ulcers are actually a more common side effect of this drug than muscle/joint pain, and especially skin pain. Anyway, that's what I've been dealing with, and I would love to hear about other experiences on this medication, good or bad.",

Studies showing that many people get most accurate readings when seated 25 minutes first, but obviously we don't often get time for that. Have a read of the wiki here, it's got lots of info about accurate readings and so on. Good luck!",

    "selftext": "So like most of you I've been on medication a few years and I was determined to not be. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was the final push so I lost the weight (around 25kg or 55lbs) it was enough to bring my BP right down at the time I was on 10mg amlodipine and 2.5mg indapamide. I tapered off the amlodipine with the guidance of my gp at the time and it's been about a year. I carried on the indapamide as my BP was in a really good place and side effects were minimal. In the past few months my BP was getting too low again so random dizziness and the odd headache. I started tapering off the indapamide to try and prevent rebound as I tried once before but went cold turkey and my BP bounced to 160/90 in a few days. This time Ive been up and down a bit but used information from studies about diuretic withdrawal and got AI to make me a plan. I've followed it and my last dose was on the 28th of October. As of yesterday I'm finally in a normal range with a little bit of instability which should settle after a few more days. While indapamide was a great drug for controlling my BP I started getting a lot of rashes (I used to have eczema) so that was my deciding factor indapamide has also become hard to get hold of in the UK so I didn't want to get to the point of just running out. Attached is my graph of the past week or so and as you can it's been a bit up and down. So I wanted to give a bit of hope to others who don't have genetically enforced hypertension that you can resolve and get off medication... Obviously not the same for everyone but don't get comfy on medication if you don't need to be!\n",

        "body": "I completely agree with you — I’m a doctor, and what I always tell my patients is this: in the textbooks, the very first thing we read when it comes to managing any comorbidity, whether it’s hypertension or diabetes, is to guide the patient toward lifestyle changes. When we notice that the condition is more advanced or that the patient lacks the initial discipline, we start medication, because we need to prevent further damage to the body.\n\nBut the greatest gift is when a patient manages to change their lifestyle and decides they don’t want to depend on medication. That’s truly powerful. However, as others have said, the transition must be appropriate, controlled, and continuously evaluated — since medication helps regulate various body responses that lower blood pressure, and sometimes it takes a while for its effects to wear off.\n\nI always suggest this to people — I already have 13 Reddit users registered on my blood pressure tracking platform, which I created specifically for my hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients (including those in remission or those with a family history who want to stay alert). I’d like to invite you to join the platform as well, because beyond tracking your numbers, it helps guide your habits and gives you a much more accurate understanding of what you’re doing right — and what you’re not. You can even select whether you’re hypertensive or not, and the goals will automatically adjust. The link is in my bio — I’d love for you to check it out later.\n\nMy suggestion for you: maintain the habits you’ve built — the mindset of change is powerful. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, and if possible, always monitor your sleep quality and stress levels. Do physical activities in zone 2 or zone 3, then assess your VO₂ max, always aiming to increase and make it more efficient. This is extremely helpful for achieving a better and more effective reduction in blood pressure.\n\nBut congratulations already on the progress you’ve made!",

If you spike at the doctors due to anxiety, doesn’t matter - just do it at home and record it. The BP that matters is RESTING BP. Having high BP when moving around is totally normal. \n\n2) people don’t like meds because: \n- maybe side effects\n- may prevent you eating/drinking some stuff (grapefruit, alcohol)\n- you’ll have to remember to take them and it’s a bother \n- you have to pay attention not to run out of the meds, plus cost for meds\n- if you want more babies then you probably have to switch to less effective meds for pregnancy \n- it means you have a chronic health condition that is controlled with meds. I think many people want to be “cured”, and not take meds. \n\nIf you are ok with meds for the rest of your life, then I guess you’re fine. \n\nNB: the 120/80 guidelines were for men. So some research suggests it should be even lower for women. But this is still new because duh, most research is done about men. Suggested preliminary guidelines for women (under 40 years) I think is something like 110/70. So I just take this as “don’t worry if meds are working too well” (unless it’s even lower than 100/60 and you get dizzy, which might be too low BP).",

I came here to look for outer opinions on something I have been suffering for a few weeks. About a month ago I had to go to the ER because my BP was at 195/138 P at 150 and being honest this scared me shitless. I don't know what exactly triggered this but my theory is bad eating habits + sedentary life + very bad sleep hygiene .Since then I have been taking Amlodipine 5, HZ 12.5 and Irbersartan 300 and my BP has been consistently low except for my pulse that sometimes is on the low 100s and have been eating better and walking. \n\nNow the thing is, since the episode I get anxiety for EVERYTHING related to doing exercise or getting intimate with my partner, thinking of the worst. I dont know what to do about this especially since I get fatigue sometimes while walking or doing some lifting doing chores at home.\n\nHave someone been through this? Anyone has tips?

I’ve done a LP(a) lab and that came back totally fine, which is great. Did a heart CT, stress test, Holter monitor, checked for renal stenosis, and an echo. All came back great. I work out 5-6 times per week doing both strength and cardio (biking well over 30 miles per week at the gym at a resistance of 7.) I eat well and watch my sodium. Caffeine stays well below 200mg/ day and is fine with my cardiologist. We did a medication adjustment back in March or so after some weird top number readings for a while and since then my readings had been great. The last 3ish weeks I’ve gotten weird bottom number readings and now into top and bottom being weird (mostly mid to high 80s into 90s.) My cardiologist has been out sick as I’ve been keeping in check with them and we even double checked that my monitor is accurate as I take my pressure every day. I’ve managed my medical anxiety and take all my meds as I’m suppose to, take my readings according to AHA standards, and I’ve lost about 18lbs so far. VERY mild sleep apnea to the point I hardly qualify as having it (and they did the test when I was sick so they’re not even sure if I do have it as results may have been skewed.) \n\nIm on 50mg metoprolol er and 60mg nifedipine er/ day (taken in the morning with 24 oz water) and take my reading 2 hours after meds as I’m told to by my doctor yet my readings the last 3 weeks are still abnormally high.\n\nAny ideas on why this might be happening or things I could ask my doctor about to figure this out?\n\nTYA!

Within the past 3 weeks I started to get headaches and decided to take a BP reading with my portable monitor (one that my doctor checked out a few years ago).  The reading was high, as in 175 over 111 high.  I have clonidine to take for when it gets 160 over 100 and I began taking that every 6 hours.  My BP would only go down to the 150 over 90 range but would constantly average 160 over 100.  \n\nI made the earliest appointment for a doctor's visit a week after that.  In between I checked out 3 other blood pressure monitors and they all read pretty much the same thing.  Averaging around 160 over 100 after taking all of my medicine.  It would go as high as 170 over 110 if I went too long in between doses and it was also that high in the morning before I took any medicine.\n\nToday was my doctor's visit.  During the visit we took readings on my portable monitor and on his portable monitor.  Both were 160 over 100.  However, the doctor and the NP both took manual readings and were VERY sure that my BP was actually 130 over 80.  \n\nWhat is going on here?  Why is every portable monitor I'm using showing one thing while manual is showing another?",

    "selftext": "EDIT: This is my question. Does anyone here who is on meds for blood pressure have a prescription that says \"take one tablet a day, but on days that you feel anxious or your BP is reading higher, take two\"? This is how my PCP wants me to manage some recent BP spikes / higher readings. I have never heard of using BP meds that way - I thought the idea was to take the same amount at the same time every day in order to keep the medication consistent in your bloodstream - and I'm trying to decide whether to comply or to get a second opinion from a different doctor. Please share your experience if you have any that relate. Thank you!\n\nTLDR version: First, some background and the story that leads to my post. 62YO female, diagnosed with hypertension in Nov. 2024. PCP started me on 50 mg of daily Losartan-HCTZ at that time. Other than some fluctuating BP readings the first couple of weeks, BP quickly stabilized and my weekly morning readings have been in a consistently good range for the past year: typically, around 110/70 on the average. In addition, I have improved my diet and increased my exercise, losing roughly 20 pounds in the process so that I'm now in the high end of a \"normal\" weight range for my height.\n\nThe story is that everything was going well until a couple of days ago. Out of the blue, while I was sitting quietly and working on the computer, I got a late afternoon nosebleed. Nothing to be alarmed about except I really have \\*never\\* had one, so it did scare me. I leaned forward and pinched the soft part of my nose until the bleeding stopped about 20 minutes later, at which time my husband suggested that I check my blood pressure, having read that a nosebleed + high BP could be a warning sign of artery blockage. My reading was 175/93. Retook in other arm and it was 182/95. Sat quietly for 15 minutes and tried to relax, then retook. Third reading was 181/98.\n\nI didn't like the trend, esp. in the diastolic which was higher than I'd ever seen it, and it was 6 PM on Sunday evening so my PCP was not available, so we decided to go to the ED. In the couple of hours I was there for observation, my BP started to come down. The nurse told us they see this all the time when people become resistant to the dosage of meds they are on and need an adjustment. Granted, also, I was very scared, and I know that was affecting my BP readings. They released me with instructions to follow up with my PCP, which I did yesterday. (By yesterday morning my BP had returned to normal. I've since had a couple more nosebleeds, not accompanied by very high BP like the first time, but still higher than I'm used to.)\n\nWhat this post is about is what my PCP has told me to change: to continue taking one dose of Losartan / day, \\*except\\* on days when I know I'm going to be stressed or I see high BP readings. On those days I should take two doses of Losartan.\n\nHas anyone heard of managing BP this way? I thought the goal was to have a consistent amount of medication in your bloodstream at all times, and wonder if \"some days taking two\" could cause my BP to be more erratic overall and lead to unwanted side effects.\n\nI would love to hear from you if your doctor is managing your BP the way my doctor wants to, or if you know the answer to my question. I've spent the past day trying to find anything to read that supports this idea and have come up empty. At this point I'm just not convinced it is safe to do what my doctor is advising, but I am open to changing my mind.\n\nThanks for reading and for sharing any experience you have in this area.",

        "body": "Look, that’s exactly what you said — most guidelines usually recommend starting medication and observing the patient’s response while they also begin lifestyle changes.  \nJust increasing the dose whenever blood pressure rises isn’t something I’ve ever seen recommended in any guideline, and it overlooks a few important things:\n\n1. Is there a recurring factor that’s preventing proper control, even with the usual medication?\n2. When the patient is making healthy lifestyle changes, is it really necessary to increase the dosage?\n3. Or even… is the patient showing the same blood pressure values when daily habits improve? Or slightly lower readings, even with the regular prescribed dose (just one tablet)?\n\nBlood pressure control involves many details. Simply increasing the number of pills might “work,” but it treats the **numbers**, not the **person**. We have to go beyond that.\n\nThere are a few people here and on Discord using my blood pressure monitoring platform — it actually includes these kinds of details and really helps to understand where adjustments can be made. There’s an English version too, so feel free to use it if you’d like. The link is in my profile.\n\nBut yeah, increasing the dose just because the pressure goes up doesn’t make much sense to me.\n\nTake care!",

Due to my already HBP the Endo didnt want me to do the Salt Test and instead jumped right to taking the Eplerenone.\n\nThe Endos rational was that if I did have Aldosterone glands over producing then the combination of these drugs would see \"near instantaneous\" improvements in my BP.\n\nThoughts about this approach and about taking both drugs at once?\n\n",

You certainly could still have one-sided hyperaldosteronism even without anything showing on the CT scans. Your doctor is right that if you do have hyperaldosterism taking eplerenone should help you immensely and relatively quickly (a few weeks), but then you are stuck on the medicine and any tests that you try to take will be tainted by it, including an adrenal vein sampling which is the gold standard for one-sided hyperaldosteronism isn't that can be treated with surgery. \n\nThe labetalol also can interfere with your renan test which is needed to figure out read and aldosterone ratio. That's probably why your doctor said just try the medicine and see if it helps. You could at least take a 24-hour urine aldosterone before starting. I don't know what you should do.

    "selftext": "Backstory:\nMy husband had a stroke in 2021. His blood pressure during the stroke was extremely high, obviously. He was put on Amlodapine and baby aspirin. Well,about a year ago, his (new) doctor took him off the Amlodapine. For a while, his BP was stable. However, last week, his BP spiked while at work. They sent him home. I was late for work that day and, as soon as I heard what his BP was, I rushed him to the ER. He maxed out at 210/133 and docs couldn't get it down. Turns out, he has resistant hypertension. MRI showed two additional minor strokes that could have been much worse. He's now on 5 BP meds and a low sodium diet.\n\nThe Question:\nThe problem is, he eats like a picky toddler. I can list the vegetables he will eat and he LIVED for processed foods (think frozen meals and food, boxed side dishes, etc.) and fast food. Trust me, I know it's immature, but if he even THINKS that I put a vegetable in his food -- or if a vegetable touched his food during the cooking process -- he will claim he can taste it and he won't eat it. He loves Italian food and meat/potatoes. So, I need some recipes that I can make that ARE NOT BLAND, but also don't include a lot of stuff that he just won't eat.  Below is a list of what he WILL eat:\n\nVegetables:\nIceberg lettuce \nCucumber\nMushrooms\nPotatoes\nGreen Beans\nCorn\n\nMeat:\nChicken\nGround Beef\nSteak\nTuna Fish (RARELY EATS)\nHot Dogs (can't eat now)\nKielbasa (can't eat now)\nSausage (can't eat now)\nHam (can't eat now)\n\nDairy:\nMilk\nCheddar, Mozzarella, Parmesan cheese\nCottage Cheese (RARELY EATS)\nRicotta Cheese\n\nCarbs:\nPasta (and NOT whole wheat, veggie, or protein pasta)\nWhite Bread\nPotato Bread\nRolls (hamburger, hot dog, Kaiser rolls)\nCrescent rolls\n\nIf you have to get a little sneaky with vegetables in your recipes, that's okay! I just want him to get healthy!\n\nBONUS:\nThanksgiving recipes would be great too? Our normal spread consists of candied ham (he won't eat turkey), Parmesan garlic mashed potatoes, Italian style green beans (fresh green beans marinated in Italian dressing), homemade macaroni and cheese, stuffing (he won't eat), and crescent rolls. Any HEALTHY substitution recipes would be AMAZING!!!!\n",

Also I recommend Trader Joe's coffee rub if you have a store nearby.  It's low sodium and does a good job with meats on the grill.\n\nJust my personal thoughts - you have more chance of success if you approach this gradually.  Going cold turkey might be more likely to lead to failure.  For example, I don't worry about the occasional dinner out or holiday.  I still try to make good choices, but too much denial can backfire.  \n\nGood luck.  I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!",

Not disastrous but I've done everything possible to lower manually and these levels were same as before medication.\n\nI had all clear ECG, excellent bloods bar one reading. So nurse put me on 36 hour BP watch to rule out white coat and average was slightly higher. So he upped me to 7.5 for 2 weeks.\n\nPost 2 weeks of 50% and no difference on readings, in fact pulse dropped to 42 from usual 45-48 average. (I am quite fit but not sure I'm that fit!!)\n\nSo referred back to Docs and he put me on double to 10mg Ramipril for a month and booked bloods in 2 weeks to ensure ok, and echo on heart (that's later today). Been on these 7 days now and my BP is now 150/105 so what on Earth is going on. Feel like reverse is happening!\n\nWill update post echo later.\n\nEDIT: Echo went ok. Obviously they couldn't commit as they need to officially measure and write a report but he mentioned off the record nothing to worry about. Thanks for all the replies, think I will suggest a change of medicine to see if that is an option.",

        "body": "I can definitely relate to the stress and uncertainty you're feeling right now. My father went through something similar a few years ago, and I remember how scared and helpless we all felt. The constant worry about his health, the unanswered questions, and that nagging feeling of \"what if\" weighed on us heavily. But thankfully, preventative scanning ended up playing a huge role in his recovery.\n\nHe was in his mid-50s and, like you, started experiencing odd symptoms of chest pain, cold limbs, and general discomfort. He brushed it off at first, thinking it was just stress or fatigue from work. But the symptoms didn’t go away, and after some convincing from our family, he decided to get a heart scan. Thankfully, he did.\n\nThe scan showed that he had a blockage in one of his arteries, something none of us had expected. He wasn’t diagnosed with anything serious yet, but the early discovery of this blockage meant we could act before it became a full-blown heart attack. His doctors were able to start treatment right away, putting him on medication and adjusting his lifestyle to reduce his risks. The whole thing really opened our eyes to how important these preventative tests are, especially when the symptoms are there but nothing seems immediately wrong on the surface.\n\nThe scan was a turning point it helped prevent something much worse from happening. He’s been doing great ever since, and it was all thanks to catching the issue early. Seeing how much a simple scan changed his life has made me more proactive about my own health too.\n\nI hope your results give you the answers and relief you're looking for and just know that you're not alone in this. Early detection can make all the difference!",

It was so intense that I gotten up and ran to get my phone. Called 911 and ended up in the ER all day doing blood work and troponin. Everything's fine. Today same thing but watching TV. Sweating a little bit not sure if it's anxiety or not. I called my cardiologist after hours. Some guy called me back and told me as if I will die and need to go to the ER. Issue is. Ice Strom and nothing I can do and the ambulance wouldn't even take me to the heart hospital. They just take you to the nearest one and mine nearest one is so so unprofessional. From 2 days ago to today 3 days. I still can workout with no issue so I'm not sure what's going on. Had stress echogram. X-ray November and troponin on January 21st and 25th.

        "body": "Definitely recommend asking your doc to confirm. \n\nThe report's mention of a small area of thickening on one part of the aortic valve could be due to mild calcification (a common process where calcium builds up in body tissues, including the heart), it's not significantly affecting the valve's function right now, as indicated by the normal motion.\n\nThe overall context of these findings suggests that there is no significant heart valve dysfunction, and no immediate signs of endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves or the inner lining of the heart. Endocarditis also generally comes with other symptoms, like fever, chills, fatigue, chest discomfort. Assuming you don't have any of these symptoms, that’s likely why no immediate follow-up is required and you've been instructed to return in 6 months to 1 year, just to ensure that there’s no progression of the calcification or other emerging heart issues.\n\nAgain, I would recommend discussing these results in detail with your doctor to get a complete understanding, particularly about why endocarditis was mentioned, and to find out whether there are any specific lifestyle modifications or monitoring that you should follow in the meantime. In general monitoring your BP at home is never a bad idea, since BPs measured in an office are sometimes higher (or less often, lower) than they are at home. \n\n  \nAMA/AHA has good instructions on how to get a good reading: [https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf)",

I am looking for advice from others who are in the same situation or medical professionals. Let me list down my thought process below - \n\nI'm an Indian male, 42 years old. Slightly overweight (5'9\", 83 kgs). Over the last few years I have tried to lead a physically active lifestyle that includes at least 6-7 hours of exercise weekly, including cardio and weight training. My diet mostly comprises of home cooked Indian meals (rice, chappatis, pulses, legumes, and green veggies, with occasional chicken and eggs. I'm also a social drinker (1-2 drinks per week).\n\nI have a family history of heart disease (Both grandfathers, my father, and elder brother (49 years old) have had heart attacks). \n\nI get an annual blood work done and my LDL remains stubbornly high at about 100-120 even though I mostly eat healthy and workout. Triglycerides are below the threshold. Blood pressure is normal. I dont have any other risk factor like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, blood sugar and smoking etc. \n\nI consulted a physician recently after my brother got a heart attack. And he suggested that I immediately get on a daily regimen of statins (10mg). \n\nMy biggest hesitancy about statins is that I dont want to take a drug for the rest of my life if there is no major risk for me. I feel any drug has its short term and long term side effects. For example, statins are known to cause Type 2 diabetes in some patients. I would like to stay away from any such unintended side effects. \n\nI'm sure there are others like me wrestling with this situation. It would be very helpful to hear your point of view and your experience with statins, if any. Thanks!",

I stood up in fear tried to take a deep breath and wash my face and then i got hit by the third one, it felt like being punched by a professional boxer, it knocked me to the ground, for a couple seconds i couldnt hear or see anything, i got up and i was sort of limping bc my legs were really stiff and failing, i went to my girlfriend and said that i needed to go to the hospital right now no questions asked, on the way i could feel my heart rate going through the roof and down the floor within seconds of each other, i honestly tought i was dying. In the hospitol they took my pressure , it was a little high, and did an ecg and it was normal, they pumped me with sedatives and i blacked out and was sent home the following morning when i woke up. \n\nThis happened for 3 days straight, the it stopped. But since it happened it changed me, now on some days when im trying to sleep and am just about to fall asleep i feel a shock/chill on my heart , it feels like my heart stops for a single second. I also get random heart palpitations, chest pains, night sweats,  anxiety and i feel very tired. If i consume an above average amount of alcohol my heart goes into afib on the next day. If a have an adrenaline rush i feel a very sharp pain in my chest and if i drink any amount of caffeine i have arrhythmia.\n\nI've been to a cardiologist who did exams and said everythign was fine with my heart.\n\nI've been to a shrink who said it was a panic disorder and gave me an anxiolytic prescription, but im not convinced.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Should i got to another heart doctor? Should i go to a neurologist? I'll appreaciate any input, this is deteriorating my life quality as time goes by and idk what to do",

It truly felt like it was eminating from my stomach and somehow the EKG in the ER did not show it as heart related. They gave me stomach meds and pain killers and sent me home. My primary care doctor figured out what was going on when he did an EKG and results clearly said HEART ATTACK.\n\nRegards and feel better",

This is what you should expect:\n\nYou may get prescribed something for your anxiety. I'd recommend trying a little bit of it before the day of the test so you can see how you handle it. You have to be aware enough to hold your breath during certain times.\n\nYou will go in, get changed, and they will put an IV in your arm. They will likely inject you with a liquid beta blocker because your HR needs to be 60 bpm or less for the test. They may inject you with it up to three times if your HR is stubborn.\n\nThey will test out the contrast by injecting a little bit to see if you're allergic. Tell them if you have any side effects.\n\nThey will take pictures without contrast. Then they will have you take a medication orally to dialte your veins. Then they will inject the contrast into your IV. You should tell them if you feel funny after it but you probably will feel fine. You may think you've peed yourself after the injection.\n\nYou must stay completely still as they are doing the test or else you can mess up the images. You literally can't even move a finger or toe.\n\nThe entire test will be pretty short. Then you probably shouldn't drive. In my experience the beta blocker and anti-anxiety med combo really messed me up.",

Usually they go away within a couple of minutes but I did have one bad episode where my heart didn't beat right for a whole evening and didn't get back to normal until I'd been to sleep. In hindsight I should have gone to hospital but I was in denial about what was going on.\n\nI managed to catch the latest occurrence on my fitbit charge 5. I think the really big peaks are from where I wasn't sat still enough but you can see extra beats around 6s and 14s and other places.\n\nOther symptoms I have is heavy lifting causes chest pains (angina?) and spasm like feelings around my heart (but they don't show up on ECG). If I've had a bad day I often feel like my heart is beating quite hard (but not fast) when I'm at rest, to the point where lying on my left side or front when trying to sleep isn't possible as I can feel my heart beating so much. Jogging and hiking feel good though and don't seem to worsen it. \n\nI've seen doc and cardiologists blood tests and ECG done and they say they can't pick anything up. Not had echocardiagram yet, then that's next step. This has been going on for a couple of months and I would love to know what's wrong with me",

He sent me for testing at my local cardiac clinic. I did a Holter monitor overnight and stress test. All results came back negative. All good, clean bill of health.\n\nFast forward to just over a month ago. I noticed that I was getting this weird \"ploomf\" sensation in my chest very occasionally instead of a normal heartbeat. I don't know how to describe it--sort of an odd feeling, like the heart did not beat 100% correctly for that moment. It wasn't a series of weird heartbeats in quick succession or anything like that...just, every now and then, I'd notice this odd \"off\" heartbeat for a moment. As if I was having a weird kind of palpitation. When it happens, I can literally feel it beat slightly \"weird\" if I have my hand placed on my chest over my heart.\n\nMy memory could be wrong, but I feel like I remember having this happen in the past, many years ago, and it would go away of its own accord pretty quickly.\n\nAnyway, back to the present: it persisted for a couple of weeks, then went away for a week, then came back again. I decided to go to the doctor (a different one; my previous one had moved away). He sent me for blood work and an EKG. Both came back negative. I only found out because I hadn't heard back for a week since the tests, so I phoned in.\n\nSometimes I notice this weird heartbeat more often, like a few times an hour or even a few times every 10 minutes. Other times, I don't notice it for long periods of time. And sometimes, usually when I'm engrossed in something else, I don't notice it at all.\n\nSo I'm just wondering what's going on. I'll be following up with this doctor, but do you folks have any advice or suggestions in the meantime as to what might be going on?",

IT'S THEIR JOB, so don't let them pass you off to another doctor.\n\nWhen I was having my first heart attack in 2009, my chest felt like it was being crushed by a bulldozer, but all my tests kept coming back negative so the doctor tried to tell me I had acid reflux. I kept telling him no to the point of standing toe to toe screaming at each other until he finally relented and sent me to get an angiogram. They were, of course, shocked to find a 95% blockage in my LAD, which is affectionately referred to as \"the widow maker\" in their world.\n\nHeart attacks are all about blocked coronary arteries. ECG's and EKG's don't detect blockages, they detect heart function anomalies that *might* indicate blockages, but just because they don't indicate any issues doesn't definitively mean there aren't any. Same with coronary sonograms. Chest x-rays can be helpful, but chemical and/or treadmill stress tests are better.\n\nA troponin test only indicates whether you have elevated levels of that heart enzyme in your blood stream from a heart attack that caused actual damage. However, angina hurts as bad as a heart attack -- and can eventually lead to having a big one -- but it doesn't often cause damage on its own so there wouldn't be any elevated troponin enzyme levels. A negative troponin test means there wasn't any damage -- yet -- it doesn't mean there aren't any serious blockages causing the pain.\n\nAfter 12 years and 8 stents, the only definitive test I know of is an angiogram. It hurts, its invasive and it's expensive, so maybe it might not be warranted if every other test comes back negative. But if antacids or the Purple Pill don't work for your acid reflux, it might be worth taking a look.\n\nYou mentioned you \"woke up\" with a burning sensation, and laying down can worsen acid reflux so maybe it is that.

I've been sick with a sinus infection and sore throat for about 2 weeks now. The other day I noticed when I would blow my nose, I could smell ammonia. When I looked it up, all signs pointed to kidney issues. I stopped drinking and have had no withdrawal. My overall feeling, health wise, is usually decent. Nothing noticeable. I finally broke down and went to the doctor to get some antibiotics for my sinus infection. My blood pressure initially showed 180/140. They waited a few minutes and checked again and it was 161/121. I am aware this is no good... How far have I potentially damaged my body? Can I turn this ship around by changing my exercise, eating, and drinking habits?

The advancements in medical science have immensely benefitted patients in many ways, minimally invasive cardiac surgery being one of them.\n\nMinimally invasive cardiac surgeries are performed using small incisions. But to understand the procedure, it is helpful to compare it with open-heart surgery. In open-heart surgery, the breastbone is cut, which means the incision is much larger. For a long time, open-heart surgery was the only option for patients with severe cardiac problems. However, the advent of **minimally invasive cardiac surgery** has changed that completely.\n\nRead More: [https://gktiyer.blogspot.com/2023/01/what-is-minimally-invasive-cardiac.html](https://gktiyer.blogspot.com/2023/01/what-is-minimally-invasive-cardiac.html)",

(9000 mg/dl ) normal reference number is (0-40 mgdl).\nImmediately angiography done and it revealed 95% RCA blockage. 2 stents have been placed via angioplasty and he is doing fine now. I guess it's genetic ( i have higher lipoprotein A, currently taking niacin/ b3 for it, there's no other treatments for it as of now here ).",

It skipped my father‘s generation, but his mother and her father had major issues with heart disease. My grandmother had a heart attack at 40. If you’re aware of this heredity factor you should most definitely see a cardiologist. \n\nI was diagnosed after having what I thought was a heart attack and having to visit the ER.   I was only 38 and I’m an average weight, seemingly healthy female. I’m just thankful that they took me seriously. As a younger woman you get dismissed a lot when it comes to your concerns. \n\nI was given a CT scan with contrast. They also gave me medication to slow my heart while they did the CT scan so they could see better. I was also given an echo. I have to say it is pretty neat to watch your own heartbeat during the echo. Thankfully it has been caught early and I was put on something for my cholesterol and my high blood pressure. Later I was sent to the cardiologist and I was given a stress test, which thankfully I passed. Catch it early and hopefully you can keep it in check. Putting it off only makes things worse.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a man, 29 years old. 170 cm, 55 kg. I have a chronic kidney disease (glomerulonephritis, stage 3). I control my blood pressure with Perindopril. Have never been overweight, but I’m not fit at all either.\n\nIn March 2021 I had a terrible headache, chest pain, higher blood pressure than usual and difficulty focusing my eyesight (I couldn’t read). This episode lasted for a couple days, and ever since it went away, I had these symptoms:\n\n* Constant chest tightness and chest discomfort, primarily on the left side. It feels like something is squeezing my chest.\n* Constant shortness of breath and inability to take a satisfying breath. Feeling that something in the chest doesn’t open up and air doesn’t reach where it is supposed to go. Breathing feels shallow. I cannot even breathe in enough air to talk and get out of breath all the time when speaking.\n* Very frequent, almost constant, chest pain. The pain is usually right under my left breast, where I can feel the heartbeat. It feels like intense squeezing or pressure. I wake up with this pain in the morning quite often and have it for days. I can’t seem to pinpoint what triggers it.\n* Palpitations, not very frequent\n* Strong heartbeat, feeling of pulsation in the body\n* Dizziness, brain fog, tiredness\n\nI experience chest tightness and difficulty breathing literally **all the time**, they never subside. I tried daily jogging during the summer and the autumn, and the pain doesn’t necessarily come during or right after training (although that can happen too). I don’t know if there is a direct connection between the pain and physical exertion.\n\nAt this point I have done these tests, some of them multiple times:\n\n* Blood and urine test: don’t show anything except for my kidney disease\n* Spirometry: shows reduction in lungs volume. Asthma medicines give no improvements.\n* Chest X-rays: everything is ok\n* Electrocardiography: everything is ok\n* Echocardiogram: everything is ok\n* Heart CT scan: showed a slight incipient atherosclerosis in left anterior descending artery, but my doctor says it shouldn’t give symptoms like these.\n* Gastroscopy: esophagus is fine.\n* Threadmill: according to the doctor, the test shows that everything is ok, but I get tired and out of breath during running very quickly. \n\nI have used three different asthma inhalers for half a year without any effect. I get heartburn quite often, and medicines against that help, but they don’t improve shortness of breath or chest pain at all. After CT scan detected slight atherosclerosis, I started taking Atorvastatin.\n\nI don’t hyperventilate. I breathe at a normal rate, but the feeling of air hunger is always there. Sometimes I intentionally take a deeper breath. It can be successful and air hunger subsides for a moment, or it feels like my chest doesn’t increase in volume after specific point and I don’t get a satisfying breath. Oximeter shows normal oxygen saturation of the blood (even during jogging).\n\nSome doctors I’ve encountered suggest that this is psychological issue, but I don’t think so because a) I’ve never experienced any panic attacks or similar before, b) it doesn’t explain the starting episode and c) it doesn’t feel connected to my psychological state.\n\nI am vaccinated against corona.\n\nAll in all, doctors claim my heart is ok, but I am not sure about it. Asthma inhalers don’t help. Majority of the symptoms are there 24/7, without changing much for better or worse during more than a year. I have been to ER a bunch of times, and my doctors have no idea what this could be.\n\nIs anyone here been in a similar situation? What can I do? This feels like this is a heart issue, but I don’t know. Shouldn’t CT rule it out? Can it happen that CT doesn’t pick up any conditions, bur MRI does it? Should I insist on getting MRI? Are there other tests I should do?",

        "body": "I had a lot of the same symptoms as you back in 2019.  I'm 53 and started experiencing heart symptoms when I was 49.  I had a nasty viral infection probably from March through July of 2019.  Not COVID-19, as this was 1 year before COVID-19 hit the U.S.  I went to the doctor several times and one time they did some sort of viral assay and said \"well, not the flu, but its viral\" type of answer.  It was a respiratory infection with horrible coughing, and just about everything else you can imagine that goes with a respiratory infection.\n\nIn July 2019 it cleared up.\n\nAnd then about mid-August 2019 I started getting symptoms of \"puffiness\" and my chest started, very slowly, getting a bit tighter and tighter.  No pain though.  After about 3-4 weeks of this, I went to a hospital and stayed overnight.  The viral illness that I had was causing some type of quickly progressing congestive heart failure and I was experiencing a high level of water retention in my body (leg was starting to poof up a bit).  A diuretic cleared that up right away.  I was released the next day although they couldn't figure out why my standing heart rate was about 120 bpm.\n\nThey did a cath procedure within a few days and they couldn't see or visualize anything that was blocked.  They did lots of other tests as well.  My ejection fraction from my left ventricle was low, like 20%, so they knew I had some type of congestive heart failure.\n\nThey put me on several meds that were switched around a few times over the next couple of months.  I don't want to say I'm \"cured\" but the meds saved my life - stabilized me, and improved my heart function somewhat.  I haven't need a pacemaker (there's a certain type of pacemaker that is usually recommended for people that have a low ejection fracture).  The meds I'm on now have mostly stayed the same since the beginning of 2020.\n\nRight now, my ejection fracture has stabilized at 35-40%.  Not the best, but I get tested about every 6-12 months and its been good for 3 years at this level.  I don't have tightness, or having a feeling of being winded.  I haven't gotten back to my usual exercise regimen, but I can go on fast walks and easy/moderate hikes and feel fine.",

    "selftext": "Let me preface this by explaining what I’ve been going through for the past ~2 months or so\n\nBack in early October I was visiting my boyfriend in Michigan and since it’s a state where weed is legal we decided to give some a try. I hadn’t done it since college so it had been a few years, and I’m assuming I just did too much too fast because it triggered a panic attack. Ambulance was called and they told me I just needed to go back inside and relax so that’s what I did. The panic attack eventually subsided and everything was all good. \n\nHowever, that panic attack absolutely scared the FUCK out of me and during it I legitimately thought I was going to die because I had never experienced anything like that before. Ever since then I’ve had extreme health anxiety relating to my heart and I’m overly aware of almost every beat, constantly freaking about whether or not I’m having a heart attack or some other episode. This has led me to get multiple EKGs, all of which turned up completely normal. This wasn’t enough to convince me however, so my PCP set up an appointment with a cardiologist to have an echo done. \n\nFast forward to this past Friday, I visit the cardiologist and they start me off by putting a 24 hour Holter on me before the echo. So I put the Holter on, wait a day, and come back for the echo. \n\nAfter the echo I am told my heart is structurally perfect (which is GREAT news for my anxious mind) however they tell me my heart rate spiked multiple times that night with the Holter on, all while I was asleep. The cardiologist suspects this is SVT and prescribed beta blockers which I started taking tonight. \n\nThe reason why I’m skeptical is because of it was SVT wouldn’t I also be having episodes while I’m awake? I have never had any episodes of a spiked heart rate since the panic attack so this comes as such a shock to me. Is it possible that I am just so stressed about my health that I am just having anxiety attacks in my sleep instead of it being SVT? Or is there a possibility of it being something else?",

    "selftext": "\n\nSo basically at one point in my life I was extremely obsessed with losing weight and just having a general addiction to the gym. One day I idiotically decided to take a fat burning supplement that contained a herb called ephedra which contains ephedrine. The first day I took it I immediately felt extreme cold sweats and a fast paced heart rate yet it seemed to wear off around 10 mins later so I shrugged it off and seemed it to be anxiety related as I was already anxious to take the pill. The next time I took it was a couple of days later at half the dosage and everything seemed fine at first until towards the end of my workout when everything went wrong. While walking on the treadmill I felt the sensation of my heart dropping to my stomach and immediately got very cold and a very fast heart rate. I tried to calm myself down as my friend has been taking the full dosage for around a week now with no symptoms. My symptoms seemed to not go away as panic set in for me and I began to realize I needed medical attention. I was rushed to the nearest hospital and described what I took. They did a ECG and a blood test for Troponin however both seemed normal and I was sent back home. I was extremely nauseous and on edge yet nothing too serious. The next day towards the night I got the same similar heart drop feeling and was rushed again just to have all tests seem normal again. The doctor stated that I was an adverse reaction to the herb and my body was trying to get rid of it by sweating it out. The next couple\nOf days I felt horrible and couldn’t get myself to eat I was shaky and nauseous. I booked an appointment with a cardiologist and did every test possible. The echo came back seemingly normal yet with an extremely low amount of LVH (left ventricle hypertrophy) deemed within the normal range by other doctors. I still felt palpations and a weird heart rate so we did a holster test a couple days later just for it to also come back normal. The doctor claimed I was healthy and fine and just to relax and take the medications he asked me to. I was given concor (beta blocker) with a 1.25mg daily dose (very small) and anti depressants just for my anxiety. Things seemed to get better however I was still scarred to death reading about all the adverse affect people my age would experience such as sudden death and permanent disabilities. I would also experience small chest pinches and chest pain for a couple of seconds that didn’t get worse with breathing or laying down. Weeks later everything seemed to be going back to normal however caffine and nicotine would\nMake me a bit anxious yet I seemed fine this lasted a month or two. Towards that time I began my first year of uni and traveled overseas. During my time there everything was fine and I was extremely happy with going back to my normal life yet a couples of weeks later I got this huge sense of dizziness that seemed life threading sort of. This dizziness would only be resolved by making myself full or eating consistently yet I still experienced a crazy amount of brain fog. I scared myself with some more research and found that the anti-depressant I was taking (escitalopram, cipralix) has a small chance of causing arrhythmias and QT wave prolongnations in the heart. I spoke to my doctor about this and he said that I could stop taking it if I wanted to and everything seemed fine so I tried stopping. After doing so I would take it every two days or so to slowly stop the dose but once I took it I would get the same heart dropping cold sweat feeling I got beforehand and I could never take it again since then. I got severe depression for a while just randomly crying for no reason but the faded away. Doctor also noted that since all tests were negative there was no reason for me to take concor anymore except if I felt anxious. after stopping all of my meds, I started getting this chest pain and extreme anxiety again and with my parents across the sea I started to panic. I eneded up losing a term of university and going back home to run some medical tests and be near my parents for the time. I was at the worst state of my life always crying and feel chest pain accompanied by regular symtomps of heart attacks such as back in pain and pain in arms however they would come and go as they please and sometimes separate from each other. I begged for another echocardiogram and had another one done which I sent to several cardiologist and they all deemed my symomtps to be anxiety related and they stated that’s several teenagers are reporting similar chest pains after the vaccine with no explanation. The last thing we could have possibly checked was my arteries and I did a CT coronary scan with a contrast dye. Everything once again seemed normal and there were no signs of any inflammation. Yet the chest pain and occasional Dizziness still remained and I was sick of hearing that it was anxiety based. I also had somewhat above high average creatinine levels (accompanied by kidney pain) however after drinking a good amount of water my levels went down from 1.19 to 0.97. Now I have no idea what to do. I always fear the chance that doctors may have misdiagnosed me and I have a huge constant fear for my health. I know I am very young for this to happen but the fact that I took the supplements is causing me to think that this has something to do with it. A doctor told me that since I took the pill months ago and done all the related tests it would be too late for something new to occur since then. I realized that a lot of this happend after I stopped my anti-depressant but now I am horrified of taking any SSRI’s because of their potential heart risks and I still fear something very wrong is happening. I have been prescribed a new different type of beta blocker called propanol for anxiety and rescued heart rate but it’s giving me this sense of my heart burning and after I take it I find it hard to breathe for a couple minutes before it goes away. What do you guys think? I have not been able to live normally in forever and always panic and overthink that I may suddenly die the next day. \n\nFor general information I am 18 years old and used to be very athletic. I took the pill in august and it’s now december. I she  ran these tests throughout the months since.",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit\n\nWouldn't normally go to a forum for medical advice but I'm a bit stumped as to what is wrong with me and what best course of action is.\n\nI'm 36 and, to my knowledge, fit and healthy however have a history of recreational drug use, particularly relevant being ketamine and cocaine. I don't smoke and I'm not an especially heavy drinker.\n\n2 months or so ago I noticed I was getting irregular heart beats when doing intense exercise and when partying. They went away quickly and I didn't dwell on it. However I had one 'episode' where it lasted a whole evening which was quite scary. My heart wasn't going especially fast, just skipping beats and it felt very floppy or loose, and generally seemed weak. I should have gone to hospital in hindsight but went to bed and it went back to normal next day, however I had a tight strained feeling in my chest for days afterwards. This feeling seems to improve when I exercise (although being careful not to push myself too hard).\n\nIt went away and I felt normal then I got irregular beats again doing weights. This time they went away quite fast but the strained feeling came back that day and stayed with me 10 days or so, improving each day. It's a 3 out of 10 in terms of pain/discomfort but definitely noticeable. Top left side of chest. \n\nI've been to doctor and also cardiologist. ECG came back fine but of course if they don't catch the arrhythmia in action then it's tricky. I had blood tests and they listened to my heart and they said all seems fine. However something is clearly wrong here.\n\nIt feels like controlled cardio is good for it and the threshold for which it flips in to arrhythmia can be built up if I keep exercising. But if I push it too hard it comes back and then it seems to come back more easily.\n\nI'm worried that these irregular beats and weakening of damaging my heart. Neither doctor was able to explain the strained feeling and almost insinuating it's in my head. What I'm feeling is not in my head, it's way to pronounced and there's definitely a correlation between it and the irregular beats.\n\nI've bought a fitbit charge 5 and hoping to catch the irregular beats next time they happen. But I also don't want to make them happen as I suffer for days afterwards. I believe the doctor is going to get me one I can wear for 24 hours but same issue, need the irregular bears to occur in that time frame.\n\nMy current plan is to keep exercising and go with my intuition and build up resilience and try and make it go away if that's even possible. \n\nI'd love to know if anyone has had a similar experience.\n\nFor the record I've not taken any drugs since it became apparent this is potentially serious and I'm drinking very little alcohol, a couple of small drinks a week, if that.",

    "selftext": "I'm a female 30 years old. I pretty suddenly about 5 years ago started getting these extremely fast heart racing episodes (thought it was panic attacks induced from smoking pot, because it started happening everytime I smoked, even though I was a long time 10+ years  pot smoker at that point and never had SVT episodes before) and around the same time I actually suffered a concussion. This concussion was also misdiagnosed at first as panic attacks/ anxiety, even psychosis (I thought I was going crazy, feelings I had was never like anything I've felt before and they really sucked, I even quit my job at the time because I just couldn't even see straight) until I convinced a Dr to give me an MRI and CT scan of my brain, which resulted in evidence my brain was healing from a concussion, a week and a half after the fact. During the concussion my svt episodes became worse (still thought it was anxiety/panic attacks so didn't call 911) but I was able to get them to stop after learning how to on my own (bearing down/trying to take deep breaths and holding them slightly) until it became harder and harder to rid them. After 2 1/2 weeks, I woke up one day finally feeling normal out of nowhere. It was like a miracle. Except svt episodes still occured. Still thinking it was just panic attacks, I thought really nothing of it.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got an episode I couldn't stop. This scared me so much, I was in svt for about 30 mins and called EMT, telling them I couldn't get my \"heart palpitations\" to stop. I originally thought they were heart palpitations caused by anxiety (cause that's what they always told me) until the EKG of 230 bpm proved otherwise and paramedics said I'll probably have to be on heart meds or have ablation. This is where I learned svt was even a thing. They had to shoot me with adenasine 3 times to get it to stop (6mg, 12mg and 12mg) and that was so dreadfully scary, but also relieved when it stopped... Weirdest feeling ever. They asked if I had a history of anxiety, which I do, and said this is why it was misdiagnosed for years. \n\nI realize now I've had countless episodes. It used to be a few times a week, sometimes I'd go a week or 2 without episodes, but never a full month I don't think. I guesstimate about 50+ svt attacks in the last 5 years. It got to the point where I can't do any cardio excersize without an episode. Chest pains that I thought was anxiety, was probably angina this whole time, and it's happened a lot. \n\nI'm seeing a cardiologist for my first time on the 13th (soonest appt I can get thanks Kaiser) and my primary put me on propranolol 10mg twice a day and still get flutters almost everyday. Thinking about taking it three times a day now. I was 3 weeks without an episode until the other night, caused by me simply riding my shopping cart to my car like a skateboard (I know silly something I've always done tho) and it's crazy that just that short and very little of excersize was enough to set it off. I didn't have my medication on me, and home was 30 mins away, and even tho I wasn't really in full svt, perhaps from the propranolol (maybe 150 bpm as opposed to 230 bpm that was recorded on EKG before) I was still about to have a bout and my anxiety was thru the roof. I took my propranolol as soon as I got thru the door and called 911, and thankfully it subsided as the paramedics got to me. They did an EKG to make sure (I was at 98bpm but irregular beat) and 10 minutes later I was back to regular heartbeat and 80 bpm, blood pressure was a bit high though (140/something)\n\nI quit cigs (smoked since I was 17), pot (smoked since I was 15) and even coffee, I used to drink about 2 cups everyday for years. I pretty much quit all cold turkey just from being scared of SVT. My grandma died at 68 of a heart attack (probably from smoking cigs, which did a toll her to after she beat breast cancer not long before I'm sure) and my dad died 2 1/2 years ago from a heart attack as well, but he didn't smoke cigs for more than 10 years of his life (quit when he was 30), he was 59 when he died. He was a chronic pot smoker his whole life however and hbp but refused to take meds (as a pharmacy tech now, I'm mad at myself for not making him take his meds, as they might have saved his life).\n\nI don't know if I'm just ranting at this point, or really want to try and find someone I can relate with on this matter and if my heart might heal. Will I ever dance again? I love dancing but I'm so afraid of SVT now. Will ablation be my only option? I actually really want it, the propranolol gives me horrible vivid dreams every single night, but will doctor just keep trying different meds until I don't get episodes anymore? The thing is, I don't wan to \"wait and see\", I want ablation more than meds but afraid doctor will just try everything before ablation is on the table. Is having 50+ svt episodes enough to consider me for ablation? I know most say svt is benign but I'm afraid it's not in me... My heart feels weaker than ever and I'm only 30. Has anyone had this many episodes and are fine now? I really need to know...\n\nEdit March 10 2023 (original post was I believe mid-end November 2022: since I've had a few people ask I should let everyone know I actually ended up getting heart ablation on February 7th 2023. It was a very weird and nerve-wracking operation since you're awake, but they sedated me enough to feel less nervous. You do feel burning in your chest when they do the ablation (in my case multiple times to get the whole spot) but it was bearable. They had to go in both my groin vessels in my case, I guess mine was a hard to reach spot or \"tricky\" as the doctor put it. I was on metoprolol for about 2 months (switched from propranolol after I saw my cardiologist after I posted this), from when I was officially diagnosed to my ablation, and although it did help I did have 2 episodes in those months but I was able to get them to stop after taking an extra dose of metoprolol, although it took about 15-20 minutes for it to kick in and stop it. I got my echocardiogram and ablation appointment set the same day I saw my cardiologist, they basically recommended it right away because of how many episodes I have had. Even though Kaiser is usually a slow process I'm very happy I went from diagnosed to ablation in just about 3 months with only 2 episodes in between. It's now been a little over a month since the ablation and I'm happy to say I'm SVT free, besides the few 1 second flutters but that's apparently totally normal as the heart tissue heals, and those are happening less often now. I stopped taking the metoprolol after the ablation, per doctors orders, probably to see if the ablation actually worked. It's so nice to not have an episode for a month and I'm rly grateful I did it. It did cost me about 6k in the end from my deductible but the whole operation alone is about 30k, at least with Kaiser, but for me is totally worth it as I'm just so relieved now. Fingers crossed cause they do say the heart tissue healing takes about 3 months, so I'm still in what they call a \"blanking\" period to see if it was successful or not. But I'm already getting the feeling it worked, like they say it does about 90-95% of the time. Hope this helps someone who is also looking into ablation, especially if you had like 2-5 episodes a month like I did, I would recommend it.\n\nEdit May 2023: still SVT free and I feel great. Gotta say my anxiety has since gotten better also, before I would never have gone 3 months without an episode since 2018 when it first started happening, even tho I thought they were panic attacks back then. I feel like I'm free again to do whatever I want and go wherever without the fear of having an episode and being pumped with adenosine again. I still get the once in a while flutter but it only happens for a beat, and then it's like the ablation completely keeps the SVT from happening. I strongly recommend ablation if SVT controls your life and medication isn't working as good as it used to.",

The machine at the doctor's office could not read higher than 250, so I don't know how high it actually was. I was put on a cocktail of medication that I take 4 times a day.\n\nI feel like a shell of myself now. My medication causes confusion, memory loss, my reflexes are slower making it harder to drive. I have dark skin under my eyes, regardless of how much I sleep. I get cold in my extremities, sometimes it hurts. And most recently, the past week I have had non-stop indigestion in my upper stomach/esophagus area. Indigestion is a symptom of heart attack in some women, so it has me worried.\n\nI have similar feelings as you and in my mind I assume I will die in my 50's of heart failure, like so many of my family members before me. I'm doing my best to try to live what decent life I can for myself. It may seem morbid to some but it's what helps me cope with my eventual death. I have no idea what major thing I want to do with my life before I die, but I just don't want to suffer while I live.",

Its actually 4:00 am now as my body won't let me sleep. Little embarrassing but Its been 3 days since I used a laser comb for a few minutes to treat my hairloss. My heart always responds this way if I try the laser comb or minoxidil, even in super low dose. I had an echo done a few years ago and I had mild valve leakage, mild wall thickening in right ventricle, mild enlarged right ventricle and a couple other mild type things. I don't smoke and am slender. I get fatigued very easily when my heart acts up like this and I can't sleep. Doctor wants me to get another echo and I'm sure the symptoms will fade by the time the appointment arises. Should I use the laser comb the day before testing to show what occurs when I use it? I dont think its a normal response that my heart gives to these things. Or should I abstain from it and run the risk of my cardiologist saying to do nothing as I have a bunch of mild things going on? Thanks any feedbackbos most appreciated!",

I too have had stomach issues. Usually acid reflux and heart palpations. But i noticed my acid reflux completely went away when i controlled my anxiety. I still get pains on my left side of my chest sometimes that come on for a few seconds then go away which makes me check my blood pressure and i usually find it around 140/80, as I calm down my blood pressure drops. I say all of this to tell you to trust the doctors. im not sure what tests they have done but if they checked you out then you need to trust them and relax. If you go for a run and notice chest pains or shortness of breath then i would be concerned but if your only getting these issues at rest and not when working out i dont see how it could be heart related. I take zoloft and find it calms my mind but i still struggle with health anxiety. heart palpations also scare me but every test they have done on me has came back clean also. its a daily battle but know your not alone and just take a deep breath and try and relax. heart issues do not come and go a bad heart would give you issues when you are working out and you would have symptoms all the time. sweaty palms, palpations, stomach issues can all be caused by anxiety. give the medication time to kick in and see how you feel in a few months. im not a doctor tho so please dont take my advice as such but if the doctors are telling you you are fine then you probably are. if you are really worried about it see if they will do a calcium score test and that can see if you have blockage in your heart or not. i wish the best for you and kow your not alone.",

In fact, some health conditions may be passed down from one generation to the next. It's important to be aware of this so that you can take steps to protect your overall well-being. \n\nWhen diagnosing an illness, one of the first things that doctors will do is study the family health history in order to get a better understanding of the condition and what may have caused it. The heart is not only the center of emotions but also an indicator of the kind of health that has been passed down from your ancestors. There are many reasons for heart disease, including chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels, as well as intense stress levels.

Are you happening to eat a big or fatty meal and then laying down? That can definitely cause GERD, and people go to the ER all the time suspecting a heart attack, when it's just heartburn.\n\nAn EKG isn't going to reveal heart disease, and the blood test you took was likely to test if you had a heart attack, by looking at your troponin levels.\n\nHowever, what they do reveal (in relation to heart disease) is your risk level. They would've told you if you were at high risk for heart disease. Your troponin levels would have been elevated enough to show that, and the EKG would reveal heart arrhythmia. Trust the doctors in that you're likely just fine, at least for right now. \n\nHowever:\n\nI have very early stage heart disease, and I'm 44, in probably the best shape of my life. My primary care doc said I was fine. I kept pushing and they did more tests and ordered an ultrasound done to check blood flow. Everything came back completely normal. My dad introduced me to his cardiologist and they did a stress test on me, which revealed something. So they did a CT scan with that contrast dye stuff and confirmed what was suspected. \n\nWhat's comforting to me is knowing that mine is completely genetic. My cardiologist said there's nothing I did (or can do) to cause this. I'm fit, I go mountain biking, my blood pressure and heart rate are really good, and I'm at the gym usually 5x/week. I eat a healthyish diet; I don't do fried or greasy/fatty foods at all, but I do have a sweet tooth.",

The only information i have ever, at all learned and honestly shocked to learn about my condition and heart desease was through my on reading and discovered through Google. A follow up appointment approximately three weeks after my cath. lasted about 4 minutes, he asked did i have anymore angina attacks ( i had a few) and simply said take my neds and he would see me again in six months. No guidance, no explanation of my condition, nothing. I had already read up on the basics and didnt ask any relevant questions as going in thought it would be explained in full. I think ive been to worried and scared to. My knowledge of heart desease was basically zero although its in my family, but for whatever uneducated, unknown reason i never thought it would happen to me. Its a shock, its scary, and life changing. I still get angina attacks, about 4 a week and the only way i know how to describe them is that it starts with pain in the back if my left upper arm, sometimes in my jaw and mouth and chest. A raw, hard , fatigue like sickness overwhelms me that last anywhere 2-3 minutes it seems and then i feel a relieved rush type feeling as i guess the blood releases, and its over. Its a very sick, scary, debilitating feeling and one thats dreaded when they occur. I am  improving  my diet, my exercises are limited as ive recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my knees, my  right knee is unbearable at times, however thru a vitamin supplement that helps with inflammation and Tylenol im able to limp around for short periods of times. The left is not near as bad but know it's only a matter of time. Staying active and being able to exercise properly is a must i know, but this limits me tremendously. I do walk through the pain as best i can, but dont think its enough. A knee replacement im sure is coming. I am considering seeing a nutritionist as both deseases require a proper diet. Apologies for skipping around, just needed to post this and curious how others with angina and learning of there heart desease, how are you coping, what are your thoughts, feelings, advice?. If i sound like im feeling sorry for myself, im not, im a little out of sorts and scared a little, but its not a pity party, only a big surprise for lack of a better word. I am also surprised this sub doesn't get the numbers, with heart desease so common, who knows i guess. Thanks for reading, hope its helps someone and hope to hear your story. Take care!",

The workload is the same, but i don't have to deal with research on top, and i will have broader clinical skills compared to being more specialized in the long run. Not to mention that academic institutions are more competitive for basically anything, it might take longer in the long-run to learn the same skills, albeit a bit on more specialized cases/experience.",

Some of this will depend on hospital culture, eg if you are doing a lot of bread and butter Afib consults or if gen cards fields some of those.\n\nLifestyle is usually good, definitely better than interventional. Some hospitals may have you take a fair amount of general cardiology call - YMMV.\n\nMain thing I dislike is ambulatory call (when the Holter people call you that someone has rate controlled Afib at 3am….) - calls like this will depend on your hospital setup though.\n\nWouldn’t do anything else.

Meeting the COCATS II requirements would take several months away from my EP training, limiting my exposure compared to others on the 3+2 track.\n\nMost general cardiologists I’ve spoken with recommend getting the echo board, while all EP attendings and EP fellows I’ve talked to think it’s not worth the time and effort. However, that maybe because I’m at an academic institution where EP doctors typically don’t read echos or perform TEEs. Both sides make good points, so I’d love to hear others’ perspectives—especially from those who have faced this decision before.\n\nFor those who obtained the echo board and went into EP—was it beneficial in the long run? Would you recommend getting it?\n\nFor those who did **not** get the echo board and pursued EP— do you feel it wasn’t worth the significant time and effort required?\n\n  \nDeeply appreciate your input!",

Let the JR kind of … find its way after a little torque. And hey, if it’s not working out, just shoot a puff of contrast. If anterior take off switch to a 3drc and if low anterior consider an AR Cath. For JL, have good wire looped in the right coronary cusp before bringing down JL to just below RCC —  will help orient the catheter. Pull back wire to secondary curve and gently torque &gt;&gt; gently pull til you see the jump into left. Take wire up, connect pressure / con, and then can tweak. Low threshold to go to JL4 if tall, old, or obviously catheter is poorly engaging. \n\nEventually you won’t feel “pressured” or think you can’t engage bc you’re deficient (the anatomy can be a pain in the ass sometimes - switch your goddamn catheter). and that’s when it’ll click.

Non-invasive card is more likely to work more years than procedural cards. Back pain and physical and emotional stress can take a toll on your body after many years. If you decide at any point that you don't want to do procedures anymore, your chances of being able to find a non-invasive job are much higher if you're still credentialed and skilled in doing non-invasive work. As an EP, your value is in the EP lab (and the EP clinic which feeds the EP lab); if you can't/don't want to do EP procedures anymore, you're ability to survive as a \"non-invasive\" EP in the current system is almost zero and that's why this term does not even exist.",

Also you will be surprised on how your career can change when you start fellowship - I started fully committed to advanced imaging MRI/CI but then pivoted to interventional, so I wouldn't worry about that as much. \n\nIn general: \n\nLook at overall procedural volumes for general fellows (if you really want IC make sure gen fellows actually get cath autonomy).  I did something like 6-700 diagnostic caths with good autunomy before IC fellowship and it helped tremendously.  Don't go to a program where fellows are double logging caths and having to co scrub everything to get their numbers. \n\nLook at call schedule and how the years are organized, my gen cards fellowship was very heavily weighted towards first year so third year I got to do a TON of extra cath\n\nSounds dumb but make sure the fellows are happy - don't go to a place where everyone is pissed and you're gonna get dumped on",

My home program (community) where I did gen cards training informally offered me an EP spot. I’ve interviewed broadly and have several larger academic programs that I have a solid chance of matching as well. My home program is by no means forcing me to lock them in, and they’ve graciously offered to pick up the phone and call other programs if I want them to.\n\nPart of me wants to go to a larger academic program, but a not insignificant part of me wants to go back to my home community program where I know the group well, know there is adequate exposure to the breadth of EP (except epicardial VT), and have a good relationship with the non-EPs as well. I would also be able to scrub into IC cases for pericardiocentesis, impella placement, diagnostic angiograms, etc as there is no in-house IC fellowship. The fact that I’ve been out of the lab for 3 years also gives me some worry about being thrown abruptly back into a hard-charging procedural fellowship, and going back to my home program at least gives me the comfort of familiarity, at the cost of it not being an academic place. \n\nMy ultimate goal is to practice community EP, and I wouldn’t mind an 80/20 EP/gen cards split given I’ve already built up significant gen cards experience. I’m currently boarded in echo (level 3), CT and Nuc (level 2 for both), if that’s relevant.\n\nI’d appreciate any guidance/opinions/perspectives others may have.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys I’m currently a 2nd year cardiology fellow and I’m planning to do an EP fellowship. I’m on J1 visa so would need to extend my J1 to 8 years instead of 7 and then do a waiver job.\n\nIf there are any PDs in the group or APDs or anyone that has any thoughts: how bad is it if I do my waiver job after general fellowship to get my green card (takes 3-4 years) and then come back to do an EP fellowship vs doing it right after general?\n\nLooking forward to some input thanks!",

Do it in one stretch. The J1 is as good as it gets for matching into EP (next only to Citizenship/Green Card) and PDs always want fellows fresh out of training (ppl have gone back to training after a few years of attendinghood in cardiology, but it's the exception rather than the rule). EP is also becoming more competitive with each year due to the earning potential and lifestyle (IC had plenty of unfilled spots in last year's match as opposed to EP which had unmatched candidates and filled all spots up front), so do it while you're still able to",

It only takes a few minutes but it gives you a good idea of what the actual exam answer sheet will be like.\n\n  \nI will say that, of all the board exams I have ever taken, this one left me feeling the worst.

This is achievable in many clinical cardiology programs and possibly some community programs or academic programs that allow elective time instead of research time. Otherwise youd need to do some type of extra dedicated ”imaging” year where they usually give you additional training in ct/mri and nuc. If you cant achieve the time requirement in your program you should really consider if the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\n2) Case requirements—i believe its 150 TEE’s; perform, like do the scanning for 150 TTE’s; read over 750 TTE; read 200 DSE’s, then there are some other things like 50 or so strain studies, 100 contrast studies, some interventional tee studies, and some ice studies. Those are just minimum numbers but in reality youd want to be well above those bench marks.\n\n3) Scholarly activity—usually people do some type of QA/QI type thing. \n\nOnce you have completed all that you then have to have a letter from the director of your echo lab stating that you achieved all that stuff. Understand though that you do not need level 3 to perform tee’s or interpret ttes etc. level 3 provides you the ability to run an echo lab.

    "selftext": "For board purposes, when should we be coding for LAFB/LPFB?\n\nI understand the general definition and appearance of the either but what i dont get is when to code. My understanding is that we code for either when there is NO other reason for the axis change AND the QRS &lt; 120ms. However, on some of these board prep courses, despite there being an old MI, LVH or RVH I see them being coded and the RAD/LAD not getting scored. I am planning to give up on trying to code these as I dont see any good strategy for when to code these over LAD/RAD. Any advice is appreciated! \n\nThanks",

I don't think it's worth coding for it and risk losing a point unless otherwise the ekg is normal and as you mentioned no LVH or MI present.",

You have to be decent at reading ECGs to make this approach work, but presumably you are at this point.",

For PCI we have some data showing symptom improvement in patients with angina AND HFrEF but no strong trials supporting PCI as a reasonable treatment for HFrEF itself. The closest that we get is short term sub-group analysis in smaller noninferiority studies like AWESOME…certainly nothing we should base practice on. Are there data that I am unaware of? \n.\n.\n\n\nFor CABG:\n\nI think the indication for CABG is much broader than this. I agree with the LM and MV disease (when one is LAD) preference for CABG.  But it can be used for disease that is complex (as in SYNTAX trials) or otherwise higher risk for PCI. \n\nCABG is also the method that trial data supports for treating heart failure with reduced EF (STICH and CASS trials).

Lexicomp and other drug databases consider this an X-interaction due to decreased efficacy of Clopidogrel, so I always send a message to the pcp recommending a switch to another PPI such as pantoprazole or to an h2ra.

Or amiodarone loading dose which apparently epic has never heard of; or combination of amiodarone and digoxin; or digoxin in many many subset of patients for whom there’s really no risk at all if you know what you’re doing, etc. Crap is infuriating really.",

On monitor patient is being regularly V-paced with rates intermittently in 120. What is happening here? The pacemaker was interrogated and is working fine. Thought process is that patient might have underlying AFib that is causing this. This confuses me a lot so please help me understand. If the patient is in AFib, why is the patient being v-paced at rate of 120s. In AFib, wouldn't pacemaker go into inhibition mode sensing the qrs ? Or since they are coming at irregular intervals, the pacemaker just paced Everytime? I am sorry just a newbie nurse trying to understand. Patient is mostly asymptomatic with maybe slight drop in pressure. He was eventually started on amio again. ",

AMS? negative FAST but the family is keen on sudden behavioral and/or mentation changes? Better activate the stroke alert and get 'em to CT.\n\nNow imagine this mindset with STEMI, interpreting an EKG that isn't a slam dunk tombstoning MI is harder than they make it seem in medics school. There are ultimately several potential causes of ischemia that don't need the cath lab. I have watched seasoned paramedics call HF, demand ischemia, and even pericarditis EKG's STEMIs, just to get it deferred by the EDP and eventually by cardio when it reaches them. Hell, hospitals are guilty of these IFT's too, where they'll literally diagnose them with \"STEMI\" and their EKG does not show correlative ST elevation or any indication of transmural injury. \n\nDtB time is great, but the balloon needs to be indicated for the right patients that will benefit the most. 100% agree on early transmission in the field.",

The hospital didn’t care until we translated into dollars. We are a high volume center for stemi and at 10-20% inappropriate activation it just wasn’t feasible.

First, I think it's important to recognize that the global umbrella of \"EMS\" covers an extremely wide range of education, scope of practice, quality assurance, etc. There are EMTs with less than a year of education who work on the ambulance part time with the fire department and are highly protocol-dependent; there are also intensive/advanced/critical care paramedics with postgraduate level education and well-developed clinical judgment, who are quite familiar (and practiced) with evidence-based ECG interpretation and relevant clinical guidelines. And lots in between. So I think the answer to this question depends at least partly on your local system.  \n  \nThat being said, I work in a system where our Advanced Care Paramedics can transmit ECGs directly to an on-call IC and then call them directly to discuss the case. The IC can refuse it or activate the cath lab with us transporting directly there, bypassing the ED. We also perform prehospital thrombolysis and related pharmacology under their orders. This has worked well here for many years. Our data shows it has greatly improved DTB times and STEMI mortality.",

However…you should NOT try to force something like this.  Wanting to be a cardiologist because of interests that you can convey in a PS as part if an application that shows aspirations and hard work is actually very attractive.",

        "body": "I went to an IM residency at a strong community hospital that had a brand new cardiology fellowship at the time. I had always wanted to do cardio but because of some life events I couldn’t apply and was a hospitalist at a community hospital without a fellowship. Throughout that time I kept in touch with the cardio attendings which definitely helped me get an interview and eventually a spot. Being a hospitalist was helpful because I was used to the heavy load of patients on my census and it helped me make decisions a little quicker. It also allowed the attendings to trust me a bit more which also gave me confidence and eventually I was chief.\n\nI also basically didn’t do any research before or during fellowship (I hate it) but I also didn’t get many interviews. I definitely think I got a spot because of networking, so start now.\n\nWhile I was in fellowship there were several hospitalists that were interested in applying. Some of them came to every noon lecture. This helped them network with the fellows and attendings and one or two actually got a spot. But some of them were kind of “clingy” or weird and it definitely hurt them. So being a hospitalist at a program may help you get an interview, but not a spot, so you still have to pump up your resume in other ways. \n\nI would email the program director at the program nearby or where you want to go and offer to help with any research that the fellows are doing (more to show your work ethic and collaborative side in my opinion), go to ACC and meet some program directors (helped some people get an interview at my program), audition in your off weeks as a hospitalist or moonlight, go to fellow noon conferences where you want to go (as long as they are cool with it), etc. But again, networking is key so start now!",

        "body": "As others have said, networking and demonstrating clinical skill.\n\n1. First and foremost, you have to be clinically good- cardiology is a high acuity field and many programs will look for clinical skill first and foremost. This means doing well clinically in your residency and on away rotations (see below) on cardiology services at the other hospital. There are cases where residents who did a lot of research were not ranked highly by the program because of poor clinical performance. \n\n2. Doing away rotations at the larger academic center if your program allows. See if they can work with you such that you do 2-4 weeks on their cardiology consult service or in their cardiology ICU. You can use that as a springboard to demonstrate clinical skill, good teamwork skills, etc. and meet attendings and discuss research. It may be more chart review-type stuff and they may have you work with a fellow at that program but its a way to ultimately get LORs. \n\n3. Hospitalist years do not add much to the application by themselves, and some cardiology programs may be concerned if people have been too long out of residency (&gt;2 years for example) because procedural skills, exposure to cardiology, etc. can drop off. Alternatively, heart failure goes unfilled every year. If you are at the point of taking a hospitalist year, another alternative may be to do an unaccredited heart failure year which gets you 1 year at an academic program training with their HF attendings (and potentially research, etc.). After this, you would have a much easier time getting LORs from the HF attendings and you may have gotten some research through this. \\*\\*Note: I have heard of, but haven't met, people who did this. Best discussing with the cardiology PD at that program.",

What I can tell you, from what I’ve been exposed to so far, is that getting into cardiology is 90% about who you know. How you build that network can be through doing well clinically and RESEARCH exposure. I think the most efficient way for research exposure is through conferences -something I wish I would’ve taken advantage of more. If you can get your hands on a case report, at the very least, and submit it for presentation that gets your foot in the door. Cold emails work. Best if a faculty can introduce you like someone mentioned but not the end of the world if not. Express genuine interest and see what they say -they can really only say no. Send a bunch, meet with a bunch of people. Faculty at academic institutions are used to residents reaching out to them, and they are well aware that you have to shop around for a project that fits. Don’t worry about having to say “no” or meeting with too many people and not being able to commit at that first meeting. Focus on quality now instead of fluff quantity. \n\nI’m not sure if a hospitalist year just to do it will make you competitive. Getting a job as a CV hospitalist at an academic institution could be really beneficial though. Keep in mind that you’ll basically be auditioning for a year though. However, it will get you exposure to all the cardiologist in the department and if you’re good they can vouch for you (connections is key). A former fellow calling the PD on your behalf can get you an interview etc. Just my two cents.. but again, I haven’t matched yet!! But prayerfully I do🙏🏾 \n\nGood luck to you. You can totally do it!!",

    "selftext": "Hi all. Wanted to get some thoughts on fellow IC’s who have any experience with the refinity IVUS catheter and syncvision. Is syncvision truly helpful or is it just cumbersome? I’m faced with the decision on switching our lab’s IVUS catheter to Boston (with large capital expense) vs. keeping volcano and obtaining syncvision (for free). If anybody can share their opinion on syncvision that would be great. ",

        "body": "I haven't used the syncvision. I'll echo u/Onion01 with regards to the counterintuitive crossing profile of the two. Boston: smaller crossing profile, however flimsy with no pushability. Volcano: larger crossing profile, however more support and may cross stubborn areas. \n\nVolcano is manual pullback only. The sled with Boston IVUS is nice, but around 20% of the time I will do manual pullback. Also it takes longer to set up and is more cumbersome. I don't trust the lengths that the sled will provide sometimes it's off. \n\nAlso consider artifacts. Boston IVUS is rotational, so you can get NURD artifact in tortuous vessels. Volcano is a phased array so you don't get the NURD artifact. Due to the rotational system you need to flush the Boston IVUS to get bubbles out and sometimes have to flush during imaging to clean up the image, this is not needed in phased array IVUS. Volcano you can get ring artifacts so you need to ring down in healthy lumen. \n\nI use both, but use Boston more often, but not for any clear reason. I'll use whatever I have in the room. Boston has better images but more cumbersome to deal with. Volcano is more straight forward with not as good of an image.",

Bosci is more deliverable and the hd is much better quality pictures for information more than just sizing. It’s more deliverable and from what I remember from fellowship the sled does a nice controlled pull back with coregistration on there as well. I use ivus for 90% of my pcis and my shop only has volcano so I’ve gotten used to it.",

    "selftext": "I'm a PGY-5 Rheum fellow highly considering a switch to cardiology. I'm a USMD and was a good IM resident at an academic program with some cards research during residency. \n\nI wanted to pursue cardiology since med school. I love the physiology, ECG’s, echos/imaging, long term patient management, and procedures but had a brutal CCU rotation intern year and my home program was quite malignant, which pushed me towards Rheum. The fellows/staff in rheum were super chill and the lifestyle is pretty amazing.\n\nI don’t hate being a rheumatologist, some of the diseases can be rewarding to treat and patients are generally thankful, but I deplore the fibro/undifferentiated pain patients, non-specific testing and significant reliance on other specialties (renal biopsies, pulm for ILD, derm for psoriasis, ortho for joints). A lot of it feels like being the PCM/quarterback again. \n\nCardiology was my original passion in medicine and non-invasive cards looks better on paper: hot market with most salaries in all locations being 500K+, more central in medicine, definitive testing/treatments, only piggy backing between IC/EP &amp; CTS. I know the downsides are an inpatient consult service/call, working nights/weekends, revolving-door admissions, and more training. \n\nI'm planning to try attending rheum lifestyle for a year or two before deciding to reapply. I still have some strong cards connections from residency, pretty much all my friends went cards. Age is a consideration as well, but I went straight through for everything so I’d be about 37-38 y.o. when finishing gen cards if am able to successfully match and retrain. I know some cardiologists who did 2-4 years of IM between fellowship so that's not too far off/unheard of. \n\nFor those in non-invasive Cards:\n- Are you happy with your call burden, patients, hospital grind? \n- Do you find it fulfilling long-term, or just as repetitive as other IM subspecialties but with more stress?\n- If you could go back, would you still pick Cards over a lifestyle field like Rheum, allergy, endo (no call, nights, weekends, inpatient)?",

Far too many patients rely on NP, PA, chiropractors and eastern medicine practitioners as their primary health experts.  Many consult for anything (and often nothing).  Meanwhile, primary care MDs and DOs are generally highly-incentivized to see more patients.  They make more money by referring after a 5 minute visit than they do by spending 5 more minutes and solving problems themselves.  Also, shockingly to me, many newer grads in primary care don't seem to know the most basic guidelines for treating things like primary hypertension or ASCVD risk. It creates a lot more work for us.  \n\nI will say that one big difference between cardiology and rheumatology when it cries to these \"undifferentiated\" patients is that we generally have well-defined diagnostic and treatment protocols that we can follow. Most of us (well, at least me) don't continue to follow/treat chest pain or dysautonomia once cardiovascular causes are addressed or excluded.  I don't think that is how rheum works.",

It would give you the comfort handling most of what you can imagine with coronaries in cath lab\n- If you enjoy vascular interventions and expect to have a job at a place with less coverage of vascular surgery, vascular training is great, but personally a whole dedicated year is overkill unless you want to do Carotids or EVARs and very complex PAD stuff\n- If you enjoy STEMIS and PCIs but cath Lab is not all what you want to do in practise and enjoy mix of imaging, clinic and seeing patient's, do interventional year with all the passion and just join a busy practise. You will most likely financially come out ahead of everyone above.\n\nI was the most passionate fellow when it came to my interventional year and had excellent vascular experience and training during that year. And few years in a busy practise I want to be less and less in the cath Lab. There is absolutely no need to risk higher complications by doing high risk stuff unless its your passion. It just does not make sense in non-academic busy practise. I do coronaries and vascular in my busy practise and the real wrvus come from non-interventional work",

Pretty much everything else is saturated so you have to either be super lucky or make major concessions to get a good job. \n\nI am involved in hiring for a very large practice. We mostly hire right out of fellowship or early-career. Here is some perspective:\n\n\\- Most (about 80%) of our IC applicants have dedicated years of training for either structural or CHIP. \n\n\\- We have hired a total of two people ever with dedicated structural training. One of them was hired with the understanding that he would have limited structural volume and eventually elected to stop doing structural (he makes more money after stopping). The other one heads the structural program. We have enough ICs in our group that are interested in doing structural cases that we tend to train them when we need more people fr TAVR and other procedures rather than hire a new person for that.\n\n\\- We have never hired a new-grad or early-career person to do CHIP cases. We think those cases are best handled with our most experienced ICs (who often work with more junior ICs on those cases). \n\n\\- We have hired people with evdovascular/peripheral training. We don't mind if applicants have this, but it does not benefit our group significantly, so we don't preferentially hire them. In our area, vascular surgery or IR do most of these cases and our group is not currently interested in taking PERT or CLI call. \n\n\\- The applicants that we are most interested in are the ones with strong coronary training.\n\n\\- This highest earners in our group are ICs that do not do structural (or significant endovascular/CHIP).\n\n\\- The structural people in our group spend a significant amount of time coordinating the structural program. This means lots of meetings with hospital admin, fighting about reimbursement, planning meetings, outreach, etc. \n\nI also know quite a few early-career structural ICs who, even in mid-sized midwest cities, are only able to do very few structural cases because other IC colleagues prevent them from being able to do more (to protect their volume). \n\nOf all of these extra training opportunities, the one that makes the most practical sense is endovascular. However, that skill set is only valuable in certain regions and groups. It is also a skill that you can pick up after fellowship. \n\nWhen making this decision, don't be proud. If you love structural or really want a little more experience with complex cases, go ahead and do extra years. Do NOT expect this to make job hunting easier (it will do the opposite).",

I wanted to do structural and my first job was mostly coronaries with some structural, like 25-30 TAVR per year plus some PFOs. It gave me the experience to work on my own, which should NOT be underestimated. The best trained fellow in the world is less skilled than most people 1-2 years out of training with experience under their belt. \n\nThis also made me more competitive when my dream job opened up in structural. I get to be ultra high volume in a private practice with my personal volume now around 180 TAVR, 60 M/T-TEER, 50 PFO, etc. I would NOT have been hired for this right out of training. I knew the practice and kept in touch with them every year to find out when they may be hiring.  \n\nSuffice to say train in what your passion is. Extra training can often make you less competitive as people don’t want to hire structurally trained docs to protect their volume, often the same for peripheral. CTO really you can learn techniques even after you finish, and you’re likely to get mow out of extra training after a few years out in practice. You can get proctored or join a procedure for a patient you refer to a larger center to get some experience (if you have a good relationship with the larger center).",

My now 61 year old brother was prescribed atorvostatin about 2 years ago after admission to hospital for DKA (DM2 was diagnosed about 3 years earlier- was under good control with diet and exercise after a short run on insulin-until after his second covid infection about 10 weeks beofre this admission for DKA). He is obese, never smoked and regular exerciser. Our dad had his first MI at 41.  They incidentally found a serious problem with his heart. Particularly his heart rhythm.  Echo showed significantly reduced EF (30%)and mild heart failure global weakness and hypokinesis.  Angiogram showed no blockages.  Cardiac  MRI showed concerning evidence for sarcoidosis.  Anyway he got biventricular pacemaker with ICD and was referred to University because of the heart failure and unclear cause.  At that admission he started atorvostatin.  Subsequent cardiac PET scan ruled out sarcoid and amyloidosis but the cardiologist had no idea what the tiny deposits in heart muscle and around the right atrium were that seem to cause inflammation.  He hasn't had a calcium score done. \"Idiopathic cardiomyopathy\" was the final diagnosis.\n\nHe texted me a few weeks ago and said the pharmacist from the cardiologists office said it was OK to STOP the atorvostatin.  I was kinda shocked. My brother just asked about the med and had no problems taking it or concerns about taking it. He is taking his health much more seriously. His understanding was that his heart was much better and the pharmacist said it was OK to stop and just \"wait and see\".  Wait and see for what? .  He didn't know it wasn't a heart med so much as to reduce cholesterol. I asked him to really reach out the MD and clarify.  Seems with DM2 that has since been very difficult to control, family history,etc seems like lowering risk worth taking the inexpensive med. \n\nInpatient PT here that does inpatient cardiac rehab and post/op cardiac cases. yeah, resistance to statins everywhere.  Sheesh I am on the drug now for a few years.  Not a guy, but looking at the risk reduction and coming from a family of folks dropping dead from heart issues young I am on board. Well I still might drop dead from heart issues......",

I read my own echoes and nuclear stress tests.\n\nHad to take a part time job for personal reasons.\n\nI signed a job fresh out of fellowship before I really understood what RVUs and RVU threshold were.\n\nI am thinking about increasing my workdays to 4 days a week and so will be renegotiating my contract soon.\n\nOut of curiosity, I decided to look up on MGMA what the regional average RVU threshold and compensation were for my area and am worried I am being severely underpaid based on what I read.\n\nI am currently being compensated $39 per RVU and my RVU threshold is 5025. This is for 60% FTE.\n\nBase pay: $215,000\n\nI am seeing average per RVU is 65-70 in this area, for 7000-7500 RVUs for a full time cardiologist, but does that include bonus only or bonus + base? Can someone give me some perspective on where I fall in terms of what I’m being offered? Does this sound fair?\n\nI feel like my RVU threshold should be lower around 4260 and pay per RVU should be around 60-70 for a 60% FTE.\n\nI would love any insight/perspective on if this is fair and guidance for negotiating for a more fair base pay/RVUs.

So my technique was to use my left index and second finger to feel the pulse and feel the pulse with both fingers. This allows you to see the direction your needle needs to go. I go in at a 60 degree angle and once I get a flash I go through. As I slowly pull the angiocath out I watch the catheter itself and when you start seeing red in the tubing itself I slow down and pull until I have pulsatile flow. Then I insert the guide wire, spinning it as I advance and should meet no resistance. \n\nIf your unable to pass the wire and feel resistance immediately you're either not pulling the angiocath back enough or you've pulled it too far. When I pull it I pull back while rotating it back and forth in my fingers while looking at the exposed part of the Cath at the skin. I pull back with my left hand and my left hand is anchored on the patients arm with my pinky so it doesn't move. I have my wire in my right hamd ready to insert. As you pull back you'll see it fill red. Then I slow down and slowly pull back until pulsatile flow, stop, then insert wire. \n\nIt takes practice, practice, practice. Shallower angle can help because it gives you more time in the lumen of the vessel.\n\nGood luck",

Seeing his prior 12 lead while he was in flutter as well as a 12 lead rhythm strip of his current rhythm would be useful. There is clear AV conduction intermittently seen in lead V1. Can’t call that a capture beat because the QRS morphology doesn’t change and that beat comes in later than the prior RR intervals. It would be very unusual but you could have bundle branch re-entry or VT around the exit site of the RBB with a lot of wobble and during extreme wobble you see atrial activity - far too unlikely to make sense. \n\nI have a suspicion this is flutter (based on the fact that you mention prior flutter) with a Wenkebach type conduction with aberrancy but more data as mentioned above would be useful. Cardioversion was the right choice regardless",

Differential would be an irregular VT, sinus with really frequent non-sustained atrial tach, or sustained AT or flutter with baseline aberrancy. If he converted out of this with cardioversion, then unlikely to be frequent non-sustained AT. In the heat of the moment; cardioversion is the correct call because he isn’t going to be conscious for much longer with an EF of 25% regardless of the arrhythmia mechanism.

I really like that you can make a real difference in people's lives and it is intellectually fascinating. Now as an M3 working on a cardiology device research project, I have learned about up and coming AI devices that can read EKG and perhaps even echoes as well as or better than human cardiologists. I haven't seen any of the highly accurate ones used clinically yet where I have shadowed, but I think it is coming soon. A lot of the risk stratification and medical management seems to follow algorithms from large studies, which could also be taken over by AI. In a psych study, patients found the AI more empathetic than human physicians so AI could even take over the communication aspect. I still have two more years of medical school, three years of internal medicine, and three years of general cardiology (if I match) - also was considering EP or IC (so 1-2 more years). So 8-10 more years before I could even start practicing and AI will probably only get better by then. Where do you see the future of the practice of cardiology heading with AI long-term?",

Surgeons losing ground to noninvasive techniques, algorithmaztion and the ride of APPs moving everyone to formulaic medicine, etc etc. there are several areas in which I believe cardiology will remain robust moving forward. The most important will be procedure techniques, especially if you wanna be an interventional cardiologist or an electrophysiologist. Now interventional cardiology will and has been losing volume in regards to step placement, but that has been mitigated somewhat by the rise of structural cardiology. Despite lower reimbursement rates, EP remains a robust field, both for device placement, as well as the ever-expanding rule of ablation. And even if you didn’t want to be in a procedural base field, there will remain for the foreseeable future a strong need for cardiology imagers. This is not to say that AI won’t have an impact on the field, but I would challenge you to find an area of medicine that won’t be impacted.",

But when they're getting stretched 7 kinds of sideways by so many different responsibilities, signing things in MUSE is the literal least important job. Unfortunately this often results in just automatically clicking sign without actually changing what the computer put there. Usually this is fine because clicking sign just generates a bill and the actual clinician the day of looked at the EKG which most likely didn't change clinical care. BUT every once in a while the computer is dead wrong, and the dead tired cardiologist didn't catch it, and the clinician the day of can't read the EKGs and something gets missed. Everyone has that meeting back in the day with the manager with the uncomfortable \"um did you mean to click sign when the computer read asystole\" or somesuch. (Or there's the apocryphal or not-so-apocryphal ahem tale of too many cardiologists retiring, the EKG backlog getting crazy, and some dead tired guy builds a python script to auto-click sign on tens of thousands of EKGs in one night and then EPIC flagged it as unusual, investigation ensues)\n\nAI isn't directly competing with cardiologists. What it's gonna do is help shit not accidentally fall through the gaps. \n\nStill, my confidence that the machine will be able to read EKGs, much less dynamic imaging like echos well, is very very low.

It's really bad with tachycardias (usually calls flutter or AT as ST) and moderately bad with bradycardia, missing a lot of 2:1 AVB, etc.\n\nAs with almost all areas of medicine, it's the fringe cases where we really prove our worth.

Work at a program where they take cardiac hospitalists. You can do a non accredited fellowship too but only do it if they take those candidates (most programs don't take their own non accredited fellowship candidates, and if so, don't waste your time with those and lose hospitalist money and ability to get a green card during that time as these non accredited programs won't sponsor a green card and are just looking for cheap labor). Get an EB2-NIW petition filed to lock in your priority date since you have decent research. \n\nFor the next cycle get LoRs from ppl who are well known names on the field.. The common advice of 'A strong LoR from your community program cardiologist is better than a generic LoR from a well known figure' isn't true in cardiology. It's ALL about connections, especially with no scores to compare (Step 1) and with every candidate having 15-25 pubs and 30+ abstracts on an average ( usually paper mill type, low quality ones). If you're bold, try applying to J1 programs too the next cycle (especially if you're Indian and can't get a green card soon). It's better to do a waiver job as a cardiologist than work as a hospitalist for 5 years, frustrated about not being able to follow your dreams.\n\nFinally don't give up. You've worked hard for this and you will get it in the end. It's a question of WHEN and never IF. Good luck👍.",

I’m looking for any guidance on which of these (or any others!) would be the best bang for my buck and appropriate for my level.\n\nThanks so much!",

Use the practice questions to find weak areas.\nBecause ACC updates its content yearly and covers all the transplant / MCS / guideline shifts, you’ll stay current.\n\nEven if you don’t need certification, this gives you confidence and covers breadth.\nSimultaneously gear up for HFSA HF‑Cert, or plan to sit for it in 6‑12 months:\nUse the ACC SAP to help prepare for HFSA exam: fill in any gaps.\n\nDo the HFSA bootcamp / board review (on‑demand) to reinforce exam‑style content. That will help with test strategy and picking up high‑yield topics.\n\nIf cost is a concern, pick selectively:\nYou may not need both full ACC SAP + full HFSA bootcamp at once. Depending on your schedule / employer support, you could maybe alternate or do parts.\n\nUse free / lower‑cost offerings: some pilot CMP‐versions, open webinars, review articles, guideline updates (HFSA, ACC, AHA) etc.\n\nIn your first few months in practice, tailor your study plan:\n\nKeep a journal/log of cases you see that stretch you (e.g. transplant rejections, LVAD complications, outpatient GDMT titrations). In those domains, do targeted reading / sessions.\n\nAttend multidisciplinary HF rounds, transplant meetings, shadow transplant cardiologists, pharmacists, immunologists etc. Learning from practice is powerful.\nConsider your employer / institution support:\nDoes your institution pay for CME / certification / subscriptions? Could they get you ACC membership / SAP access?\nAre there internal credentialing / promotion benefits to HFSA HF‑Cert in your center?\nOther programs / resources you might consider\n\nHere are some additional programs or resources that might be helpful extras:\nHFSA’s Optimal Medical Therapy in Heart Failure (OMT‑HF) Certificate Program — specifically focused on guideline‑driven medical therapy, which is often one of the biggest gaps. \n\nHeart Failure Society of America\n\nMayo Clinic / CVEducation “Heart Failure Management for NP, PA, and Primary Care Providers” — sometimes offered as in‑person / livestream workshops. Good for interactive learning. \n\ncveducation.mayo.edu\nRecent guideline documents (ACC/AHA/HFSA) &amp; consensus statements (e.g. on myocarditis, HFpEF) – stay up to date.\nCase‑based learning: attending transplant/advanced HF conferences, webinars; reading “Cardiac Failure Review” / “Journal of Cardiac Failure” etc.\n\nMentorship: having a transplant cardiologist or advanced HF physician or senior NP/PA to review cases with you, discuss decision‑making rationales.\n\nMy suggestion: what I would do if I were you\nIf I were starting your role, here’s what I’d plan:\n\nPurchase ACC HF SAP (5‑year membership if possible but maybe 1‑year if budget or time limited), and work through it gradually (maybe 1 topic per month or more depending on workload).\n\nRegister for HFSA HF‑Cert exam window that is ~9‑12 months out, giving myself time to prepare with SAP plus supplement with HFSA bootcamp or on‑demand review.\nUse OMT‑HF certificate to shore up outpatient GDMT, which is important.\nCombine reading key guideline updates as soon as they come out, attend transplant / device rounds, perhaps find a case conference series.",

What I'm finding is that while EKGs are performed incredibly frequently in hospitals and emergencies, there seems almost no formal training for performing them. \n\nI'm seeing research showing that supine-position limb-lead placement recommendations can be anywhere from the wrist/ankle to the torso and that placement can noticeably or negligibly impact the results. I'm seeing some people on reddit advising others to put electrodes V4-V5-V6 in a horizontal plane and others saying to follow the 5th intercostal space. I've been told personally on the job by one person to make sure V3 goes below the sternum and by another person that the RA and LA electrodes MUST be located above the heart, and I  have gathered both pieces of advice are inaccurate at best. I'm seeing research showing EKG interpretations by physicians are only about 50-75 percent accurate.\n\nTl'dr:  The incredible lack of training and variations in techniques in performing EKGs is confounding to me.\n\nSo, I want to ask this subreddit's opinions: How much faith do you put in a standard hospital EKG and the people performing them?",

The limb leads are largely to determine the QRS axis, and vicariously to get the rhythm strip via the lead most likely to capture the axis, II.

V1 and V2 should be placed above the R and L atria, ideally, and also correspond to the septal plane. From there V3-V6 capture the rest of the heart with V6 ideally corresponding the left lateral side ( i.e. at the mid-axillary line).",

        "body": "As a lot of people have said, the precordial (chest) leads are the ones where placement matters the most, however limb lead placement does matter too. For an educational topic I once did a few test EKG’s with different placement. In one example I placed the limb leads on the upper chest and lower abdomen, and this caused notably different QRS morphologies. If V1 and V2 are too high up you can get inverted P waves. If V5-6 are placed too anterior you can get what looks like poor R-wave progression. \n\nTips and tricks from me on getting a good and clean EKG, that have no actual evidence but are just anecdotal. For the limb leads I use the lateral upper arm approximately 1/3 of the way down from the shoulder and then the medial lower leg about 1/3 up from the ankle. I also palpate for the 4th intercostal space for V1/2 and then base the others off that. For V4-6 I palpate the next space down and place off of that. I use the horizontal method if I cannot feel the space well or all the way around. If it’s hard to feel for the intercostal spaces, the Angle of Louis, which is the bump near the top of the sternum, is at the level of the 2nd rib and therefor the 2nd intercostal space is just below that.\n\nTo reduce artifact I have the patient rest their arms at their side and lay their head back, no talking. I also have the bed laid at a 30-45 degree angle (if they can tolerate it). Also, if you’re getting a lot of artifact from their breathing, you likely have the electrodes too low, or they need to be laid back more to elongate the space between the chest and abdomen. I have also on a rare occasion asked the pt to hold their breath for the 10 seconds if they are able and it’s appropriate.\n\nETA: to answer your question, and seeing how sloppy and poorly some of my coworkers do EKG’s, I wouldn’t trust them too much in a critical setting. But for a “routine” ekg where there likely isn’t any cardiac issues and we’re getting it for a baseline/CYA I think they turn out fine enough.",

    "selftext": "- Been doing locums tenens (LT) for several years and as director of cath lab hired LT MDs for my large health system.\n- Have worked for a smattering of small LT companies and 2 of the largest, better known: Weatherby and CompHealth (now owned by the same group, BTW).\n- It is a mixed bag but in general a positive rewarding experience.\n- IC LT demand seems is increasing. Published data and personal experience, more calls / emails asking if available. \n- Reasons are multiple but include an overall shortage of IC MDs due to fellowship programs output not keeping up with demand, many IC left and did not return to the workforce after COVID, difficult replaceability with APPs, removal of prior restrictions which now allow for outpt cath labs, venture capital interest in the latter, etc. \n- Working for a 3rd party (hired by a LT company) is a good place to start. They take care of everything. Finding the assignment, help processing hospital credentialing, travel and stay arrangements, help obtaining a license in another state (when worth it for them and the contracting hospital). \n- Expect full malpractice coverage with tail provided by them also but no other benefits. \n- A typical arrangement is a base daily rate, currently ~ $2-3K/d + an hourly “after hour” or “call back” rate. \n- Devil is in the details. What a “day” is, is variable and often negotiable. E.g, a weekday “day” may consist of 9 hrs (8 am to 5 pm), after that or if you get called back to the hospital after that, the call-back rate kicks in for an additional ~ $300-400/hr. A weekend “day” is often but not always shorter. E.g. ~6 hrs. \n- Holidays are typically 1.5-2 X the daily base rate. \n- Lower / higher rates working less / more hours exist and are often negotiable depending on location, how soon you can start, the unmet needs of that hospital or group, your experience as IC and performance as prior LT MD for that company, expected call / work burden, if doing IC only or + gen cards, etc. \n- There are companies that specialize in “perm locums” jobs where you are contracted for 1 yr (or more) to go to the same place for 1-2 wks / mo on a permanent rotation with other 1-3 IC docs who may share a place and car for the duration of the contract. \n- If contracting directly with a hospital or group, ~3-4K/d are usual but there is more variability here as other factors are involved like if malpractice is offered or not, if you are a temporary “one-off” to fill for vacation or maternity leave or if you are committing to a recurrent gig few days a wk or more in advance.\n- Do not try to bypass a LT company after you have been introduced to a hospital by them or even if that hospital is using that same company and you are approached by them. You will not only be blacklisted (and now healthgroups own multiple companies) but then you would have probably signed a contract explicitly prohibiting so. They have deeper pockets and better lawyers than you do. \n- Assigned LT dates can be cancelled by either party. Usually at no penalty if notice given 2-7 day in advance. This cuts both ways. Shit happens and I have a one strike policy with a contracting hospital. I once got full payment for a weekend when on my way to the hospital they realized they had made a mistake and did not need me. That is rare but kudos to Weatherby who did that. My experience with them was excellent. \n- Working as a LT can be a challenge. As an IC you are often working in a hospital with no CT surgery back-up. You have to be tolerant, adaptable, and be comfortable bailing yourself out of tight spots. All while remaining professional and personable. When hiring IC MDs myself I have stopped calling some when my lab staff or ED docs reported them as grouchy. Honestly, the most challenging part sometimes is working with an EMR you are not used to. After all, in essence a cath lab is a cath lab and a stent looks the same in all places. \n- Unfortunately, and I am aware this is a gross generalization based on personal experience, IC MDs doing LT may sometimes be of subpar quality. You may get someone who could not hold a job or doing it past their prime, or jaded from burnout. There is also an inherent lack of commitment that is part of the temporary nature of LT.  \n- Why do I do locums as IC? In brief, I find it fun. I enjoy the challenge. I often go to non-urban but beautiful places to do good work. I worked once with FEMA on a disaster area that found themselves with no IC on short notice. \n- The fact that you get paid handsomely to do that helps. It has given me a bit of a “fck you” cushion toward my current job, knowing that I can walk away from it and will be fine. I am also using it a path into near-future retirement. I did not want to start trying it right before. \n- Where to find IC LT jobs? I would start with said companies above but a simple google search would reveal hundreds of companies. Some smaller ones may even offer better deals. Some job gigs are offered to multiple companies at once, some are exclusive. \n\nHope that helps. Good luck but do NOT message me with any followup, offers or questions. They will all be ignored, blocked, deleted, and I will put a curse on you so that your stents do not cross and your groins bleed. ",

IC Cardiology locums don’t seem too attractive from financial perspective compared to full time IC Cardiology jobs.\n\nFor example an internist/hospitalist in smaller area will make close to 300K/year. But if you do locums working similar shifts you can probably 100-150 K extra, ofcourse you are going to smaller places. \n\nOn the contrary IC cardiology full time in smaller area can make close to 700-800, vs doing locums from numbers above, you are making way less and ofcourse cons are you are away from home/family and sometimes in the middle of nowhere.

I’m reaching out to ask for your suggestions and recommendations, as I’m currently considering doing a PhD in cardiovascular research.\n\nI’ve spent several weeks shadowing in cardiology wards. While I greatly enjoy the clinical work, I also want to gain experience in research. My impression from shadowing was that most clinicians primarily follow established guidelines to diagnose and treat patients. Before fully committing to clinical practice, I would like to gain cutting-edge knowledge in a specific area through research, and then transition into a more clinical role.\n\nMy first question is whether, in your opinion, pursuing a PhD is a valuable step for someone aiming to become a cardiologist. Does having a PhD provide meaningful benefits in this field?\n\nIf so would you recommend doing the PhD before or after residency?\nAnd lastly do you have any recommendations regarding institutions where I could pursue a PhD?\n\nOne idea I’ve been considering is applying for a PhD position at the Karolinska Institute after graduating from medical school. During the four years of the PhD, I plan to learn the language so that I can later choose to do my residency either in Italy or Sweden.\n\nThank you very much for your time and any insights you can offer.",

My question is regarding the variability of vacation built into employment contracts. not so much how much total time off is allowed, but rather regarding consecutive days and weeks off.  \n\nI ask because I really like to do multi-day white water rafting trips with my family and I am curious how accessible time off for these sorts of adventures are in Cardiology across subspecialty and practice model. These trips usually include a week off at a time or perhaps more depending on the river. For example, the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon would be 3 weeks, the Middle Fork of the Salmon is maybe 10 days total, others are less like 1 week or as short as 4 days. If I went into Cardiology, would I be able to negotiate for these opportunities? or would I be giving them up?\n\nSome information I have been given is that if you are willing to accept a lower base compensation, the employer or group may be willing to accommodate coverage during these off periods. Can any of you confirm this is actually a practice in contract negotiation? \n\nIf anyone has experience or anecdotal info from the rocky mountain west or pacific northwest, that is where I would like to practice eventually. \n\n  \nThanks in advance.",

Some docs take very little \"PTO\" and some take a lot. Of course that is reflected in their RVUs. It's generally not an issue if they want to take a week or two weeks off. Hospital coverage is more or less of an issue depending on several factors. Size of the group is a big one. For a smaller practice you will need to be more accommodating of your partners. Larger groups less so. Also subspeciality dependent. For our group, our docs spend a lot of time at the hospital baseline so when several are on PTO at once it is a major hassle to arrange coverage. For gen cards or any more clinic focused practice, this is less of an issue. Overall I think most attendings in any speciality have the ability to negotiate contracts with generous time away and if it's a priority for you you will make it happen.",

EKG techs can also do ETT, MPI, event monitors, loop recorders, holter monitors, EP studies, pacemaker integration and more. It can be quite interesting and enjoyable. The pay between the jobs can be similar depending on where you live.\n\nNow doing sonography long term can be very damaging on your wrists.

I had no previous healthcare experience and this was my first \"big girl\" job when I was hired at the age of 27.\n\nI didn't have any trouble finding a job, but I had to be willing to move away from where my school was. I went to an accredited school. If you decide to go the sonography route, it needs to be an accredited school. Some programs require that you have previous health care experience and others don't. The programs that don't require it take a little longer to complete.\n\nThis is not easy. For prerequisites I had to take physics, college algebra, and anatomy and physiology 1 and 2, among other courses. The actual program was 15 months and I essentially slept, ate, and breathed echo. My school only accepted 10 students every year, and only seven of us graduated. Two of those that graduated washed out of this career after a year. The students that were seniors above me only graduated with four out of 10. It is an emotionally, physically, and mentally taxing career. Schooling was even more so. \n\nI don't wish to discourage you from pursuing cardiac sonography, however, many of the commenters in this sub don't actually do cardiac sonography. I feel it's important that I do not sugarcoat it.\n\nAI is also a large concern in our field. Some commenters were speaking about job security, but that will change, inevitably, in the coming years. I'm already preparing to get my ACS credential so that I can be a more valuable member of our team. I want to keep my job. \n\nIt's important to know that sonography in general has the highest muscoskeletal injury rate of any career. Most sonographers scan in pain or go home in pain every single day. The injury rates are around 98 to 99%. \n\nI love my job and it's been really good to me so far, but no one can make this choice for you. I think it's important to educate yourself on what an actual day in the life would be like for you to see if it lines up with what you want. If you're able to shadow an EKG tech and an echo tech, That might give you a good idea of what you might prefer.\n\nHonestly, if I could do it all over again, I would have gone the rad tech to nuc med route, or gone into nursing or physician's assisting.",

ECG is simple and can be taught in few hours at most, or minutes to say. \n\nFor cardiac sonography you need to take proper school with physics, anatomy, heart physiology and more. Probably first become an ultrasound tech, such as you do kidney, liver etc, then more training is needed to do cardiac. \nI’d say each cardiac echo has 75-100 or more images and video clips. You also most likely have to do primary read so cardiologist can edit and finalize it later. It may take long minutes for each case. Usually you have to push the 300 lbs machine around the hospital to get to patients ( usually if not always) if you do pediatrics then it needs way more education on congenital disease anatomy and diagnosis. So you really need to have a passion to learn and do it. It is physically and mentally really demanding. \n\nYou do it in awkward positions and have to pose the patients which are difficult ( too obese, attached to tubes and lines etc) many techs get arthritis or tendinitis in wrist , elbow, shoulder and waist only from doing the echo besides always pushing the machine. Some times you have to come back after hours at 3 AM to do a Stat or urgent case and actually help to make a diagnosis of say tamponade or RV strain, or a perforation  …\nSo duh, of course it gets better payment than ECG tech which I doubt needs much of a long training per se,\nI am a cardiologist so this is from my perspective.

    "selftext": "\nHi guys. I’m presently a UK cardiology resident and interested in doing a fellowship in the US. \n\nJust a bit of background about me:\n\nMy interest is in imaging cardiology (cross sectional)/inherited heart disease…I’m going to be approaching the end of my cardiology training in around 2-3 years and am midway through a PhD at a large research university that usually ranks well globally with a well reputed research group…my work is likely to result in a major publication as a minimum and I’m also leading on a fairly significant RCT which I should hopefully be presenting as a late breaking trial next year at either ESC or AHA depending on how timings work. My own PhD is funded through a competitively awarded research fellowship grant (it is pretty competitive within the UK though I imagine this wouldn’t get me much credit in the States). \n\nI’d probably have achieved European level 3 CMR accreditation by the end of this year (exam plus reported 300 MRIs) and hope to also have knocked off my cardiac CT level 2 in the next year or 18 months (exam plus reported 200 studies I think). I could work towards transthoracic echo  certification if it would help my application but I also want to do some training in cardiac device implantation here in the UK.\n\nI am interested in working in a new environment, largely for experience, and just wondered how feasible it is to get a cardiac imaging fellowship as an IMG in the US? I have no real long term intention of being in the US at this stage and want to return to the UK to take up a consultant job. \n\nI presume I’ll have to get ECFMG certified and sit Step 1 and Step 2 CK as a minimum but realistically  I’m only going to bother putting in the effort doing them if I have a decent chance of securing a fellowship somewhere. Similarly, my LoRs are likely to be from UK consultants/professors, granted one or two of them are of international renown…I’ve never worked in the US and therefore wouldn’t be able to get LoRs from US attendings. \n\nAdvice appreciated.",

        "body": "You seem very competitive and this type of fellowship is not generally excessively competitive, so I think you have an excellent shot if you can check off all the technical boxes (visa, program requirements, etc.). \n\nTake a look at the website below.  Programs specifically list when they are open to foreign fellowship graduates (which is what you would probably qualify as, even if you are technically a cardiology residency graduate).\n\n  \n[https://www.acc.org/Membership/Sections-and-Councils/Imaging-Section/Training-Resources](https://www.acc.org/Membership/Sections-and-Councils/Imaging-Section/Training-Resources)\n\nI would contact some of the programs and ask about requirements (for exams, etc.).  In the USA, cardiac imaging fellowships are not accredited by the ACGME.  This means that they don't have to follow strict rules about who participates, what the experience entails, etc.  Programs can more or less do whatever they want.  You may or may not be required to take ECFMG, Step exams, etc. depending on the program.  Programs that are listed as for \"US fellowship grads only\" may even be willing to take you if they want. \n\nI know that you plan to move back home after this experience. However, keep in mind that if you want to be eligible to practice in the USA, you will need to pass all the various tests AND do a primary residency in the USA (like internal medicine).  Depending on goals, you may need to repeat cardiology too.  If you are considering a US practice, imaging fellowship may not be the best place to start.",

Depending on symptoms either a holter or a stress test or CCTA. You can't provide me with a good history? Sorry buddy, you're getting a full work up.\n\nThen from their subsequent visits I hone in on what their main issue is.\n\nFor chatty patients I just move them along, nicely while nodding and smiling. For poor historians full set of labs, echo and maybe a stress test. \n\nInterpreter can be tough. I’m certified in medical Spanish and can speak Spanish fluently so I handle all the Spanish speak patients on my own. But you’re right.

I had an opportunity to match GI but picked cardiology instead (was interested in both). After seeing offers online for outpatient GI with ASC ownership + no call and $1 million+ salaries, I feel that I’ve made the wrong choice. Cardiology appears to be more work for less pay. Additionally my colleague who matched GI appears to have a much better schedule compared to me. I guess I’m posting to vent and see if anyone has felt like this before. I feel like I may have been able to achieve better entrepreneurship and financial independence with GI instead of cardiology. \n\nEdit: Thanks for everyone’s input! Really opened my eyes! ",

People who do ns, ortho, IC, GS, etc have a passion in their field, money is prob the 2nd or 3rd factor. If its your first factor going into cards then you need reevaluate your standing in cards and medicine in general. You will make plenty of $$ in medicine irrespective of your field. The worst thing you can do for yourself is to finish something which you dont like bc thats a road for misery lifelong not only for you but more importantly for your patients. \n\nYes GI makes more some places…so what.? NS makes more. Admins make more sitting twiddling their thumbs and telling us what to do.. \n\nYou are in first year and shouldn’t be worried about $$ right now and looking at what others make. Cardiology is one of the most demanding jobs out there bc our patients are sick and require immediate attention in most cases when every other specialty has run out of ideas.\n\nGive it time and you’ll either realize that you start to love cards or you are miserable. If its the latter then dont finish and find an alternative path bc thats neither good for your health nor the patients. \n\nFrom personal experience, i can tell you, I make just as much or more than my GI colleagues but thats doesn’t matter. What matters is the amount of people i have been able to help whether its by stemis, making their heart recover from 10% to 60% heart, etc. i dont think that satisfaction would ever be matched by anything else i would have done or made millions in business or wall street. \n\nDoing medicine is a privilege and you absolutely deserve to make good money at it. A difference of 300k or 400k/year over lifetime wont make a difference in your life. \n I hope you seriously have some self reflection about this. Cardiology is a great field!",

If theyre paying you that much you're expected to bring a ton of value in return for the practice/hospital system and be a top producer/revenue generator (which by the way can put you into government scrutiny). Those GI doctors making a million a year are likely a factory line of colonoscopies without much break during those days plus seeing a ton of patients in the office. Theyre hustling to make that money. There may be exceptions but exceptions dont disprove the rule. \n\nHaving said all that, cardiology often ranks among top 3-5 highest paying specialties among all fields. Cardiac procedures are being moved into outpatient settings also including cardiac ACS/office based labs in many states so this is literally just the beginning for cardiology. No one understands the heart and everyone is afraid of it so demand and job security will always be there.

My program is a community program without a cath lab and we don’t see STEMI patients or manage very complex cardiac for post PCI patients here.  I have arranged away elective to the hospital that has cath lab and advanced cardiac ICU for me to have some exposure. I will have 3-4 research projects published hopefully by next year and i am aiming for mainly community program. Not very competitive programs as it would be impossible with my limited cardiac exposure. We have 4 cardiologist here in the hospital who are very great people and will provide me with good LORs. I will also apply very broadly as I dont want to restrict myself to location or anything. We all know it is very competitive but How doable you guys think it is for me as a young female, very passionate about cardio, not restricted to location or area, with strong 4 LORs to match into cardiology.\nIs it even doable or should i just wait and build more connections and stronger CV and apply after a year or two? Also I have a green card. no visa issues. Thanks",

I have co-fellows that matched from community IM programs as well.\n\nMany trainees are obsessed with academic powerhouse institutions and such for cardiology, but to be honest my community program trains very solid cardiologists.

This can be in-person, virtual or recorded.  I was able to go in person (on scholarship) my first year of fellowship and it did more for me than any book has.

On the other hand, those other things take a lot of time. You usually don’t have to dedicate much time to them per day, but you need to be working on them for months to get anywhere. So start with the big difficult things, and do your reading when there is spare time. Then, just read the guidelines from all the professional society (SCCT, ACC, HRS, etc). Hope that helps.",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nNewly grad from a good academic institution; I am starting as a hospitalist. During residency I wanted to become EP, but was also debating for other social issues (visa etc), and was overwhelmed a bit with everything. I had some research and have good connections, the hospital I am at, and the city I am in have good cardio and EP fellowships, even combined cards-EP.  Though, they won't take visa-bearing candidates.  \n  \nI think I had a strong foundation to apply fellowship at the time, and now kind of regretting that I haven't applied. Though, part of me happy that I will become a perm resident, will have a good financial cushion and will have the time to build the perfect knowledge base/research and connections.\n\nMy only concern is that I am getting old, now I am 29 y/o, and by the time I complete my waiver I will be 32, and if I do cards+EP; by the time I am free, I will be close to my 40s. Not sure, if that will be too late to go into the attending life, how was your experience?\n\nThank you! In another post, I will ask recommendations for reading!",

My institution has (at least) one fellow who is in his 40s. You are not old.  When I was in fellowship, my best bud was another fellow who was late 30s (39?) when he finished his super-fellowship.

The former suggesting there’s volume overload and the latter identifying structural abnormalities, whether systolic or diastolic or valvular or whatever that may or may not lead to CHF or low output heart failure.\n\nCardiopathy can recover or revert due to exposure to toxins, stressors  (e.g. sepsis), status of disease, volume decompensation (i.e. chf) etc. this can lead to changes in LV size that can alter chest x-ray findings\n\nDecades of research on neurohormonal antagonism show that these medication’s work and that coming off them can lead to regression (TREDHF). As noted above this patient may have been exposed to toxins, repetitively like alcohol and then abstained or merely stop taking their medication and got back on it after a hospitalization. Not uncommon.\n\nLastly, wonderful job as a medical student digging in and doing your own evaluation and making observations. This is what distinguishes doctors from mid levels. You are going to make a great doctor from this alone. I hope you get to do research too. Seems like you are making observations and asking questions - prime ingredients for research",

    "selftext": "I am a long time acute care physical therapist.  In previous hospitals I have worked in our department has typically seen these patients when 1) The diagnosis of IE has been made 2) Infectious disease started IV antibiotics and 3) cardiology and CVS has weighed in also and patient is hemodynamically stable and needs PT for recommendations and address mobility concerns becomes a priority .  OR patient has completed all IV therapy outside of the hospital and returns for definitive surgical management and we see them post -op. When I have seen acute cases with emergent surgery they are a sick group and typically very weakened\n\nI know high mortality can be seen in IE. I also know it can be muddy getting to the diagnoses (Maybe I am wrong about this)\n\nHere is my concern about care of these patients and how they are managed and my role as a PT in a hospital where we may get a PT order sooner than expected from my previous experience with this population.\n\nAt anytime are these patients placed on bedrest with just bathroom privileges prior to definitive management?\n\nThis is my example from a recent patient:. 50ish year old guy with no past medical history is diagnoses on admission with sepsis. So far EKG is only showing sinus tachy and BPs are stable and he is on room air. At this time much is unknown as ID work up goes. He is on IV antibiotics ( I do not what) Day 2 PT is ordered because he is weak.  We see him and basic moving around in his room he doesn't need any help.  We walk him in the hall and monitored vitals. persistently tachy and easily exhausted.  Day 3 there is more concern for IE. Cardiology weighs in and echo showed decreased EF (35%) and concern for valve issues at aorta.  It is on Day 3 that I see him. Previous days of walking with PT he declined in distance to about 25 ft, tachy and starting to get confused.  More concern for IE and he tests positive for Lyme, blood culture done but no result. ID did not think Lyme was cause of endocarditis but certainly complicates his presentation. He is scheduled for TEE on the day I am to see him.  I plan to see him much later after tests and sedation, with hopes I have the results. I am concerned about seeing this man.  \n\nI go to his room to speak with him and his nurse in the room. He says strange things but is oriented.  I ask him if feels OK and still feeling any effects of sedation from TEE. He is not sure. He is comfortable but resting at 120. Pallor. BP soft. Nurse is addressing. My gut was thinking something is just NOT right here. Nurse tells me he has been saying bizarre tangential things since the morning before TEE. He said his ankles are swollen because of his heart.  He is on lasix.  I decide to HOLD therapy due to increased confusion and persistent tachycardia and borderline BP and no results from TEE. I sent message to hospitalist if this is IE can I safely work with him with suboptimal stability with IE. It was end of day. I did not here back. I document the visit and plan for next PT visit to monitoring very closely and consider HOLD PT until clarification.  Later I see the results of TEE suggesting mobile masses on 3 valves: Tricuspid, mitral, Aorta with severe stenosis and largest mass and moderately severe mitral valve regurgitation.(No known previous heart studies). This is a weekend. So not sure if the timing of the consult.\n\nDoes 3 valve involvement change the algorithm for treating or ambulating this patient? Is multi valve IE common?\n\nShould mobility be restricted at anytime during this work up? \n\nI return to my regular position in ICU.  He was transferred down the evening before for closer monitoring, pressor support and 2 L O2. He was seen by PT both days I was gone and more confusion, not able to do much and PT stopped the session almost immediately and communicated this to RN. The medical team wanted him to continue PT apparently. I am to just check on him in ICU by talking to RN for clarity. Patient is alert and moving about in room with staff. CVS is now consulting (Day 7) and considering emergent surgery. My plan was to HOLD therapy indefinitely and inform team why.\n\nHe goes into respiratory and then cardiac arrest and dies about 5 minutes after I arrive on the unit (it was a very long Code) . I was just about to speak to his nurse to check on him. CVS had just finished their consult in wee am hours and were planning for surgery the same day. \n\nAgain in previous acute settings PT is not seeing these patients typically until there is a clear treatment plan. It would have been my plan to hold all therapy until we are needed. We stopped mobility with ANY signs of intolerance. I do not feel that PT was truly indicated at this time in his admission. I do appreciate the seriousness of this condition.\n\nIf folks can point me to resources on the acute management of IE I would appreciate it.  I am also reaching out to PTs with more expertise in this area too. From my PT lit search there very little info on this condition pre-operatively regarding mobility besides our regular precautions. However it seems they can go south very quickly as this poor man did.\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\n\n\n\n\nTL/Dr. Guidance on mobility management of acute sepsis from endocarditis  in patient who is declining .

The number of valves involved does not matter, but the severity of the valve lesions can matter a lot.  A vegetation (infection) on a valve is concerning but does not necessarily cause immediate problems for a patient.  When it impairs valve function, causes ongoing sepsis/infection or embolizes, that is a more urgent condition. \n\nThis patient has a few red flags that justify your recommendation to defer PT.  Confusion in an IE patient is not normal and likely represents either septic emboli to the brain or a systemic process (such as sepsis or shock).  Either of these are concerning enough to not exercise the patient. \n\nAdditionally, hemodynamics instability in an IE patient is concerning as is a reduced EF.  Either of these conditions imply that the IE is complicated by severe valve dysfunction, septic shock, embolization or stress/taketsubo cardiomyopathy.  Any of these situations are more urgent/critical and should prompt a hold on PT activities such as ambulation. Generally, these patients need urgent or semi-urgent procedures and.",

Also, did the patient have other symptoms of Embolism, tachy is 1 but not typically reported unless paired with erratic respiration and breathing characteristics, typically when the charge nurse is notified prior to the Doc on amion. The Left sided concerns would be priority, according to step 1, (trying to understand how the surgical team would sort patients on acuity) but with so many varying symptoms, was a sepsis alert started? Would Heprin have been started to prepare for surgery and wouldn’t that worsen the tachycardia, so gradually introduction at a lower infusion rate take priority to get the patient to the OR?

I’ve called the hospital debriefing line before, and while it helps, it’s only about 50% effective personally.\nYour case brought back memories of a male patient, mid 40s with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and an Onyx valve placed in his 30s. He developed IE after a dermatology procedure infection eventually led to sepsis. He collapsed at a neighbor’s house and was brought in febrile, tachycardic, and septic. Dx with IE… The same CV surgeon operated on him both times. initially as a younger surgeon and a decade later. The second procedure replaced the vegetated valve with a St. Jude valve. I remember the patient said the surgeon being in the ICU nearly every morning the time he was left open for 72 hours (1st procedure) suture failure in Onyx.\nIronically, I had the same diagnosis (BAV) and consulted with the same surgeon for a David procedure (the surgeon never visited me in the ICU but Anesthesia did as I was a straight forward case, like textbook easy).\nIf a patient is not working with PT, then charting incentive spirometer capacity is mandatory and CO2 output and tidal volume recording is ordered, but that is more so for sickle cell pain crisis inpatient cards. In cards I used to feel so at ease and after my own heart surgery I subconsciously began matching my breathing pattern to the patient’s, probably to distract myself from heart palpitations since I was only 12 weeks out, and needed distractions. But mirroring the patients breathing extremely messed with my head, it did help once for a patient with some exotic tropical viral infection 39-40 RR and I had palpitations just watching him struggling to breathe, alerted his team, called a rapid, and he was taken quickly to the ICU when his test results came back. I don’t know if it’s possible to ask for a case review for educational learning if that will make you feel more at ease.

Specifically you asked about critical care, transplant, echo training. Short answer: no, community programs are not the same as academics.\n\nThe community programs operate like a private practice, so you’ll have very little access to transplant (I believe Christ is the only “transplant” hospital, and even then, they’re more of a VAD mill).\nSimilarly, ICU is disjointed in most community hospitals, whereas in most academic programs it operates more like a closed unit. And the best cardiology critical care exposure will come at transplant centers, because those are the places that get the shock patients for transplant evaluation.\n\nEven if you want to be a community doc with only outpatients, a more rigorous and varied training program will make you a better doctor.\n\nIf you’re asking whether the community cares programs are just as good as the academic ones, they’re not. For the reasons mentioned above.\n\nThat said, if you have a choice between. Community cards fellowship or none at all, well, the choice is obvious.",

I’m at an academic center in Philly but part of our training is rotation at a community hospital the flagship hospital bought out.\n\nAt the community hospital there’s no interventional fellows, only Attendings. My second month of cath as a first year fellow I was crossing lesions, ballooning, deploying stents. I did a whole lot more on that rotation than my cath month at the academic center. Where essentially all I got to do was get access ( and even then the IC fellow would rush me or take over if they thought I was moving too slow). Outside of flushing catheters or prepping the balloons all I did was the TR band and the dreaded holding pressure for fem arterial access.\n\nSame with TEEs as the community program. We were expected to set up the machine and have the probe in and have 2 chamber view ready to go by the time the attending walked in.\n\nAt my academic place we had advanced imaging fellows who always got first dibs for the TEE. You were relegated to pushing buttons if lucky, or writing the notes of unlucky.\n\nFor EP at the community program I scrubbed into pacemaker cases, aflutter ablation. At my academic program you don’t ever scrub into EP cases.\n\nThere’s a lot more autonomy and just doing things at a community hospital.\n\nI agree you don’t see transplant, may not see ecmo, no advanced HF transplant modalities, probably no congenital cases. Which I do think hurts you if you ever run into those patients in your independent practice.\n\nBut to be real. If you’re interested in advanced HF and Pul HTN or congenital you need to do the super fellowship in it. Three years of gen cards isn’t enough.",

Our fellows graduate with COCATS Level 3 in most imaging modalities and perform hundreds of independent PCIs during their training. The absence of subspecialty fellows means more hands-on opportunities, which significantly strengthens your clinical and procedural skills as a general cardiologist.\n\nAs for transplant availability, if your goal is to practice general cardiology, this shouldn't be a concern. And if you're aiming to become a transplant cardiologist, you'd need to pursue an additional year of advanced heart failure training anyway, regardless of your general fellowship setting.\n\nJust focus into getting in a high volume center.",

        "body": "I'm not a doc, I'm an NP. But I can tell you a few things that my doc greatly appreciates. \n\n- Giving report should be no more than a 30 second affair. Cut to the chase already, nobody cares about the patient's dog or exactly which restaurant they started having chest pain at. Keep it clean, keep it simple\n\n- Take as much off of his or her plate as possible. At the end of the day, our role is to extend the amount of work they're able to shoulder by cutting back on the busywork. Pick the low-hanging fruit. Interpret the labs, read the holter/ambulatory monitor reports, check the inboxes for stupid stuff, direct the staff to refill maintenance meds and whatnot. Leave your number with the nurses at the hospitals you consult at and encourage them to call you directly instead of reaching out to your SP, especially during clinic hours. Nothing aggravates my doc more than getting trivial questions or notifications that somebody else can handle. Triage that junk and only escalate the stuff that really needs physician attention. \n\n- Know the guidelines inside and out. You're a year in now, your doc is going to expect you to be able to manage most things yourself. Consider sitting for the CCKE. Stay up to date on changes in practice. Being able to stand on your own two feet comes with time and experience, but you should be mostly independent when it comes to the day to day grind by now. But, don't be afraid to ask questions either. Just make sure you've exhausted your learning resources before you do. \n\n- Speaking of asking for help, come to your SP with plans and solutions, not problems. You're asking for assistance with your medical decision making, not completely offloading it. Approach with a format of \"I have X patient with Y problem, I'm thinking I could do Z but I wanted to seek your input before I do.\" This one goes a long way in my experience. \n\n- This may be extra and some would disagree, but try to have some understanding of what goes on with their schedule, even outside of work. If I know my SP has a jam-packed day of TEEs or whatever, I'll proactively round on the hospitalized folks even if he doesn't directly ask me to. If it's his wife's birthday and he's taking her out to dinner, I'm damn sure gonna have him out of the office by 5. That last patient was running late and it's gonna make him late for a special occasion? Get out of here dude, I got this (to be fair, he does this for me too).",

I know randomised data don’t really support this approach, but the number of times I saw a hypotensive patient in cardiogenic shock actually have an increase in MAP with nitroprusside was quite humbling (super high calculated SVR from PAC —&gt; start nitroprusside —&gt; MAP increases, patient warms up and starts making urine —&gt; filling pressures start coming down). We also saw a lot of valvular disease contributing to the picture, so unique maneuvers to manage that were also very helpful (eg IABP for severe MR, TVP and pacing for severe AI, metoprolol for severe MS, etc). Because of department leadership, we were very skeptical of inotropes.",

But after seeing it work again and again during fellowship, I’m now a believer in nitroprusside. It’s because the mechanism of hypotension in cardiogenic shock is not vasoplegia, it’s low cardiac output. If the degree of increase in CO outpaces the degree of decrease in SVR, MAP goes up. We used to call this phenomenon “afterload mismatch,” because the high SVR was so maladaptive. Same reason I give diuretics to volume overloaded patients with hypotension, because diuretics cannot cause hypotension in volume replete patients.

I'd ensure someone is naming an indication. If you can only get the PA and they don't give an indication that makes sense then ask them to clarify with an indication somewhere in their documentation because from the information you have it's not indicated. Gonna be real, never seen this charted before but perhaps there's some nuance missing, or some history that was found through some correspondence that's gone missing or something the patient said verbally. Maybe some TTE results suggested heart failure idk.\n\n\nA lot of doctors now consider evidence that stopping Metformin around angiograms is not necessary btw.

Being the only doctor in the icu where everything happens so quickly, you must know the solution almost subconsciously to almost any problem you are about to face.\n\nSo, what would be your recommendations? How was it for you back then? What are the must know things to manage the icu and where to learn more about them, not asking like just reading in a textbook, you should read this 1500 page intubation book, but more like everyday use knowledge? \n\n  \nLike acute arrythmia management, hypertensive pulmonary edema, arrest protocols, managing according to abg, mechanical ventilation etc etc you name it. What are the must know things to manage the icu to a certain level according to your experience?",

Don’t worry about impressing people, being the best in your cohort, never looking the fool, etc.  You will never have another time in your life where you will have access to so much clinical learning nor will you ever have another time where the opportunity cost of learning is so low.  Take advantage of it. \n\nDon’t just learn the thought process of managing patients (which is extremely important and valuable in its own right), but also specific skills (TEE, nuclear, cath, interventions, etc.).  This isn’t just for “the love of learning”: These things all have potential to make your patients healthier, your professional life more fulfilling, your schedule easier and your bank account larger.  \n\nThat being said, I also think it is important to continue to invest in your own health, relationships and spirituality.  If you don’t have an exercise habit in fellowship, it’s harder to pick it up later on. Don’t fail your loved ones or abandon your faith.  Obviously, that means you will give up *some* learning opportunities.  Choose wisely.  There is still plenty of time to have a great life in most fellowship programs.  Just don’t waste time.",

GDMT is so good that most heart failure is essentially curable today. Transplant/VAD numbers are flat. There really isn't a huge population of advanced CHF and most patients with advanced CHF are elderly anyways. There's not really an epidemic of heart failure out there. If you look at the numbers beyond the headlines, ICD deaths are down, pump failure deaths are down, so exactly how are these patients dying? It's from other causes, which obviously CHF makes worse, but transplant/vad won't make them better.\n\nThe best data that demonstrates heart failure is bullshit, IMO, is ROADMAP. Advanced CHF but class 3b, not 4, in the heartmate 2, and there was no mortality benefit. So if treating these fairly advanced, fairly symptomatic patients with advanced therapies doesn't result in a mortality benefit, it shows actually how benign a disease like CHF is. And this is before our current modern therapy, you could argue that ROADMAP today would find harm, as GDMT is better but the device isn't that much better, though CHF docs like to taut it is. MOMENTUM 3 demonstrated less pump thrombosis, but similar rates of bleed, stroke, infection, etc, and no mortality benefit. If you ran ROADMAP today, it'd be a trial that finds harm instead given how much better GDMT is today vs in early 2000s.\n\nFinally, you limit yourself to mostly academic centers if you want the full spectrum of CHF. That's a 50% paycut. You can't pay your bills in prestige. I made partner this year in our group, and it's like 750k plus rvu bonuses plus quality bonuses. Not unusual to make a million if you hustle, and most docs make 800k in our group.",

There is a higher amount of flow into the lung circulation which distends the pulmonary arteries and can lead to pulmonary hypertension over time. If significant pulmonary hypertension has developed, closing the VSD  can lead to RV failure. The left ventricle has the “option” of pumping blood against aortic pressure or against a lower right ventricular pressure with an open VSD. This means more volume is required to maintain forward LV stroke volume. At the time of VSD closure, LV function can get temporarily worse given the loss of the low pressure RV outlet but over time the function improves as positive remodeling happens with less preload and LV distension. \n\nHemodynamically, acute VSDs should be closed as soon as possible, unfortunately, in certain situations like post-MI, the tissue is friable and the size of the hole isn’t clear yet, so patching early is often ineffective.",

        "body": "We see VSRs all the time. At the risk of being pedantic, it is a VSR (ventricular septal rupture), not a VSD (ventricular septal defect, which is congenital). The presentation can be variable depending on the size of the VSR and what else is going on with the patient (e.g. whether they have concomitant LV failure, ischemic MR, or something else). But often the presentation is sudden onset shock - evidence of poor perfusion, lactic acidosis, acute kidney/liver injury, delirium, weak pulses, skin mottling, etc. The LV’s output is going to the RV instead of into the aorta. Often these patients get pulmonary artery catheters placed for monitoring. Sometimes the PA catheter is already in place when the VSR happens. Don’t fall into the pitfall of misinterpreting a high mixed venous as evidence of distributive/septic shock - it reflects L to R shunting in these cases.\n\nIn terms of management, definitive treatment consists of closing the VSR. However, sewing a patch into acutely infarcted myocardium is very tricky - one of the surgeons I work with describes it as “trying to stitch into hamburger meat.” Retrospective studies show that people who are taken to the OR 5-10 days after their VSR tend to do better than the ones taken immediately. These data are obviously full of confounds (maybe the ones taken immediately were sicker to begin with?) but the idea still impacts practice. Some of these patients actually have a normal blood pressure, and we can stabilize them by giving afterload reduction to the LV (we often use sodium nitroprusside), which lowers the shunt fraction. However, many patients with a VSR are hypotensive. For the hypotensive patients with VSR, we often place an Impella 5.5, which pulls the blood from the left ventricle into the aorta instead of letting it go into the right ventricle. That helps restore some hemodynamics and buy time for the patient’s infarct to finish scarring, at which point it is more technically feasible to repair the rupture with a patch. Of course Impella’s come with their own host of complications, but that’s a totally different topic.\n\nMy personal experience with trying to close these things percutaneously is that plugs don’t work very well - there’s always a little leak, which has a high velocity due to the pressure differential between the LV and the RV cavities, and then patients develop hemolysis and all kinds of issues. The unfortunate truth is that many of these people still die, whether they get surgery or not - recall that, globally, the mortality from acute MI with cardiogenic shock is still over 50%.",

I currently read 24/48 hour holter monitors and perform treadmill stress test (with the cardiologist present). Does anyone know of any programs in SoCal that would help me be better equipped for this exam? Everything I find online is either for a Cardiovascular Tech, or is out of state/country.

    "selftext": "Pgy1 here hoping to pursue cardiology. Specifically drawn to it because of the procedural + interventional component… since first day in the cath lab as a student and I was hooked. \n\nRecent years have seen a shift in the interventional landscape. More stringent tightening of indications for revascularisation/stents particularly in stable angina, improvements in cardiac CT potentially reducing volume of diagnostic caths etc. I understand structural has a bright future but there doesn’t seem to be enough volume to go around anyway. Either way everything seems to be pointing to less time in the Cath lab, with a greater emphasis on non-invasive imaging, emerging medical therapeis, clinic etc.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on where all this will take interventional cardiology in the future? Specifically, do you think the average interventionalist will get less and less procedural as volume declines and there’s less work to go around? I know it’s impossible be definitive, but just seeking opinions on where the field seems to be heading\n\n(Had posted on r/residency but was advised would be better to post here :))\n\nEDIT: thanks all for the replies. I should add I’m an Aussie pgy1, compensation is a little different to you guys. Not much money in STEMI call down here. Our reimbursements mainly come from elective caths (stents + diagnostic) in the private system. Because of this our interventionalists who have long elective lists also earn significantly more than non-procedural counterparts. If based on the comments, elective caths will largely disappear with only STEMI call left, not a good sign for us down under ",

Mainly because the pay is about the same for a much better lifestyle. They also have families and spending possibly 2 more years in training didn't seem like a good idea. \nI myself am an EP and constantly fighting burnout but not because of the work - I love EP - but mostly because of where our healthcare system is going. The ranks of admins are growing rapidly and a lot of money being spent in their salaries and benefits. They in turn have to justify their existence so come up with new \"metrics\" that add more non medical work and pressure on physicians. \nI agree with others that STEMI call will always be needed so there will always be jobs. I think after 15 or so years in practice it gets quite old being on q3 or q4 call even if you don't get called in. \nIf you have family or plan to have one please keep in mind that the quality of life will be gained from spending time with your family and not from spending time on the job or on call.",

        "body": "Honestly, the future does not look great in my opinion. Trials like COURAGE, ISCHEMIA, BCIS-REVIVED have shown that medical management of stable CAD is non-inferior to an invasive strategy. For this reason, a lot of patients are not even coming to the cath lab anymore. Their general cardiologists are “medically managing” their obstructive CAD which is diagnosed by non-invasive methods (i.e., stress treating or coronary CTA). With everyone on statins, incidence of ACS is declining. The patients that do finally show up to the cath lab are often 80+ years old and have a million co-morbidities and horrible, calcified multivesssel CAD that the surgeons will not touch. Then you find yourself discussing either high risk PCI or hospice.\n\nLike you alluded to, there is not enough structural volume to go around. Structural fellowships are going unfilled for this reason. If you can get peripheral trained and find a gig that allows you to do peripheral work, this will augment your case volume. However, prepare to move somewhere relatively remote (i.e., not near a big city) if you want to do this because in most major hospitals vascular surgery/IR does all of the peripheral work.\n\nWith catheter-based therapies for acute PE and renal denervation gaining momentum (mostly from device company propaganda), there is some hope that these procedures will increase volume. But overall, the volume (and pay) is nothing like what it was say 20 years ago.\n\nI think there will always be a job market (again, perhaps more so in less desirable geographical locations) because despite declining numbers, STEMIs will still occasionally happen, and STEMI capable hospitals will always need ICs to take call. However, a lot of jobs out there basically have you work as a general cardiologist that takes STEMI call.\n\nIn summary, I hope I am wrong, but I do not think the future looks good for the field.",

This seems to be a recurring question and I am going to give it a go.\n\nWhile regional variations exist, some of the other comments seem generalizations, well intended but do not seem to reflect what we and colleagues in other places are currently seeing. My impression in no particular order:\n\n\\- No cardiology field is being compensated as it was 20 yrs ago.\n\n\\- Do NOT do IC for the money. Having said that, it still it being paid more than gen cards. Depending on the practice model, a lot more. This may not apply to you ‘down under’, but for the US, you may google MedAxiom to give you an idea\n\n\\- Almost by definition, call frequency will be more as a practice is likely to have a base of gen card APPs and MDs and subspecialty smaller group of IC and EP docs. On the other hand, as there is a shortage of IC, STEMI call only is relatively common.\n\n\\- I would \\*personally\\* much rather be on call for STEMI than for gen card. Yes, it is more life disruptive but after &gt;10 yrs of practice I still enjoy the thrill of the acuity of cases, the challenge of the unexpected, the incredible enjoinment that comes from using your skills to literally defeat death and see the results right there and then. Few specialties offer the satisfaction, immediacy, and rewards (but also the stakes and risks) that IC does.\n\n\\- Many IC docs retired during COVID and the current graduate output has been unable to meet demand. We are a collegial in a large very desirable metro area, offering above average initial guaranteed compensation for 2 yrs, very little turnover and are having a challenge recruiting a good IC for an open spot.\n\n\\- The structural field is not what it was and there seems to be saturation. That is likely a function of how popular it has been last few yrs, that 1-2 structural docs can serve the needs of even a large group and that not every hospital is capable of having a structural dept.\n\n\\- Vascular is in increasing demand as it does not require the investment that a structural program does and there continues to be a broadening of treatment areas, PE, DVTs, venous, renal denervation.\n\n\\- As opposed to gen card there is (so far) less encroachment / replacement risk by AI and/or APPs.\n\n\\- The above applies to non-academic IC. I tried academia for a yr and that is another different beast. I am not sure I would recommend IC in an academic setting. In my brief experience, it seemed underpaid and overworked and having fellows did not lessen the burden as I still needed to be directly involved. Plus the pressures of publication, grants, etc.\n\nUltimately, if you need to be convinced to do IC… don’t. Do what you love. I go to work feeling that they pay me to do what I love. Hope that helps and Godspeed on whatever you choose.",

        "body": "Fellow at big workhorse Philly program.\n\n1. IC is saturated. The vast majority of IC jobs you will be doing a lot of general cardiology work and taking a lot of general cardiology call. That's on top of IC call/STEMI call. The IC grads this year at my program all had a difficult time finding a job in a location of their preference along with the job entailing what they wanted. All of them are doing general cardiology work on top of IC responsibilities. \n2. Two-three full days in the lab is probably the best you're going to get. Our most senior and well known interventionalist at my program has 4 lab days split between peripherals, coronaries and structural. And one full clinic day. All the other IC guys have 2.5 lab days max.\n3. Going back to saturated, big metropolitan areas will be saturated with IC. They will still work you for a lower salary for that area think NYC/SF/LA/Philly/. You'll likely have to read echos, nucs, general call and IC.  \n4. Structural is even more saturated. TAVR, TEER and TVVR are all still in their growing years. TAVR is the oldest and onyl about 15 years popular. All those attendings who were in training when TAVR came out are still practicing and in their primes. They do not want to give up these structural procedures which often have high RVUs. In order to do structural you'll have to go somewhere rural and build a program up yourself (and in turn overwork yourself), or be 2nd operator under someone who will allow you to build your base. And even then you may be 2nd operator for 10+ years before getting to run the show solo.\n5. Ah you may then think you should diversify your skills with peripheral interventions, PFO/VSD closures, PE interventions etc. The RVUs for these procedures given their time, complexity and risks are not worth it IMO. It may be your niche if you truly LOVE interventional but it makes no economic sense.\n6. Think of the effect on your body. Wearing lead so frequently. Numerous IC docs I know have back issues. I know some who have had back surgery, herniated disks, some with severe spinal issues they require fusion. \n7. Think of the effects on your body taking STEMI call. No post call days for attendings. There's no other fellow to cover you if a STEMI one night turns into a complicated case requiring support. Your STEMI went from midnight to 5am? Well no sense in going back home, might as well start your day at the hospital or clinic when the case is done. Waking up all those nights, long hours will also take it's toll on your body.\n7. Think about family. You want to miss your pee-wee kid's soccer final on the weekend because 92 year old mee-mawh had a STEMI and family wants everything done? Your daughter's violin recital on a Wednesday night because the left main you thought didn't need support is crashing and needed an emergent balloon pump? You and your spouse haven't been able to take a good long vacation in years because you're need for STEMI call and no one else can cover?\n8. More and more studies are showing we don't need to stent every lesion. Outside of STEMI, nothing needs to immediately be stented. Even NSTEMI you can medically manage for 48 hours and bring them back later. Stable CAD is a no-no. No benefit in CTO lesions other than a 4 hour time sink for penny's for RVUs. \n\nIf there's anymore I can think of I'll edit the post. Again, I'm just a fellow, but I have seen the IC attendings and fellows work at my program. All of our IC fellows have told me they regretted IC after the year of fellowship. They just fell in love with the instantaneous adrenaline rush of access, engaging, crossing the lesion, ballooning, stenting, ballooning and that TIMI III flow. They didn't think of how it would be day after day of this. All of them struggled to find jobs and had to give up something (location, salary, scope). \n\nDon't get me wrong. From 8am to about 3pm on a M-F I love the cath lab. It's fun to get access, if you have a good cath lab nursing staff with music and food on friday's it's a good time. The first time as a first year the attending let me deploy that stent and i saw that \"chefs kiss\" TIMI III flow when I cine'd it was a rush like I've never felt before.  But I've dealt with enough 3am middle of the night STEMIs, activating the lab, getting the patient on the table and then 4-5 hours of mechanical support, difficult lesions to cross, dissected arteries etc for me to say \"yup not for me\".\n\nThink long and hard about IC. The only two interventional fellows that I've met on my journey who truly love it live, breathe and sleep IC. They would rather be in the cath lab than on a beach in Hawaii. Rather be in the cath lab than at their mother's birthday dinner. The cath lab fulfills something for them nothing else does. And even then, I've seen them on tough days regretting the decision.",

            "body": "I mostly disagree with this.  To your points…\n\n1. It’s not completely saturated.  In most practices, the model has changed and IC is a mix of gen cards and IC.  This is because (a) reimbursement for cath lab ain’t what it used to be and (b) we want to have pleas call burden.\n\n2. See comment 1.  You can definitely still find jobs where you spend half or most time in the lab.  These jobs tend not to be in more “desirable” locations.  Keep in mind, if you are getting half of the cath lab volume, you are probably on call Q2 as well. \n\n3. The salary thing is true of every medical specialty.  Reading these other studies is a good thing to do. It is probably the highest reimbursement-to-time ratio activity in cardiology.  Even if you are in the lab 80% of the time, you want to read echos if you can.\n\n4. Mostly correct. Structural is more saturated than IC in general.  These are elective or semi-elective cases..so there isn’t a need for a larger call pool to handle them.  Jobs aren’t as easy to come by. \n\n5. These procedures are not all the same.  PFO closure is super simple and reimburses well for the time. The problem with structural is with finding the volume of patients not already spoken for (as you pointed out in 4).  For endovascular (PAD, etc) there is less cardiology saturation, but you do compete with IC and/ or vascular.  \n\n6. I think this is over-blown. Most people are not in the lab 5 days a week.  You need to be aware of posture,etc.   back problems are common, even if you don’t do IC.  This is what someone says when they are trying to talk themselves out of IC.\n\n7. This is the second point that I think has some validity.  STEMI can mess with your sleep schedule.  However,  most of us follow that model where we do general cardiology as well and don’t take so much call that this is a deal breaker. \n\n8. True.   Being on call takes sacrifices.  Sometimes it’s frustrating.  I think it’s okay to miss a violin recital to save someone’s life, though.  As stated above, it’s not difficult to find opportunities where you are not on call too too often.  In larger groups, finding someone to cover call for vacation is not that difficult. \n\n9. While it’s true that medical therapy can be very effective and the indications for PCI in SIHD have shrank, this isn’t really a new thing.  There is  also a lot more nuance to it than your comment acknowledges.\n\n\nOverall, you should realize that most interventional cardiology jobs are not what they once were decades ago. Interventional cardiologist in the United States and many other places are no longer full-time proceduralists.  More often, they are cardiologists that see all types of cardiology patients have a special skill set for procedures when needed. This change is not necessarily for the worst. It does mean less call. It also means more diverse sources of RVUs and more patient ownership, both of which can be important professionally.  You can definitely still find jobs that are mostly procedural.  However, just like with any other highly specialized or highly desirable practice in medicine, these jobs are not as common and sometimes require you to make sacrifices and pay or location.\n\nThis post, and the post by OP, both very much sound like people trying to talk themselves out of becoming interventional cardiologists. If that is where your mind is, it might not be the best field for you. If you really do think it’s exciting to be in the Cath Lab and it’s something that you would enjoy having as part of your career, consider that I see training is typically only about one year. It’s very possible to do the training and then decide not to be an interventional cardiologist and practice if the other factors are so important to you. Obviously, this does not happen very often. The reason for that is because most people find that it is desirable to continue practicing interventional cardiology. There is a bigger need right now for general cardiologists than there is for Interventional cardiologists, so no one is going to force you to practice IC.",

        "body": "So I’m an interventionalist, who learned to do legs a bit in fellowship, but really learned my first 2 years in practice.  Nobody was wanting to do them, so my leg practice got huge.  My group was able to start an OBL and financially this was the best part of my career. I was the president of the OBL and the group after the original guy retired.  We each had a day in the OBL and my salary doubled.  I made more money doing legs for 4 hours on a Tuesday than everything else combined.   And I’m nuke and echo boarded as well, which I would recommend in your training. General cardiology fellowship is where I got these obviously.  \n\nThen the hospital hires a vascular surgeon who was just going to be a surgeon (not gonna do percutaneous stuff) but that’s not how it went down. They also purchased the surgical group (wound care) and some of the podiatrist groups.  They seemed to have mandated that all referrals go to her the vascular surgeon, and volumes went way down.  I stayed full, doing 4-5 outpatient cases a week, but everyone else dried up.  We split things 60/40, meaning in the OBL 40 goes to the operator 60 to the group.  So I’m basically paying their overhead, which is frustrating..\n\nFast forward we started working with a PE group and were going to move forward, would have been very nice on the front end.  And they were going to ensure we got an ASC, which is hard in my state, and PET/CT, which would have been great.  My one partner tanked the deal, and we ended up doing a deal with the hospital, not my first choice.  My starting salary is nice, but there’s a big possibility for RVU bonus (theoretically, hasn’t happened yet.)   The reason for the shift was increased overhead and decreased reimbursement every year.  It just wasn’t sustainable.   In the OBL during the good days, my charges averaged 120k for just 4-5 cases.  Sometimes as much as 200k.  (This is not collections but charges).  But that’s gotten near impossible with Humana and United health rejecting everything especially btk stuff with nonhealing wounds.\n\nSo moving forward, there’s no real difference between the OBL and the Cath lab, financially speaking. I try to keep simple cases in the OBL, because patients prefer it, but even complex cases seem to go better there, because we have the best techs and up until now paid them very well.  The hospital will dictate that now.   I have regrets every day, but this is just one ICs story.   I’ve gotten offers do just do 100% outpatient legs in various OBLs for 900k, and I turned them down.  I don’t want to stop doing hearts, though legs are my passion.  In 3-4 months I’ll know how good or bad of a decision this was.  Oh and 3/7 of my partners quit, moved, or retired during this time.  I had said I’d never work for a hospital, but here I am.\n\nIn reality, there’s unlimited work here and I can be as busy as I want to be.  The volume is not necessarily going down if you’re nice to referring docs and not an asshole.   I know this is not true in big cities, and I’m in a fairly big college town.  But nothing like an actual big city.  I’ve been out of IC fellowship almost 11 years. And obviously I went straight through, so I’m mid 40s.",

Thinking about careers in addition to IC and wondering what people’s experiences are.\n\n**IC + critical care**: My understanding here is that cardiac critical care specialists are increasing in need/want. General cardiologists “typically” don’t like their CCU time and being on call for sick patients. CCU patients are becoming more complex with medical comorbidities too. I like the ccu and sick patients but debating whether it’s worth an extra year.\n\n* does this sound accurate? Is there an increased pay incentive for these positions? Do employers even care? Does it give me more job flexibility / employability?\n\n**IC + PAD:** Another area that’s hard to quantify its eventual need/want. PAD has overlap with IR and Vascular with their procedures so it’s hard to build a PAD practice. Not even sure employment wise whether it’s desirable. I also like the sick PE patients but again it would have to be hospital dependent.\n\n* any current attendings with experience here? It generally feels like there aren’t a lot of opportunities. Not sure if there will be a shift towards more IC based PE teams but it makes sense medically (to me at least) bc cardiology knows how to treat these patients.",

They'll also do thrombectomies for PEs and angiovacs for endocarditis. Biopsy for myocarditis and periocardiocentesis. Essentially the mop man for everything else. \n\nFrom my experience as a general fellow in the cath lab I would stay far away from peripheral cases. They are messy and super long usually 4-5 hours with increasingly small RVU reimbursements. It's just not worth it. You are better served see clinic patients in the same amount of time you do a leg or a renal artery de-nervevation. And the complications with these leg patients are non stop. Dissected iliac, ischemic leg, perf'ed renal artery. Shit is not worth it at all. \n\nThose same interventionalist also take turns rounding on our CCU. I would also advise to avoid this. They still have cases during their CCU week. Often times half assed rounding with the fellow in between cases, but most of the time post 6pm. They also are very unhelpful. Yes they can put in the balloon pump, impella but they don't know what to do trouble shooting wise on day 2 of impella placement when there's persistent low flow alarms.\n\nAnd god forbid something non cardiac goes wrong with the patient like they need to be intubated or have an infection, us the fellows are on our own. Our interventionalist don't even have TEE privileges at our hospital so if someone has suspected endocarditis the fellow has to find a cardiologist with privileges willing to help out. \n\nYou need to do a devoted 1 year critical care fellowship if you want to do IC+CCU in order to learn the medicine critical care aspects. And even then, places are going to just dump more work on you. You're going to be rounding in the CCU while still having cases that week. It's unlikely you'll get an entire week off of the cath lab to just focus on the CCU. \n\nPeripheral cases are not even worth it IMO. \n\nJust advice as a general fellow but the way to go is coronaries, 2nd operator for structural cases and fill in the remaining time with general cardiology responsibilities such as clinic, echos and nucs. \n\nThat is the best bang for your buck. Ensure you're making a good amount without a needless amount of stress.",

In my/my friends recent job hunts people are desperate to hire ICs with peripheral skills, it’s considered a low risk money maker you can fill up your ASC with.

And that’s in hospitals that support a rounding cardiologist in the unit; in many of the other smaller hospitals patient goes to the ICU and you just round on them if it’s your patient or if you’re covering for the group, PCCM still primary. \n\nIn either of these scenarios I don’t really see a big need for additional training years unless you felt there were specific gaps you were trying to fill.

CCU will be primary from now on. \n\nI also feel the northeast cardiologist are more \"territorial\" and want to prove they can handle everything. That's why at my place the cardiologist want to stay primary on the CCU instead of making it strictly an ICU consult service. We tried that this year, but the faculty (and the ICU faculty) overwhelmingly all decided that cards would stay primary. \n\nOur CCU is usually staffed with our two ICs, advanced HF person and our one general cardiologist who has been working here for 25+ years and essentially taught himself critical care cardiology on the job. But the weeks when the IC are on and even the advanced HF guy, outside their scope they don't offer much. \n\nAnd our IC guys are always trying to ensure their cath days are booked.

There are very few places that require/expect CC training to attend on CCU and gen+IC fellowship will probably make you pretty comfortable with CCU.  There are also regions (the West Coast) where cards-CC fellowship has not caught on and/or is seen as a negative thing. \n\nAdding peripheral to IC is great if those patients and cases interest you a lot.  It may or may not help with productivity depending on how you choose your cases.  You'll have to work out local scope/ownership with the IR and vascular guys in your area, but it is very doable (and you can do it with other without another fellowship after IC).\n\nI generally agree with what u/groovitude313 shares.  When you add things on to a cardiology career, you have to make sure that you are doing it for a good reason.  Starting an invasive program for PE sounds cool, but it probably means a lot more call (and call that a hospital is not likely to reimburse you for).  Peripheral cases can be interesting but, unless you have a peripheral-enriched practice, it's hard to do them efficiently. Remember that productivity for sitting in clinic is fairly high...so adding extras on is typically something that you do because you enjoy it.",

The pay is MUCH better in private practice or a mixed model, and there are still many opportunities to engage in industry sponsored research and meaningfully contribute to the field.  At conferences, there is little difference between academic and private EP until you start to look at mechanistic/translational research.  Harder to study an animal model in private practice, etc.\n\nAcademic EP is wonderful, and I love it dearly.  That said, I recognize it's limitations and some days I feel a bit stifled.  Academic EP is useful for the following two priorities:  frequent teaching of residents/fellows and translational/clinical research that a company would be less likely to fund but the government might.\n\nTo answer your question, my week varies:  I do procedures 2-3 days per week, clinic 1 day per week, and research 1-2 days per week.  The breakdown changes week to week.  Your ability to protect your research time in academics is directly related to your research funding.  Your funding supports part of your salary, 'buying down' your clinical RVU requirements.  Some of us do more, some of us do less.  Some of us are all clinical (3 days in the lab, 1-2 days clinic/1 day admin).\n\n  \nI see many academic EPs start to specialize:  They either focus on very complex arduous procedures or the exact opposite.  Some things that are easier to do in an academic environment are the time intensive, arduous, less reimbursed procedures.  I get to do a lot of endo/epi VT ablation, for example.  The risk/reward and time commitment often isn't worth it in the private practice setting.\n\n  \nAnyway, EP is awesome.  You should keep exploring it!",

New to this community and seeking advice from the experts who know the space best. \n\nI have an offer at a reputable company as a sales rep for their lead extraction devices. \n\nI come from the world of disposables in the IR/Cath lab space and so don't have a large exposure to this procedure. I am curious about the nature of these lead extractions as case coverage will be a large part of the role.\n\nThis would be covering the mechanical sheaths used to extract the leads, locking stylets and snares. It also has some product for lead placement like catheters, working sheaths and even a transceptal needle for the EP side.\n\nNote: I would not be representing the actual pacemakers, ICDs or ablation catheters. \n\nMost important questions:\n\n1. Is this as dangerous, intense and long a procedure as some of the Reddit threads from patients make it out to be? 6-12 hour cases with potential for very negative outcomes?\n\n2. As a rep what will my role in the room most likely be for the physician and staff? If anyone scrubs these currently and has worked with a rep please let me know how they were involved. I want to know the honest truth about what I am getting into.\n\n3. Are these cases emergent? And if they are how much lead time is usually given?  \n\nTrying to get a feel for this before I move forward and there is only so much current reps at the company can and will divulge prior to accepting.\n\nThank you for your insights and time!\n\n\n",

Sometimes 6-7, but that is for more complex/very aged leads, usually with need to place a new CS lead following extraction or some other more niche procedure (SVC stent). \n\n2. Our reps advise on prepping and how to best utilize the tools they rep for. Reps are scrubbed in, but they come in and out of the case, hang out and socialize in the control room when not needed. \n\n3. No, these are not emergent cases. Can be urgent-ish, but the nuances of an extraction program can make it difficult to expedite cases. Some centers are better at expediting than others. If infection is the reason to extract, you want the leads out within 2 weeks.",

However if there is a cardiac perforation during something like an ablation often you would get away with just a pericardiocentesis and the patient will do well. If there is a SVC tear it requires emergency surgery and still the patient may not do well depending on their comorbidities. \n2. Your role as a rep will depend on the program. In my extraction cases the rep is never there as our team is well versed with the products available and  prep, proper workflows etc. The laser generator is quite easy to use. Testing of the equipment is done by a laser safety officer that is employed by the hospital. In a place where there is a lower volume, high staff turnover, or is a newer program you might be needed to cover cases to recommend the right tool or even for moral support to the physician 😁\n3. Almost never emergent, but can be urgent if the patient is septic from bacteremia related to a device infection. Most of those infected leads extract very easily though and in my experience I have rarely needed to struggle or even use extraction tools.",

So firstly, thank you to everyone.\n\nI am at the tail end of my first year of fellowship and confused about pursuing interventional cardiology. \nI have always wanted to pursue interventional ever since I had decided to be a cardiologist, but it’s only in the last few months that I have been having doubts about it, although I am still inclined more towards pursuing it than not.\n\nI really enjoy procedures and the critical nature of interventional along with the theoretical side of it too (although I do understand that this excitement fades away with time). I know IC earn more but there is also the opportunity cost of that 1 extra year of fellowship. And mainly the intense and consuming lifestyle of IC. I am starting to feel a little tired and drained out already at the end of my first year lol. \n\nI know it is going to be a personal decision in the end, but I would really appreciate any input/ advice from you all about the pros and cons that you see and how you made the decision in your own case.\n\n1. In terms of RVU compensation and earning difference between non invasive vs interventional\n2. How tough/easy it is to find an interventional job with a decent lifestyle balance?\n3. Job opportunities?\n4. If you could go back, would you change your decision of being a non invasive vs an interventionalist?\n\nThank you so much once again. And I apologize for the long post. ",

        "body": "1. Compensation will vary by group.  In my group, we (IC) are paid a little more per RVU than our gen cards colleagues.  However, this is not true in many (most?) groups.  There are some (increasingly rare) situations where IC get paid lots more than gen cards...but that is not common at all.  In general, a general cardiologist grinding through patients in clinic will earn more RVUs than an IC on a cath lab day...so they do have potential to earn more in many groups.\n2. Depends on what you consider a decent lifestyle balance.  I am on call Q5 and feel that lifestyle balance is okay.  Have done call as frequently as Q2 before.  I feel well with Q4 or less call, but become unhappy with anything more than that. Definitely easier to have more non-work life with general cardiology.\n3. It is more difficult to find an IC job than it is to find a job in general cardiology.  At my hospital, during the last 5 years, we have added 1 IC and 4 general cardiologists.  My group is hiring a general cardiologist and we get about 2 ICs applying for every general cardiologist applying (we are not hiring IC now). However, there are still jobs available...you just have to put in a little more effort to find them.\n4. No.  I like IC a lot more than I thought I would.  It is only 1 (okay...sometimes 2) extra year and it allows a huge diversification of practice.  Doing procedures is fun, mixes up the day, gives me a way to interact with a different community (surgeons, cath lab staff, other ICs, etc.) and allows me to do things that make me fulfilled (treating a STEMI is something that you feel good about). However, I definitely CAN see myself giving up IC long before retirement age.\n\nWhen it comes to the IC job market, there is a paradox that you have to understand:  There is a tradeoff between call burden and case volume.  For many, the ideal \"interventional career\" is being able to show up at work at 7, do a few hours of interesting and meaningful interventional cases, and then go home without call most days.  However, the main need for interventional cardiologists is to be available (on 24 hour call) for STEMIs.  If you want to do cases all day, you will probably end up being on call all the time so you don't have to share case volume with others.  If you want a lower call burden, you have to share case volume with more ICs.\n\nI had similar reservations to you.  At the end of the day, I thought that one more year for IC was not much risk.  I still agree with that.  Even had I not worked in IC, I still would have been glad that I did that year.  It was (oh so very) tiring, but it was super fulfilling and was the most fun year of all my training. My practice now is balanced: I take STEMI call Q5 and do a moderate number of cases otherwise.  I do a lot of general cardiology.  This has allowed me to live where I want to with acceptable income and work life balance. I don't \"live in the cath lab\" but I do enough cases to scratch the itch and I still get to go home at 5 most days.",

I veered toward imaging and HF early and I don’t envy my IC colleagues one bit.

I’m an interventional cardiologist, and I’ve worked in a rural hospital with no surgical back up as well as a major metropolitan hospital. Both can be very busy at times, but I have been able to go home most times at 5 PM from both places. I have found that pay for an interventionist has been higher than non-interventionalists, but based on other comments in this thread, it sounds like that can vary substantially.\n\nPersonally, I can’t imagine not doing intervention. I am 48 years old now, so coming in at 2 AM for an emergency is not exactly the most fun and it takes a couple of days for me to fully recover now. But I would say late night emergencies is not common. \n\nI don’t mean to offend anyone, but I don’t think in interventional cardiologists should treat interventional cardiology like a hobby. This field is only getting more complex and it requires a lot of CME on new techniques and a willingness to continue to learn how to do these new techniques. I learned how to do CTO PCI, ECMO, Bipella, etc. all after my official fellowship training and this has helped me immensely in my everyday interventional practice, even when these high-level things aren’t required.\n\nIf you are in an emotional place where you’re not sure you want to do interventional cardiology, I would not recommend that you do it. Again, this is my own personal feeling, and I don’t mean to seem condescending to others that want to be a part-time interventionist.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I’m soon to graduate EP fellowship and am in the process of interviewing for jobs. These are my top two at the moment, and I was hoping some seasoned EPs could share a little of their guidance.\n\nJob 1: Upstate NY (HCOL, high taxes)\nFormerly a private group, now purchased by a large healthcare system. 5 current EPs (three 20ish years out, one 10 years out, one 5 years out), looking to add a 6th. 4 total EP labs, one of which is for devices only. Average of 2.5 days/week lab, 2.5 days/week clinic. Typical lab day is 2-3 outpatient cases +/- 1 add-on inpatient device. FaraPulse for all AFs. Strong APP support. Clinic is 20-40 patients per day, depending on if you see work solo vs with 1-2 APPs (MD usually sees new consults, APPs see follow-ups and stable devices). Outreach clinic 2 times per month with limited support (ie you do your own device checks). See inpatient consults between cases on lab days, read Holters/Zios/ILRs/remotes between clinic patients. $650,000 guaranteed for the first 2 years, then $60/RVU. Current EPs doing 12,000-15,000 RVUs/year. Heavy on MDT and BSX for devices, seldom use Abbott. Also Carto heavy, have Rhythmia for FaraPulse, but no EnSite. 4 weeks PTO (this is my biggest reservation). Rotating General Cardiology fellows help with consults, and if interested scrub in the lab with you on their elective blocks. Call would be 1:6. EP covers TVPs overnight, on average they told me expect to have to go in 2-3 times/year overnight. Good public schools. They are looking for someone with a particular interest in extraction and VT. Good relationship with CT surgery. LAAO is shared with IC 50/50, Watchman only, no Amulet.\n\nJob 2: Suburban/Rural Midwest (LCOL, low taxes)\nAlso formerly a private group, now employed. 4 current EPs, looking to add a 5th. Much younger group: one senior guy who has been there 25 years, one who is 3 years out of fellowship, and two who are completing their first year out of fellowship. Really good vibes at dinner as all are friendly, and the young attendings are in a similar stage of life as I am (young kids, first time homeowners, etc). 4 EP labs across 2 hospitals. Similar 2.5 days/week clinic (25-30 patients per day) and 2 days/week lab. Their lab is much more efficient, 4 cases per day at minimum. Have Carto, Ensite and Rhythmia. All FaraPulse for AFs. Watchman and Amulet, though these are done in the cath lab and shared with IC, so unable to do concomitant PVI + LAAO. Excellent relationship with CT Surgery. Less robust APP support. No fellows. Half a day a week is blocked off for consults (clinic patients in the AM, hospital consults in the PM). Call would be 1:5. TVPs are covered by IC and cath lab, so really never have to go in at night. Have to round at both hospitals on the weekends. $775,000 guaranteed for 1 year, then $62/RVU. Current partners are doing between 16,000-20,000 RVUs per year (!!) and the 3 young attendings all hit the productivity threshold 10ish months into their first year. 8 weeks PTO. Have a good relationship with Abbott, MDT and BSX. Recently started using AVEIR, are in negotiations with Medtronic for Affera/Sphere-9. Looking for someone with an interest in extraction, PVCs and leadless PPMs. Most MDs in the system send their kids to private school.\n\nI should note that these are both initial offers, with Job 1 kind of reluctant to negotiate (have to go through HR for a large system) and Job 2 open to negotiating.",

What I am curious about is how can I improve my application so that when the time comes I apply to fellowship I will be as competitive as some of my MD applicants. \n\nThings I plan to do:\n\nI will take **both** COMLEX and USMLE. \n\nMy school **requires** that we do research + I will do my best to get involved in cardiology research during school. \n\nI read that applying to a IM residency that has an in house cardiology fellowship is a good idea and I plan to do just that. \n\nThere are a good amount of cardiology programs in my area/affiliated with my school. I was thinking about cold emailing some of the faculty/APDs/PDs and explaining to them my situation and saying that I would be interested in getting involved in research/volunteering/etc... with them. Does this sound silly/unprofessional? I feel like it would be a good way to make connections/get experience but is it weird to just email a cardiologist and ask them for that? \n\nI would really appreciate any advice/anything I missed. \n\nIf you got this far in this long ass post thank you so much!!\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello to the /Cardiology community, first post here, I'm a critical care paramedic, I got somehow dragged in and involved on a case during one of my travels, not registered in the coutry where this occurred. I have had mixed opinions from physicians I spoke with (various specialties) and I feel like this community might give a different insight on this case:\n\nPatient: 77M, asymptomatic, routine ECG for sports clearance.  \nCurrent ECG flagged by sport phyiscian as \"AF\". GP minimize and ignore my concerns for current therapy as troubling, refers to cardiology and taks to patient about ablation (lol).\n\nBMI 30, No history of syncope, CP, SOB, fatifue or known arrhythmia. Well hydrated, moderate/occasional alcohol consumption, no notable consumption of caffeine. Previous ECG 12 months ago: NSR.\n\nPMHx: HTN, mild T2DM (patient unaware, no dietary adjustment or specialist follow-up), No documented hx of heart failure, tachyarrythmias nor AF.\n\nLast bloods 16 months ago: slightly reduced eGFR, lipids overly suppressed, borderline HbA1c.\n\nCurrent meds prescribed by old GP, retired couple of month ago after 40+ years of career and unchanged for last 2+ years, never reviewed by new GP:  \nAtenolol 100mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, ASA 100mg, Alfuzosin 2.5mg, Olmesartan/HCTZ 40/12.5mg, Metformin 850mg\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rdvxwzio90f1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1945af1253db1f0ffad29d71c9b5470a2b1cdb5e\n\nMy interpretation:\n\n* ECG shows regular atrial activity at \\~240 bpm, clear in V1/V2.\n* Ventricular response \\~80 bpm with variable AV conduction.\n* Possibly focal atrial tachycardia with AV node protective filtering, even tho the atrial rate is more suggestive of Atrial Flutter, however without the typical saw-tooth pattern\n* Don't feel like ruling out 2nd-degree AV block Mobitz II, simply from a risk stratification perspective\n* Old GP went on a old school \"prevention-dosing spree\"\n\nMy raccomendations to the current GP (which seemed not interested in owning the patient but just to offload responsability to the cardiology referral):\n\n* Discontinue ASA and alfuzosin\n* Taper atenolol (50mg to zero), consider short-acting B-blockers if needed\n* Cut statin to 40mg or lower, reassess lipids\n* Request bloods (electrolytes, CK, HbA1c, lipids, LFTs, renal panel),\n* Repeat ECG in 2 weeks, 24h Holter if still altered\n* Refer to cardiologist + diabetic clinic\n\nRed Flags / Doubts / discussions :\n\n1. Is this truly AF? I'm incline to refuse the AF generalization due to regular atrial activity which argues against it.\n2. Could this be focal AT with AV filtering instead? The Flutter/atrial re-entry option stands? At what point misinterpretation get rectified?\n3. Could beta-blocker overdose (atenolol 100mg) + alfuzosin be masking or contributing to AV node dysfunction?\n4. Any justification for 80mg atorvastatin in a low-risk, asymptomatic primary prevention case? Any relevance to possible statin-induced myopathy, apart from possible reduced renal function or potential ↓K ↓Mg? I guess there would be other symptoms?\n5. Again, justification for HCTZ without evidence/history of HF/severe hypertension? and possible contribution to electrolyte disturbances?\n6. What would your diagnostic next steps apart from a 24h holter be, before labeling this as pathological AV block or other, It seems to me vasovagal manouvers or atropine tests would be a bit cowboy-ish and probably an overreaction?\n\nWould appreciate any input and discussion/critique considering my experience is limited to prehospital, ICU and some primary care, but some of the nuance and elegance is lost on me.",

He needs an echocardiogram though.  There is no vital sign here other than the heart rate (or I’m missing it, despite reading this a couple of times), so no reason to change his antihypertensive drug either. I agree with doing labs of course. Oh, and there’s no AV dysfunction here, this is atrial flutter with variable block, the lower rate is likely due to the atenolol.",

My intention wasn’t to be disparaging toward the GP, but to express concern about what felt like a lack of explanation or engagement with the patient, especially given the new finding and long-standing medication history. I may have been a bit direct.\n\nThis is taking place in a rural part of Italy, where it's not uncommon to see older patients on legacy prescriptions, often started empirically a decade ago or as \"prophylaxis,\" and never re-evaluated as guidelines evolved or as patient risk profiles changed, as the patient is mostly well and doesn't require GP attention (happy to expand on this if you'd like).\n\nThat’s where my questions about the atorvastatin 80 mg, atenolol 100 mg, and metformin 850 mg came from. not contesting their utility, but doubting whether they are the best tools for the job in this particular case and whether their use is evidence-based. With a slightly impaired eGFR (hence the thought of a beta-blocker with hepatic excretion and the doubt on metformin dose/utility), pre-diabetic HbA1c levels (with potential statin-induced insulin resistance and possible no-need for metformin), low LDL (questioning whether the high dose of statins is warranted), and triple antihypertensive therapy, all while on maximum-dose atenolol, which is renally cleared.\n\nSure, it might not be the priority, and I agree with you and appreciate the many other users who commented that AF/flutter is the priority here, and that anticoagulation, echo, and potentially TSH, polysomnography, or OSA investigations should be next steps. I’m absorbing all the valuable comments and learning from them.\n\nThe “lol” on ablation wasn’t mocking the option itself, but my surprise at how quickly it was mentioned in what is the first presentation in a stable and unworked-up patient — one who hasn’t been given clarity on his current medication regime (why he’s on such a high dose of statins, on long-term antiplatelets without a PPI, and on a high-dose beta-blocker), and who is unaware of any diagnosis to justify the previously applied therapy.\n\nI posted mainly to learn, and I appreciate the replies that have helped me reframe my thinking. I don’t claim to have the answers here, only questions.",

    "selftext": "Greetings, cardiology friends :)\n\nIt's that time again - time for another cardiology paper review. This time I have done a deep dive into the SPRINT (**Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention**) Trial  \n  \nThe SPRINT trial, initially published in \\*NEJM\\* in 2015, investigated whether intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) control (&lt;120 mm Hg) reduced cardiovascular events compared to a standard target (&lt;140 mm Hg) in high-risk, non-diabetic patients.\n\nIt became one of the most influential blood pressure trials in decades, shaping US and other jurisdictions' guidelines - but also raising methodological debates around early stopping, composite outcome interpretation, and real-world implementation.\n\nIn this review, I unpack the trial design, statistical validity, generalisability, and implications for cardiologists and researchers.\n\n# I. Introduction &amp; Background\n\nThe **Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)**, published by Wright et al. (2015), was a landmark, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT) that tested a simple but important question: would targeting a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 120 mm Hg - rather than the standard 140 mm Hg - reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk, non-diabetic individuals?\n\nSPRINT was conceived in a landscape of uncertainty. Previous trials had shown inconsistent results. The ACCORD-BP trial (2010) tested similar intensive blood pressure targets in people with diabetes but failed to demonstrate a clear mortality benefit. HYVET (2008) showed benefits of treating hypertension in people aged over 80 but did not address lower BP targets. Meanwhile, clinical guidelines varied widely. At the time SPRINT began, American and European recommendations diverged, especially in older populations and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nSPRINT was not only statistically well designed but also strategically scoped to address gaps left by previous studies. Its impact has been substantial—reshaping US guidelines and contributing to global debate on the optimal level of BP control. In this review, we assess the trial’s statistical and methodological rigour, highlight key findings, and explore implications for clinical practice and policy.\n\n# II. Trial Design and Methodology\n\nSPRINT was a multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group RCT with blinded outcome adjudication. Conducted across 102 clinical sites in the United States and Puerto Rico, the study enrolled 9,361 adults aged 50 years or older with SBP between 130 and 180 mm Hg and increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes or prior stroke (Ambrosius et al., 2014).\n\n👉 \\[Read the full review here\\](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews/sprint/)",

This actually gets to the heart of SPRINT’s external validity limitations (see the [updated online review](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews/sprint/the) for further details). The trial enrolled stable outpatients, and BP measurement was protocolised and automated. In inpatient settings, BP readings are often elevated due to non-pathological factors like pain, anxiety, or acute illness.\n\nApplying intensive SBP targets like &lt;120 mmHg in that context risks over-treatment. From what I understand from clinical colleagues, many inpatient hypertensives are transiently elevated, and aggressively lowering BP could increase harm (e.g., falls, hypoperfusion).\n\nThe SPRINT population was carefully selected — exclusion criteria eliminated frailty, diabetes, prior stroke, and significant comorbidity.\n\nSo no — we should not extrapolate these results to unselected hospital inpatients, at least not without serious consideration of the underlying cause of elevated BP, the clinical context, and the patient’s overall risk profile.",

They would always take their resting BP after relaxing for at least 10 minutes and report readings around 135/85 most of the time, but the second they got up and walked a few steps or were a bit stressed, their readings jumped to what you'd expect after going up a flight of stairs or two. But there were no other signs of those few steps being any challenge for them or exhausting them, and subjectively they reported that walking is effortless for them, basically no matter the distance.\n\nThey'd be recommended lifestyle modifications based on the readings at rest, but at the same time these findings would suggest that they are hypertensive for any awake second they aren't preparing to take their readings at rest.\n\nSo I'm wondering if they should be managed differently than their readings at rest would usually suggest.  \nAt the same time I've been thinking about what you're saying - treating them aggressively may cause their resting BP to drop too low.\n\nI don't know their BP at sleep (no 24h monitor done), but they've reported readings of 105-110/60-70 immediately after waking up and measuring while still lying in bed.\n\nASCVD I don't think would be accurate since this patient is below 30, but using their resting BP and assuming age 40, their ASCVD would read a 10 year risk of \\~1.9%.\n\nNo other health issues known, BMI 26 (so they were obviously recommended losing weight as well)\n\nDon't know how they were actually managed in the end, and don't have access to finding out.",

(performance bias). \n* The loss of patients from the 'intensive' group may have represented patients that could not (or chose not to) tolerate the lower BPs. (attrition bias)\n* During longer-term follow up, the fact that the systolic blood pressures equalized in both groups could represent that many of the 'intensive' patients could not tolerate lower blood pressures.  This could be due to comorbid conditions.  It is very possible that these comorbid conditions themselves affect mortality. (collider bias) \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think SPRINT is a great study that does affect practice.  It's just curious that the groups equalize as time goes on.  Aside from my bullet points above, it is also very possible that the groups equalized because they stopped being treated according to study protocols and just went back to (now outdated) \"standard of care\".  I find this a little challenging to believe, but it is possible.\n\n  \nSPRINT convinces me that we should try to get hypertensive patients to less than 120 mmHg systolic \\**when it is reasonable to do so\\**.  That is how I practice.  \n\nThings I take into account for my decision include: patient age, number of meds they are on, medications available (have not failed, not contraindicated), presence of other unrelated serous medical conditions, presence of related medical conditions (aneurysms, chronic dissections, valve disease, etc.), ASCVD risk, patient motivation/buy in and patient plans for the near future (lifestyle interventions).\n\nIf a hypertensive patient is at 130 mmHg and is 88 years old without other problems, I am generally not going to start another med for them.  If a 55 year old obese patient with hypertension is currently at 125 mmHg and just started a GLP-1 agent, they are also not getting a new medication.",

Others would focus on differences in lifestyle between two different specialties. \n\nAs often happens in life, these decisions are also affected by external factors. I too was thinking about either cardiology or cardiovascular surgery in medical school. However, the cardio thoracic surgeons at my medical school were jerks, and whenever I arrived for or left my surgical rotation, their (admittedly amazing) cars were there in the parking lot. So I chose medicine.\n\nIn my residency program, the cardiothoracic surgeons were cerebral and amazing. Had I done medical school where I did residency, my initial choice may have been different. \n\nAs it turned out, the cardiologists were also charismatic, especially the heart failure cardiologists, and so I went down that path. And as  I came to hospital before any medical student and left well after they departed during my attending years, I chuckled to myself as to how it all devolved. I worked very closely with the CT surgeons as medical director of the LVAD program, and they often commented on how my mindset was ‘surgical,’ while I was always impressed by their insistence on reviewing echocardiograms primarily and managing physiology in the cardiothoracic ICU. \n\nSo in the end we really weren’t all that different, save for the lack of OR time for me ( though I would be called in to OR to offer my opinion on cases eg VAD positioning, and spent a lot of time in cath lab - my ‘OR’). Physiology was my first love, and hemodynamics continue to captivate me. For me, RHC &gt;&gt;&gt; LHC (unless there’s a STEMi). \n\nYou may know that there is increasing hybridization of CT surgery and interventional cardiology training (eg TAVR, CT surgeons acquiring wire skills for catheter based interventions). Also consider that in terms of lifestyle, I’m not sure that the hours of CT surgeons and interventional cardiologists, at least, are that much different.\n\nSpend some time in the OR, spend some time in the cath lab/CCU, but, most importantly, spend time with physicians who love what they do. That’s where you’ll get both inspiration and the best idea of what a fulfilling career in either field looks like.",

And, if so, will it work over clothing such as a long-sleeved t-shirt or light sweater? Secondly, I saw a video of a provider using it without the ear pieces and simply a paired iPod earpiece. Is this practical? I would mind having less bulk in my pocket.\n\nThank you for any feedback. The cost of the Eko 500 has me curious about the use of basic stethoscope uses.",

Good command of nephro/gastro/lung dsx is so important for your heart failure patients.\n\nTo get to your question,\n\nfor general cardiology knowledge base - I'd get access to ACCSAP and Mayo ASAP. The cardiology literature is vast and updating quickly. Textbooks in today's cardiology, although good for forming a strong base, are just too much. Hence, condense ACCSAP and Mayo review courses have everything you need for now and 1-2 years within your cardiology fellowship. If you're an ANKI fan, there's a deck based on ACCSAP and Mayo (send an email to [salemsanki@gmail.com](mailto:salemsanki@gmail.com) \"[ACCSAP DECK](https://ankicardio.substack.com/p/comprehensive-anki-deck-based-on?r=3ksag3&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true)\")\n\n* for ECG you will probably need an extra source; O'Keefe ECG online course is what people usually recommend and assuming that you have your basics covered you should give it a go and solve as many cases as you can in the first few months of your fellowship.\n* echocardiography and cath lab; university of Toronto has a website that helps you better understand echo windows and having a basic understanding of what we're looking at from each window should be enough until you start your fellowship. Same goes for the Cath lab; Elias Hanna has a great youtube channel that takes you through the basics (again, you can dm me if you have trouble finding these).\n\nI believe these should take care of your cardiology needs for your time in residency. There's amazing resources waiting for you once you get to the fellowship. Good luck!",

Confirmed syncope by family). They re-awoke, family activated 911. \n\nPertinent history:\nMI w/ two stents. HTN, hyperlipemia, decreased ejection fraction, and obviously an AICD. They state that their AICD has never fired since it was placed(approximately 2 years prior). \nMedications:\nXarelto, lasix, several antiarrhythmics\n\nAssessment: \nStates they were experiencing slight dizziness, mild shortness of breath, and mild nausea. 12 lead ekg obtained showing atrial tachycardia and a possible ideoventricular block, no obvious ST changes or further noted ectopy. BP was normal, EtCo2 was 40. Breathing 20 full and effective with clear lung sounds in all fields. O2 sat was 92% on room air. Physical exam was unremarkable other than slight pale/cool/clammy skins. \n\nTreatment: \nI placed the pt on o2, established an IV in their L AC. I planned on administering 150mg of Amio in 100ml of D5W over 15”. However, they state they has an allergy to amioderone, was prescribed it but was then taken off the medication. Therefore, the only other medication that I had at my disposal was Lidocane. However, I was not confident in what the does should have been or how I would have administered it. I was thinking possibly a 0.5mg/KG bolus over 2 min. But then I thought of a drip too, but I honestly had no idea what would have been more appropriate. Upon arrival to the closest cardiac facility, I gave a turnover to the attending. I then asked what he would have done given the situation. He stated that he too would have considered lido. I asked him what he thought as far as dosing and he stated ”honestly dude, I’m going to consult cardiology and see what they say”. I waited for the cardiologist to make their way down, but it was taking quite some time and I needed to get back in service. \n\nSo any insight would help, just curious as to what some of your thought processes would be and what would you do. Thanks in advance! \n\n",

It does not provide any atrial arrhythmia suppression.\n\nBefore Amiodarone became popular, lido was carried everywhere in EMS. The dosage is 1-4mg/min on the drip and 1mg/kg for bolus. One prefill box contains 100mg. I understand the AHA ACLS still recommends lidocaine as the first-line antiarrhythmic in amino contraindications (vf/vt only).\n\nGiven the numerous (7) AICD shocks it would be reasonable to start a prehospital lido infusion for suspected recurrent VT until interrogation can occur.",

I'm confused what the patient's ECG showed because a patient cannot simultaneously have both atrial tachycardia and IVR. \n\nGenerally, neither are treated with antiarrhythmics, especially prehospital. Unless I'm missing something, I would caution the use of any antiarrhythmic on either of those presentations. Perhaps the patient was going into a lethal rhythm like VT and the AICD was doing it's job (sounds likely. AICDs don't cause unconsciousness, but VT does...) if you witness a lethal arrhythmia, treat it. But until then it's reasonable and prudent to wait for AICD interrogation to find out what's going on. Why was the AICD placed? This often answers the question about what happened when it fired. \n\nAs far as the dose of lidocaine, 0.5mg/kg IVP to start, but this is something you should be referencing protocols for. If it's not in protocol, contact OLMC.\n\nTL;DR: Sounds like the patient was going into a lethal arrhythmia and the AICD did it's job. Monitor, transport and reassess. If a lethal arrhythmia presents, treat it.",

    "selftext": "Greetings all. \n\nAs promised yesterday, here is my review of the CAPRICORN Trial. I wnet down a bit of a rabbit hole on this one, and I found it very interesting indeed ! Comments/questions are welcome !\n\nI hope some people find it useful. \n\nIf anyone wants to propose another paper for review, please do so, and if possible use [this thread to do so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiology/comments/1k263d5/statistical_and_methodological_reviews_of/). Otherwise I will choose something new on a topic that interests me (currently that is cardiotoxicity in patients receiving cancer therapies).\n\nThese reviews will also be available [on my website](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews.html), along with a \"Statistics Glossary for Cardiologists\", which I hope will also be useful. Any suggestions or comments are very welcome.\n\n-------------\n\n# Review and Statistical Critique of the CAPRICORN Trial (Lancet, 2001)\n\n# Background and Rationale\n\nThe CAPRICORN trial evaluated the efficacy of carvedilol, a third-generation β-blocker, in patients who had experienced a myocardial infarction and exhibited significant left ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤40%). Previous β-blocker trials often excluded high-risk populations, leading to uncertainty about their applicability to contemporary clinical practice (Dargie &amp; CAPRICORN Steering Committee, 2000).\n\n# Original Study Design and Statistical Plan\n\nCAPRICORN was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,959 patients between 1997 and 1999. The initial primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with the study powered at 80% to detect significant differences at an α-level of 0.05 (Dargie &amp; CAPRICORN Steering Committee, 2000). A pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled after 125 deaths to assess early efficacy or futility — a common practice in clinical trials to determine whether a study should continue as planned, be modified, or be stopped early for ethical or scientific reasons.\n\n# Statistical Plan Amendment and Controversy\n\nMidway through the trial, the interim analysis revealed a lower-than-expected mortality rate, raising concerns about the study’s statistical power. Consequently, the primary endpoint was revised to include co-primary endpoints: all-cause mortality (α = 0.005) and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission (α = 0.045). This adjustment effectively split the original α-level between the two endpoints. Owen (2001) criticised this change, suggesting it introduced interpretive bias and compromised the trial’s validity, especially since the mortality result was emphasised despite not meeting the stricter significance threshold.\n\n# Authors’ Rebuttal and Remaining Concerns\n\nThe original authors responded to Owen (2001) in the same editorial, emphasising the amendment's ethical and practical motivations. They argued that the change was made before unblinding, approved by the ethics committee, and aimed to maintain clinical relevance given the unexpectedly low mortality rate. They also stated that the α-split was transparently incorporated into the revised protocol.\n\nWhile these arguments have merit, concerns remain. The lack of formal α-spending approaches, such as O’Brien-Fleming boundaries, raises questions about statistical rigour. Furthermore, emphasising the mortality result — despite it not meeting the revised threshold — suggests a disconnect between formal statistical claims and narrative presentation. The rebuttal, though sincere, does not fully alleviate concerns about post-hoc adaptation and selective emphasis.\n\n# Understanding Mid-Trial Alpha-Level Changes\n\nIn clinical trials, the pre-specified α-level should represent the maximum tolerable Type I error — the probability of incorrectly concluding treatment efficacy. Altering the α-level after interim data analysis is problematic, as it can inflate the risk of false-positive conclusions and undermine the integrity of the hypothesis test.\n\nAdaptive changes in trials facing operational challenges, like lower-than-expected event rates, can be acceptable if proper safeguards are employed. These include group sequential designs or α-spending functions, which mathematically preserve the overall Type I error rate. CAPRICORN did not utilise these methods. Although the revised thresholds were agreed upon before unblinding, the revision appears influenced by interim trends, introducing ambiguity about the independence of the statistical plan from emerging results.\n\nSuch changes are uncommon in well-powered cardiovascular outcome trials and even rarer without formal statistical correction. CAPRICORN exemplifies how statistical flexibility can blur the line between clinical relevance and methodological rigour.\n\n# Ethical Dimensions of Protocol Amendments\n\nThe CAPRICORN authors cited ethical reasons for the amendment, arguing that continuing to collect mortality data alone, when unlikely to yield definitive answers, would be inappropriate. They claimed the change preserved patient value and avoided unnecessary risk or prolongation.\n\nHowever, this ethical defence warrants scrutiny. If equipoise had been lost, continuing placebo administration might have been unethical; if equipoise remained, the trial’s planned endpoints should have persisted. This reveals an inconsistency. Moreover, it is unclear whether participants were informed of the amendment or if subsequent consent materials reflected the updated objectives. Transparency to participants is an ethical imperative.\n\nBeyond individual patient protection, trials have an ethical duty to the scientific community: to produce trustworthy, reproducible knowledge. By changing endpoints mid-trial and later highlighting a nominally significant result, CAPRICORN potentially undermined that trust — despite intentions. Ethical conduct encompasses beneficence, respect for persons, and scientific integrity.\n\n# Main Results and Statistical Interpretation\n\nFor the composite endpoint, results showed no significant benefit (HR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80–1.07; p = 0.296). Mortality alone reached nominal significance (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60–0.98; p = 0.03), failing to meet the revised pre-specified threshold (α = 0.005). Secondary results included reductions in cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.75; p = 0.024) and non-fatal MI (HR = 0.59; p = 0.014) — both of which were statistically unadjusted and exploratory, warranting cautious interpretation.\n\n# Mechanistic Support from Substudies\n\nDespite methodological criticisms, strong biological substantiation emerged from two substudies. The Echo substudy demonstrated clear beneficial effects on LV remodelling, significantly reducing LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (Pfeffer et al., 2004). Furthermore, McMurray et al.’s (2005) arrhythmia substudy reported marked reductions in malignant ventricular arrhythmias (HR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.11–0.49; p &lt; 0.0001), strengthening the clinical justification for carvedilol use post-MI.\n\n# Contextualisation Within the Literature\n\nCAPRICORN’s outcomes align with earlier meta-analyses of β-blockers post-MI (eg., Freemantle et al., 1999), which demonstrated mortality benefit in broader populations. Importantly, CAPRICORN extended this evidence to higher-risk individuals with LV dysfunction. The American Heart Association’s 2001 guidelines referenced CAPRICORN as supporting evidence for carvedilol’s inclusion in post-MI regimens. Historical β-blocker trials such as BHAT and the Norwegian Timolol Study showed mortality reductions in less complex populations, and CAPRICORN importantly demonstrated additive benefit when combined with contemporary therapies such as ACE inhibitors.\n\n# Methodological Critique and Clinical Implications\n\nThe statistical and ethical limitations associated with CAPRICORN’s mid-trial amendments are non-trivial. Clinicians must interpret the reported mortality benefit with appropriate caution. That said, the overall therapeutic narrative for carvedilol is supported by consistent mechanistic data and wider trial evidence. CAPRICORN thus contributes meaningfully to practice — albeit with caveats regarding methodological integrity.\n\n# Conclusions and Clinical Recommendations\n\nCarvedilol remains a rational choice for post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, underpinned by mechanistic plausibility and external evidence. However, CAPRICORN is a textbook example of why strict adherence to pre-specified statistical analysis plans is critical. Clinical researchers must balance ethics, practicality, and methodological discipline to safeguard credibility.\n\n# Glossary (Selected Terms)\n\n**Alpha-level**  \nThe pre-specified threshold for statistical significance.

Surrogate end point relationship with desired outcomes are sometimes surprising (CAST trial is a striking exemple)\n\nAs for the use of BB in clinical practice today :\n\n- no good evidence for routine use for lvef &gt;50 (reduce-ami)\n- older studies before reperfusion era are not applicable\n- useful for heart failure with low lvef\n- no strong evidence for their routine use post MI when lvef is low, unless other indications are present.  i use them in this setting anyway but very cautiously and wait until I feel the patient is not at risk. Clinical judgement is king.",

The reason why this is statistically invalid (without proper correction) is that we just went from throwing 1 dice to throwing 2 dices (albeit, a 6 sided and like 20 sided), which increases the probability they get a \"hit\" or positive result. I guess to take it to an extreme, if they split it into 10 different new primary outcomes at 0.005, they're now throwing 10 different dice.\n\nIs this a correct understanding of why it is erroneous to do this?",

We use a risk scoring system, typically the CHADS-VASC, to determine someone’s risk of stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Depending on the risk, we then may recommend oral anticoagulation. Would this be something you would be willing to do? If you don’t wanna take blood thinners, there may not be any rationale, looking for atrial fibrillation\n2. The value of oral anticoagulation in asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with relatively short duration is questionable. This is based on pacemaker detected atrial fibrillation studies. \n3. Be prepared for a lot of false positives. The Apple Watch and other similar devices use an algorithm that seem to be good at differentiating normal from not normal rhythm, but is poor at differentiating the different types of arrhythmias falling in the not normal category.",

Your cards PD doesn’t want someone who’s “smart” at cards - they will teach you that. They want the best internal med doc in their class \n\n- get to know the PD and have face time with them either through rotations, cards lectures, cards grand rounds, educational symposiums\n\n- goes without saying but make sure the fellows like you \n\n- have a good reputation and also do not brush off non-cards electives bc most PDs will even ask other specialty attendings (endo, rheum, ID) what they thought of you and how your behavior was \n\n- be easy going and flexible to work with. You do not want to be known as the resident who rocks the boat \n\nBest of luck!!",

    "selftext": "Hello\n\nBackground: I am 26 y.o. currently working as a cardiac technologist, mainly in CVL. There's opportunity to learn echo in the future, but probably in a year or two. The hospital is also giving out sponsorships to take on Masters programme which i can apply for next year. However, recently, I was given the opportunity to join a paediatric hospital, mainly focusing on Echo. Interview is next Tuesday. I have only joined my current job in CVL for about 5 months and is not Echo trained\n\nWhile I feel that there's a lot to learn for Cath, which is rewarding; and enjoy the adrenaline rush, I really feel drained after every day's work and all I do is have dinner and sleep after work. I work over the weekends too. So i have no life of my own. And this would be worse after I start on calls.\n\nThe children hospital does require us to do Cath once a week, and other non invasive procedures including Echo. But it's probably not as in-depth (we probs won't be needing to learn EP, implants or to use the machines like IVUS/OCT/FFR/etc. unlike in my current job). They also offer pathways like Management/Education/Research as i develop and advance in my career whereas my current job's only pathway is a senior clinical role.  \n\nMy boyfriend adviced for me to stay till i get sponsored for the masters programme, master CVL while serving the bond, then find another hospital to learn echo and progress myself with my higher qualification and experience in CVL.\n\nI am in contemplation if I should resign and go over to the paediatric hospital and would like to get some advice from this.\n\nHere's some of the considerations i'm thinking of:\n\n1) Which earns better in the long run while providing a better work-life balance?\n\n2) Which skillset is more valued by the industry in the future when AI takes over?\n\n3) Which skillset would be able to open more doors for me in the future (e.g. if i were to be tired of clinical work and rather do (e.g) research/education/medical sales/management)?\n\n4) is the masters degree really worth to stay for if i'm not into management?\n\n5) any other inputs?\n\nthanks guys!!",

You can train anywhere, but your odds of matching to a cardiology are significantly better if you are coming from a respected academic (or equivalent) program.  It’s the difference between “probably going to match” and “probably not going to match”.  Try to do well in med school to make this an option.  NOTE: for those of you who are not at these top IM programs, I mean no disrespect.  You can still match to cardiology.  However, as you have likely discovered, you have to excel and put in extra effort (which is very respectable).\n\nOther things to do in med school:\n- Try to get a little exposure to cardiology and other fields that interprets you.\n- Learn how to read correctly read ECGs.  There is no reason to wait until residency to do this.",

Getting into a rigorous IM program that will expose you to a lot of pathologies will give you an edge \n\n- do well on step exam. This is becoming less and less important but depending on where you want to go might have more of an influence \n\n- be realistic. Cards is super competitive.

Also, owning or having access to a CT scanner can be very lucrative, especially with the new bump in cCTA reimbursement.

Both are still solid programs. THI is attending and midlevel run and can be very cush outside of interventional training, and Baylor is heavily resident run and very cush for fellows.\n\nI wouldn’t consider THI a powerhouse for anything other than interventional.

I interviewed there myself. I'm not sure how they've supposedly gone downhill or what that even means. Or why you think things have changed over the years. Things really don't change all that much. By and large it seems the same from what I hear.  It was and still seems clinically strong. The fellows get to see and do a lot and have a ton of autonomy. It's always been the IC powerhouse though with solid EP and HF. No one really seems to care about CT/MRI there. Most attendings are private/employed and not all that academic. It was the only interview where they said private practice isn't a bad word, lol. But really the attraction of the program is major hospital volume and breadth w/o any of the academic stuff in a solid city. Moreover, at least when I interviewed it sounded pretty nice and really stuck with me as a non-academic type. 2nd/3rd year were easy, additional stipend, moonlighting, guaranteed advanced fellowship spots. But really a lot of this stuff doesn't really matter in the real world and most programs will train you perfectly well. I wouldn't worry too much about level 2 either.\n\nAlso, I'm aware of the problems the Tx program had. My coresident was a fellow there around that time and I was interested in HF so we talked a lot.

It wasn't their first choice to come to our program, they may be unhappy with the position, or they may get \"stuck\" not matching either for several cycles or permanently.\n\nCards Hospitalist jobs are becoming much more common and fellowships don't give preferential consideration for such hospitalists vs general medicine hospitalists. Applicants need to have a great deal of motivation to bolster their applications with research, letters of recommendations, and all the other usual factors all while performing the functions of their job.\n\nIMO the comments so far are partly accurate re: \"you are in demand as a hospitalist.\" If you are ok with a general medicine hospitalist job or a cards hospitalist nocturnist position, you will have no problem finding a job if you apply post-match. Quality daytime cards hospitalist jobs are less common and can be more selective.\n\nFellowship application has become incredibly competitive year over year and am often surprised by who doesn't match.

I'll emphasize this again: you need to network - reach out to connections (current or former fellows) in programs you are interested in, see if they will put in a word about you, and learn from them what is the culture of their program. You can send a quick note to the fellowship coordinator with a brief email selling yourself/your interest in the program/why you are a good fit (based on conversations from your connections).   \n  \nFellowship programs have limited resources to interview applicants. Many programs only interview 40-50 candidates out of a pool of 1000+ applications. If they see you have done all your training/currently live in MA but are applying to a small community program in OR/WA, they won't bother considering your application (as there's very low probability you would come there, from their perspective). A personal note from you sharing that you are interested in their program, you've talked to fellows there and you believe you'll be a good fit for X/Y/Z reasons, will go a long way for you. \n\nYou can also leverage your letter writers for interviews at certain programs they may still have connections to.  \n  \nBest of luck!",

I understand CVT doesn't pay as much as echo, but I don't know if the physical rigor is worth the extra money.\n\nCan anybody give me the pros and cons of each?

There's opportunity to learn echo in the future, but probably in a year or two. The hospital is also giving out sponsorships to take on Masters programme which i can apply for next year. However, recently, I was given the opportunity to join a paediatric hospital, mainly focusing on Echo. I have only joined my current job in CVL for about 5 months and is not Echo trained\n\nWhile I feel that there's a lot to learn for Cath, which is rewarding; and enjoy the adrenaline rush, I really feel drained after every day's work and all I do is have dinner and sleep after work. I work over the weekends too. So i have no life of my own. And this would be worse after I start taking calls.\n\nMy boyfriend adviced for me to stay till i get sponsored for the masters programme, master CVL while serving the bond, then find another hospital to learn echo and progress myself with my higher qualification and experience in CVL.\n\nI am in contemplation if I should resign and go over to the paediatric hospital and would like to get some advice from this.\n\nHere's some of the considerations i'm thinking of:\n\nWhich earns better in the long run while providing a better work-life balance?\nWhich skillset is more valued by the industry in the future when AI takes over?\nWhich skillset would be able to open more doors for me in the future (e.g. if i were to be tired of clinical work and rather do (e.g) research/education/medical sales/management)?\nany other inputs?",

I'm considering staying at my home institution for EP fellowship for several personal and professional reasons. However, one downside is that the program doesn't currently offer exposure to some of the more advanced technologies—for example, it remains largely fluoroscopy-dependent.\n\nOne of my specific goals is to learn fluoroless techniques. That said, I'm curious how EPs typically learn and adopt newer technologies after completing fellowship. As the field continues to evolve rapidly, I imagine this is a critical—and potentially challenging—aspect of staying current and expanding one’s skill set outside of a structured training program.\n\nI’d really appreciate any insights or advice from those who have navigated this in their own careers.\n\nThanks in advance!",

With current fluoro systems and radiation protection, exposure to the patient is minimal and to the operator is near non-existent. Prior to PFA, it would be uncommon to use more than 2-4 minutes of low dose fluoroscopy for catheter placement, transseptal, etc. Now with PFA it’s almost always less than 1-2 minutes. Operators are using more fluoro for a pacemaker placement and are getting much more exposure with proximity to the beam and often less protective shielding.

You can take a few minutes every case to try something different and gradually build a new skill.\n\nOn topic of fluoroless, I had limited exposure to fluoroless transeptals but I have been asking for tips and trying it out every case with leads on and now the majority I don’t even press the fluoro but it’s there if I need. \n\nI agree with the previous comments though re: fluoroless being gimmicky. You can just use your 10-15s of fluoro and then take off your lead afterwards. And as you graduate transition towards flouroless, you can still keep it there as a back up. Just work towards a minimal fluoro.  floral.",

Usually people are worked hard as indentured laborers and then when the time comes for partnership comes they never materialize for one reason or other. The associates then usually have to leave the area due to non competes while the practice hires another victim to start the cycle again. Since there is usually no database of such predatory practices the new person gets sucked into the same trap like hapless mice.

        "body": "Great question and one that is at the top of mind for both practicing Interventional Cardiologists and fellows alike.  Just as a bit of background, I’ve worked for one of the main Angio manufacturers for the past 19 years and I’ve never seen more momentum about safety as I have in the past year.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, there have been significant improvements and options for safety since I started my career in both dose reduction and prevention.\n\nFor dose reduction, because of advances in detector/tube technology, software and all components of the imaging chain, all manufacturers of Angio systems have made huge leaps in reducing dose. However, much of the dose reduction depends on the physician as well because there is a strong correlation between image quality and dose. If the IC wants higher imaging quality for better soft tissue visualization and less noise, it comes at the cost of higher radiation. Conversely, some ICs are fine with a noisy image with very little dose.\n\nThe other side of the coin to radiation reduction is protection. Companies like Rampart, Protego, Egg Medical and Radiaction have created shielding systems that reduce scatter radiation to the point that some or all of the in lab staff can shed their lead. This also helps from an orthopedic view as well because wearing 30lbs of lead for years can cause a multitude of problems with your back, knees, etc.\n\nMy conclusion when talking with anyone getting into the field is the following:\n\n1. Interventional cardiology is one of the most rewarding fields in medicine. Seeing the immediate difference you make in the longevity of a patient is beyond gratifying.\n2. There is still a risk of radiation exposure but through proper protection and system use, it can be minimized.\n3. There are still technologies that are emerging like remote catheter and guidewire control systems that will continue to reduce the risk.\n\nBest of luck in your choice and I’m happy to talk with you if you have any more questions! Feel free to DM me",

I have co-authored some peer-reviewed journal articles and worked with data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), the UK Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Registry, and some cardiotoxicity-related datasets.\n\nI would like to learn more about cardiology in general and I wondered if anyone here might be able to provide some book or other resources that could be suitable/useful for me.  I have a background in Biochemistry from university a long time ago, but no medical training, and all I know about cardiology is some basics that I have gleaned from my clinical colleagues that allows me to perform statistical analyses.  \n  \nCurrently I am very interested in cardiotoxicity. Obviously I realise there is an overlap with oncology.    \n  \nThanks and best wishes  \nRL\n\n",

We have 3 AHF attendings. In August, one of them took some time off as his daughter was getting married (he was the most senior attending). The 2nd one got seriously ill and had to take medical leave from the hospital for a few months. That left the 3rd, most junior attending.\n\nShe worked every single day for 2 months straight. Had to come in every single weekend to round on the advanced HF patients because she was the only one who could. Came in for the holidays (Labor Day) to round. Finally the other attendings came back, but the moral is no general cardiologist will round or take responsibility for these patients.\n\nOn top of that you're coordinating with surgeons for VAD or transplants. Handling scripts of milrinone delivery. And any advanced HF patient, regardless of why they come in, is your patient. AHF will always be primary with other services consulting because no one feels confident in managing these patients.\n\nYour milrinone patients you sent home on a PICC line got a line associated infection? Well they're on the advanced HF team inpatient until the infection clears. Your VAD patient has a drive-line infection? Well they're on the AHF teams with Gen surg consulting. Your transplant patient has PNA? Well on the AHF team with ID and Pulm consulting.\n\nLiterally every decision other attendings, cardiologist as well will defer to you. Should a VAD patient who has a slow Hgb bleed be put back on their coumadin? And if so when? Guess who is making that decision. \n\nThe AHF pay also isn't that much higher unless you're building up a VAD or transplant program in a hospital system that doesn't have it. But you're going to work to get patients, then form and maintain a good relationship with surgeons. For VADs you then need to follow and have the services for post VAD complications, same with transplant. I know of AHF guys in the philly/philly suburbs/south jersey/north jersey area who built their own programs, but they worked and dealt with a lot of criticism and even legal inquiries regarding who they VAD'ed and who they put on the transplant list. \n\nIn order to make money in AHF you need to increase the number of patients getting VADs or transplant, but with comes a considerably higher risk at a legal and professional level.\n\nSo as a AHF doc, you'll be working considerably harder, longer, covering more shifts and you may not make more than your gen car counterparts.\n\nI respect those who go into it because of the sacrifice the field takes. You have to live for those moments in clinic where the VAD patient is celebrating his 5th VAD anniversary with his grandchild, or the 45 year old transplant patient watching their child graduate from high school. Those are impactful and beautiful.\n\nBut they all come at the cost of your life, the attending.",

When you’re looking at call, rounding, and clinic structure, it’s all about finding the right balance.\n\nFor call, you’ll want to know how often you’re expected to be on, and if there’s a good team or support system to help out when things get busy. Same with rounding—make sure you’re clear on how much inpatient work you'll be doing and if there’s a hospitalist team to help with the heavy lifting. As for the clinic, it’s key to understand how patient load works, what the patient base looks like, and what kind of support staff you’ll have.\n\nAs for red flags, just watch out for vague answers when it comes to expectations around hours, volume, and what kind of backup you’ll have. If anything feels like they’re not being clear on those things, it’s worth digging a bit deeper.\n\nThat being said, we’re actually looking for a **Non-Invasive Cardiologist** to join a Regional provider in the Greater Atlanta area! It’s a great opportunity if you’re looking for a manageable call schedule, a solid clinic setup, and a supportive team. We’re all about making sure everyone has the right balance of work and life, and we’ve got a strong infrastructure in place to help you thrive.  Worst case, it could be great interview skills.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’d love to chat more about the role and see if it might be a good fit for you. Feel free to reach out anytime!\n\nGood luck with everything—hope to hear from you!",

Isn’t it synonymous with TPR and DBP? How are cardiac contractility and SV the deciding factors here and not SVR ? \n\nSimilarly, In another question on aortic stenosis, one of the options says the same concept\n“In a patient with AS, LV afterload is determined by the mean systolic blood pressure and the degree of transvalvular obstruction. This patient's acute hypotension would actually cause a reduction in afterload.”\n\n",

        "body": "I am not 100% sure what you are asking, but I'll take a crack at it.\n\nI think part of the problem here is that the term \"afterload\" is often tossed around casually. When we are talking about \"afterload\" we are technically talking about the force opposing sarcomere contraction during systole (minus the amount of opposing force present during diastole).  However, by the Young-Laplace equation (with some assumptions) we know that the 'force opposing sarcomere' contraction is directly proportional to the pressure that the blood in the LV must push against to eject blood (this is the systolic blood pressure PLUS any pressure caused by obstructions like aortic and subaortic stenosis).  Because of this we often refer to blood pressure (plus any other pressure increase from AS, etc.) as \"afterload\". This is conceptually, if not technically, correct and is a useful way to think about things.\n\nThe blood pressure that contributes to the afterload is the blood pressure during SYSTOLE.  this means that, technically, the afterload is changing a little as the systolic blood pressure varies.  So the DBP is NOT what is creating an afterload.\n\nI think the confusion you are facing when you are considering afterload to be related to DBP is with the way the Young-Laplace equation is typically presented in hemodynamic texts.  The classic presentation uses the starting systolic blood pressure (along with the radius and thickness of a simplified, cylindrical LV) to illustrate the relationship between pressure and wall tension (force opposing sarcomeres). However, since the \"starting systolic blood pressure\" is equivalent to the \"end diastolic pressure\" (a much more common term), that pressure (EDP) is usually placed in the Young-Laplace equation of these explanations.  This is the pressure that the heart must overcome to START systole, but (as you know) the average BP in systole is much higher than the EDP and that is the true afterload.  Presentaions of the Young-Laplace equation like this is meant to illustrate that the force on sarcomeres during systole is directly proportional to the pressure faced but the LV...nothing more.  It is not correct to extrapolate that the average afterload is therefore proportional to EDP (which is only the starting pressure in systole). Does that make sense?\n\nIt is true that afterload is proportional to SVR at any given time by Ohm's law: ΔP = Q \\* R, where ΔP is essentially afterload.  However, remember that none of these three variables is in steady-state throughout the cardiac cycle and across different physiologic states; all three are constantly changing.  In exercise, R (SVR) goes down but Q (cardiac output) goes up much more, so the net effect is an increase in ΔP.  You also  know this empirically from observing treadmill stress tests, where the SBP increases significantly.\n\nThe AS concept is probably one that you are overthinking.  Think about what pressure the LV \"sees\" during systole.  It is basically the sum of all the things causing the increase in pressure. In this case, the pressure  from AS and the pressure from the VR (vascular resistance).\n\nΔP = ΔPas + ΔPvr\n\nor (applying Ohm's law), you can write this in terms of resistances...\n\nΔP = Q \\* (Ras+ Rvr).\n\nor\n\nAFTERLOAD ∝ AS\\_Resistance + SVR\n\nAssuming constant cardiac output, hypotension means low SVR, which means the afterload will decrease.",

As afterload depends on SVR and not DBP. \n\nAnd as for aortic stenosis, I actually thought that hypotension means low SBP due to low CO caused by aortic stenosis rather than low SVR because the answer seems to phrase it that way. There isn’t any mention of low SVR nor constant CO. And it kind of doesn’t make sense to me how afterload can decrease in the presence of transvalvular obstruction like aortic stenosis. Like that has to be major deciding factor, no?",

        "body": "The question is wrong. U-World often is when it comes to some technical concepts. Blood pressure and after load are two different things. Afterload, from the standpoint of a pure basic-science physiologist, is the tensile force against which a muscle actively contracts. Because the heart is a complex geometric structure with sarcomeres oriented in all kinds of directions, it’s extraordinarily difficult to precisely measure afterload of the heart according to this technical definition, because the axis of contraction of each sarcomere is a little bit different. The physiologic extrapolation that we accept in cardiology is that systemic vascular resistance is more or less equivalent to left ventricular afterload (obviously this ignores the contribution of any aortic stenosis or coarctation, but for a young healthy exercising athlete these are usually irrelevant anyway).\n\nBlood pressure is not afterload, and afterload is not blood pressure. The reason these are different is because the relationship between systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure depends on the cardiac output. If cardiac output is fixed, a drop in SVR will yield a drop in blood pressure, and a rise in SVR will yield a rise in blood pressure. However, real hemodynamics are interdependent; preload, afterload, contractility, and cardiac output all change depending on how the others change; they never change purely in isolation. A change in afterload will yield a change in cardiac output in an actual person, and it may or may not change the blood pressure. As @dayinthewarmsun described, the relationship between systemic vascular resistance (SVR), cardiac output (CO), right atrial pressure (RAP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) can be described mathematically:\n\nMAP - RAP = CO x SVR. In a healthy person, RAP is usually pretty small compared to MAP, so it’s often ignored, simplifying this to MAP = CO x SVR. SVR, in this equation, is more or less synonymous with “afterload.”\n\nSo what happens to blood pressure when SVR drops? Well, that depends on what happens to the cardiac output! Usually, in response to a reduction in afterload, the cardiac output goes up. With one variable dropping and the other rising, the change in MAP will depend on whether the change in CO outweighs the change in SVR, or vice versa. During isotonic aerobic exercise (swimming, biking, running, rowing - continuous, sustained submaximal effort), the main job of the heart is to increase the delivery of oxygen to aerobically active muscle. At the same time, due to local metabolic effects, the arterioles in working muscle dilate, facilitating the delivery of oxygen. The combined effect is a drop in systemic vascular resistance (afterload), along with a substantial rise in cardiac output multiple times above baseline resting CO. So, what happens to blood pressure? It depends which change is dominant, the drop in SVR or the rise in CO! In healthy individuals, in the vast majority of circumstances, the rise in cardiac output outweighs the drop in SVR, resulting in a rise in blood pressure. This physiology is very well studied and well documented in athletes of multiple skill levels - there is no ambiguity here. Aerobic exercise yields a drop in SVR (afterload), a substantial rise in CO, and a rise in mean arterial pressure.\n\nWhat about isometric exercise? e.g. powerlifting? Sprinting? In this case, the physiology is different. Maximally contracting muscle squeezes blood vessels very tightly, clamping them down and raising systemic vascular resistance (afterload). The heart’s job in these circumstances is not to increase oxygen delivery but to do everything it can to maintain baseline cardiac output in the face of this increased afterload. The result is that cardiac output stays fairly steady while systemic vascular resistance increases substantially. Blood pressure, as you can imagine, goes up really high. Powerlifters participating in experimental measurements have demonstrated arterial blood pressures as high as 400mmHg systolic during maximal effort lifts (can you imagine? The human body withstands that and even benefits from the exercise! Crazy).\n\nSo, to reiterate, blood pressure is not afterload and afterload is not blood pressure. Afterload is most closely measured by systemic vascular resistance, which requires a measurement of cardiac output. The only way we can predict how a change in SVR (afterload) impacts blood pressure is by understanding how cardiac output is changing at the same time. Measuring blood pressure in isolation, without understanding what’s going on with other hemodynamic variables, is insufficient for measuring afterload. \n\nWhen we take care of patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy in the intensive care unit, sometimes their blood pressure is borderline (90/50), and we place a pulmonary artery catheter to measure filling pressures and estimate cardiac output. We often encounter a scenario in which the cardiac output is quite low and the systemic vascular resistance is quite high, even while the blood pressure is 90/50. What do we do for these patients? We give them sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator! The SVR drops, and often the cardiac output goes up. In many cases the blood pressure stays the same or even paradoxically goes up, as the rise in cardiac output outweighs the drop in SVR. When we remeasure the parameters, we find that the cardiac output is higher and the SVR is lower - even while the blood pressure is the same or a little higher. This is a physiologic response of a sick heart to afterload reduction. Thus, again, afterload =/= MAP.\n\nU-world is a great study tool but it’s not gospel. Cheers.",

IMHO if a particular test throws off the less experienced and leads them down the wrong path, we should limit its use. The test has so many limitations and exceptions but everyone wants to take it on face value and mistreat patients when all else points to the opposite direction. It’s like this relatively new low specificity troponin I, Lord that lab has become so worthless I want to pull out the four hairs left on my head.",

Now To compare it with previous study ask open evidence to look for similar trial in the past. you can be as detailed as you want at any level (e.g you can ask to compare inclusion criteria of X amount of trial or to make a table of their outcomes, of course it's advised to double check) . If you have more time you can get all the articles/trials of choice and put it into AI app like notebook LM and ask it direct question, I usually do that will guidelines, and it will only try to answer from that documents.

I was told that a benefit of Pradaxa over some other options is that the rapid reversal agent idarucizumab can be given before emergency surgery or an invasive procedure. Is this true for Eliquis and Xarelto as well? The other positive experiences I’ve had with Pradaxa are that the electrophysiologist who did my ablation did the procedure with no dosage adjustment. He said that he took precautions with some other anticoagulants but generally not with Pradaxa. And, I had dental surgery with minimal complications, just halted Pradaxa for two days before the procedure and the day of the procedure. It was a seamless experience. I can get any medication I want. Price is not an issue. My cardiologists seem to prefer Pradaxa. What are they missing?",

One thing that doesn't get documented with Xarelto or Eliquis as much is predisposing you to skin inflammation. The doctors labelled it as  psoriasis (autoimmune disorder) but being on those two medications increased my psoriasis SO MUCH, mainly on my legs up to the thighs. Xarelto caused more itchiness than Eliquis. Taking warfarin and Pradaxa never caused those issues for me. Pradaxa isn't bad, although i have more diarrhea episodes while taking it. I may go back to it, to save myself from having to apply all these corticosteroids and generally cheaper with insurance. The rest of the thread has been really thorough about the efficacy though.",

A few suggestions/recommendations below:\n- be a good internist before thinking about cardiology. Seriously though: card PDs don’t care how good you are in cards they will teach you that. They want the best internal medicine doc in their program bc they can’t teach the basics. It’s a cliche but it’s true \n- ECG made easy by Dubin is great \n- Pathophysiology of the heart by Lilly \n- clinical textbook of hemodynamics by ragosta \n- some sort of manual or quick reference book (I personally prefer manual of cardiovascular medicine by Cleveland Clinic) \n- keep it simple: better to know a few resources well than have too many options and be paralyzed. General rule of thumb: if you need 2 hands to count the number of resources you’re using, you need to simplify \n\nBest of luck and have fun!",

Sure, some people with traditional training histories have done extremely well. However, there are a lot of people with nontraditional backgrounds who end up as highly respected specialists or in important leadership roles.\n\nYou’re right, time does go by anyway. I have always had the philosophy that it truly important to find that whatever you’re doing is meaningful, even if you’re working towards a future goal.\n\nMedical training, as you know, it is very long. Because of that, it’s pretty important for everyone to balance sacrifices and benefits of further training. However, I think it is extremely important for most people to do something that is interesting and meaningful to them.  Personally, I would rather start a cardiology career in my early 40s then start a hospitalist or a primary care career in my mid 30s. However, this will be different for everybody.\n\nI completely understand that many people are in situations where they have to make decisions based on immediate income needs, family needs, etc. Those are very real, and often honorable, reasons to make career choices. However, otherwise, I believe it is extremely important to find a career that you find fulfilling and meaningful (bonus point if you also enjoy it). For me, cardiology absolutely is that sort of career.\n\nI definitely considered a lot of other possible careers along the way. This included careers outside of medicine. Once in medicine, I definitely considered careers outside of internal medicine and other specialties within internal medicine before choosing cardiology. When I started cardiology fellowship, I had no intention of becoming an interventional cardiologist. However, I really enjoyed my collaborations and the type of work that ICs do.",

The big thing cards fellowship is looking for is 1) first author research and 2) strong letters of recommendations from cards people (and it helps if they have nice titles).  \n\nI think the big thing in residency is finding a project and getting it done.  My intern year I figured I could either do step 3 or start a research project, so I did a project my intern year and did step 3 my PGY2 year.  I recommend this path because there is always a chance your project doesn't go anywhere and can't be published.  If you're a PGY1 and your project fall through... well you can do something your second year.  But if you don't start research until your second year and then your project falls through... then you are in a very difficult spot.  \n\nAnd then you need letters of rec and you need them from people who will write really nice letters, not just generic stuff.  I'm 3 years out from the application process, but as I remember you usually need 3 letters (there were a couple random programs that said 4 letters but it was rare.  Your letters usually come from 1) your PD, so this is usually a generic whatever letter.  2) someone else and 3) a cardiologist.  At least one of them needs to be a cardiologist.  My letters were from my PD, a pulm crit attending who I kicked ass with and then a cards attending that I worked with a lot.\n\nMost intern year schedules are pretty much set in stone, but when you're on a cards service, make sure you're doing all the right things (engaging, taking on challenges, asking appropriate questions without being obnoxious).\n\nAs a PGY2 most programs will give you flexibility in scheduling electives.  Obviously use them to do cards rotations.  Ideally your rotation gets you some consistent face time with an attending so you'd be able to get your LOR.  \n\nIf you are a resident and you want to stay at your home institution for fellowship, make sure the fellows like you.  When the attending and fellow are alone, the attending asks if the fellow likes the residents.  If the fellow doesn't like you, your candidacy at the program probably ends there.",

    "selftext": "I’m about four months from starting my cardiology fellowship, and I’ve been trying to get a solid grasp on the key cardiology guidelines and the landmark clinical trials that shape them. But, I’ve found there aren’t many good resources that help tie everything together in a structured, easy-to-remember way.\n\nSo, over the past year, I’ve been working on an Anki deck (link below) to organize and reinforce these concepts. My hope is that this resource will be useful for other residents and fellows who want to understand the guidelines efficiently.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to share with co-residents and fellows!\n\nI do have some disclaimers\n\n* This deck is far from comprehensive, but it does focus on the clinical trials that come up on rounds over and over\n* The content is designed for a cardiology-bound PGY2/3, an early cardiology fellow, or a medicine attending trying to understand cardiology recs (medical students or early interns may find this too dense)\n* I’m sure there are many mistakes hidden within the deck; if you find any, please reach out to me, and I will edit\n* Feel free to use this as a reference, but I also have instructions (below) for how to best use the deck\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**1. Suspend all cards.**\n\n**2. Select a guideline.** Choose one of the eleven guidelines (e.g., Revascularization) to begin.\n\n**3. Choose a section.** Within the selected guideline, identify a section and unsuspend all cards from the trials that fall under it.\n\n**4. Learn the cards.** Study all the cards in that section until you’re confident with them.\n\n**5. Move to another section.** Once you’ve mastered a section, unsuspend a different section within the same guideline.\n\n**6. Repeat until complete.** Continue this process—working through all sections of a guideline before moving to a new guideline—until you've learned all the cards.\n\n  \n[https://www.mediafire.com/file/xblatqx9syq64ic/ROMA\\_deck\\_v2.4.apkg/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xblatqx9syq64ic/ROMA_deck_v2.4.apkg/file)",

I recently got my CET so our office could continue to place holter monitors and do our stress tests. Our previous CET moved out of state so it was a quick transition. I am looking to further my education and my career. I love interpreting the holter reports. I have done some extensive google searching trying to understand what the next step up is, but have just gotten more confused. I have seen a CCT or a CRAT, but I haven’t been able to find a direct answer as to what those jobs do on a day to day basis. I eventually want to be able to work from home interpreting holter reports working for some company like iRhythm or Phillips. If anyone could please help break down the cardiology “food chain”, I would greatly appreciate it ❤️",

If you have an area in mind, there is no harm at all in reaching out to groups in that area and letting them know that that is where you would like to be.  This will give you an excellent shot at finding a great job.\n\nFor the most part, it is currently a lot easier to find a job in general cardiology that it is in IC and (especially) in EP.  At my primary hospital, there are 3 cardiology groups.  Two have hired a general cardiologist in the last year and the other is actively recruiting.  Since the last EP and IC were hired by anyone at the hospital (both \\~3 years ago) there have been 5 general cardiology hires.  No active need here for IC or EP.  This is not uncommon.  However, I would still not shy away from sub-specializing if it is what you want to do.",

                "body": "I am an IC.  The main thing with IC, if you want to maximize marketability for a job, is not to be too specific about what you want.  Most groups at this point that want to hire ICs are looking for someone who can help with STEMI and coverage of urgent cases.  Basically, they need to decrease call burden.  They will likely be willing to share PCI volume with you to be able to get a reasonable call schedule.  \n\nICs that are looking for structural jobs are in the worst position, as most places that are appropriate for structural cardiologists already have ICs sufficient to support the volume.  When we interview, we pretty much always turn down people that are looking for structural jobs because we don’t have the excess volume to expand beyond our current structural operators.  I like many of the structural applicants, I just know I can’t provide what they are looking for.  The market is saturated.\n\nPeople looking for CHIP or CTO jobs also have a very tough time.  These procedures are generally loss leaders for institutions (both practice groups and hospitals).  This means that a group or institution will generally take a loss in income if they hire you as opposed to hiring a typical interventional cardiologist. Furthermore, to be good at these procedures what you really need is not a training program, but, rather, many many cases of experience.\n\nIf you do want to specialize beyond just doing coronary cases, peripheral is the best way to go. This can be a double-edged-sword because in some locations and practice settings, potential employers know that you will be unable to get sufficient volume to support this interest. However, it is generally not seen as nearly as territorial or job-limiting as doing something like structural interventional cardiology.\n\nSo, in brief, if you want to maximize your ability to get a job as an interventional cardiologist, focus on coronaries and don’t demand too much in terms of wanting to do structural cases.\n\nHowever, in no way do I want to dissuade you from exploring structural, CTO or any other more specialized fields in cardiology. If that is really what you’re interest is, by all means, pursue it. Just be aware that you may not be able to find the ideal job with the ideal group in the ideal location.",

    "selftext": "Greetings everyone.\n\nI am looking for some feedback from those who know more about hearts than I do. \n\nI am a Paramedic and working on increasing my abilities in cardiac related areas, something I will admit is not my strong suit. \n\nToday, a discussion came up between me and a couple others relating to ACS/STEMI type cases and the utilization of Nitroglycerin infusions to reduce cardiac ischemia/infarct. The discussion progressed to talking about options if pressure begins dropping below our comfort level and the direction to head (titrating the nitro infusion lower/discontinuing it, or working to raise the blood pressure in other ways). \n\nThis led us down the path of a double infusion, one for Norepi as a pressor to increase blood flow back to the heart, the other being a Nitro infusion to maintain vasodilation. I have seen this done before, however, I do not think it is common.\n\nMy own research points to the Coronary Arterioles actually further dilating from Norepi due to a lack of Alpha 1 receptors and receiving Beta receptor stimulation, however the larger coronary arteries have a significant amount of Alpha 1 receptors and I would think they would vasoconstrict, increasing ischemia. Alternatively, Nitro works utilizing cGMP to produce vasodilation and does not rely on the Alpha/Beta system to produce results. In addition, Norepi still creates an increased cardiac workload, although not to the extent of epinephrine. Would this unwanted effect cause more harm than good if there is increased vasodilation feeding the heart? Essentially I am picturing Vasodilation occurring near/around the heart with vasoconstriction occurring in the periphery shunting more blood to the heart, increasing Oxygenation. \n\nMy thought process is to just decrease the nitro infusion if I run into an issue with pressure, however if this pressor/nitro combo can be beneficial, it may make for great discussion and improve some patient outcomes down the line. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, I am quite interested in this topic now and ready to learn whatever I can! \n\nThanks in advance!

        "body": "Cardiologist here\n\nNitro infusions are great because you’re able to get decent anginal relief without significant hypotension. A sublingual nitro tablet is around 400mcg whereas the nitro drip can be titrated by 10mcg. Sometimes people dont need much to feel better.\n\nNorepi just for the sake of uptitrating nitro is not a favored strategy. As you mentioned, all the beta stimulation in particular increases myocardial oxygen demand. In the setting of ACS this is promoting more ischemia and can lower your threshold for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. \n\nIf youre on a nitro drip and the blood pressures dropping I would 100% favor backing off on the nitro before adding norepi for this reason. \n\nThe selectivity youre proposing is sound from a theoretical standpoint, but in clinical practice I dont think it would be a sound strategy - particularly when considering arrhythmic potential.\n\nHappy to answer more/clarify as needed",

        "body": "I’m back with another AI summary, this time from Grok4.  Thoughts? AI seem to be getting better? \n\nInteresting ECG! Definitely not AF—the rhythm is regularly regular with a ventricular rate around 150 bpm, which rules out the irregularly irregular pattern of AF. The narrow QRS complexes point to a supraventricular origin.\nLooking at the rhythm strips (V1, II, V5), it starts with a few sinus beats showing some variability (sinus arrhythmia?), followed by what looks like a PAC—note the early, slightly different P wave morphology—then abrupt onset of the tachycardia. This sudden initiation is classic for a re-entrant mechanism. ￼ No gradual acceleration like sinus tach.\nFor atrial flutter: The rate fits (atrial ~300 bpm with 2:1 AV block giving ~150 ventricular), but I don’t see the telltale sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF)—the baseline looks pretty isoelectric there. ￼ In V1, there might be some subtle notching, but it’s not convincing for the upright flutter waves you’d expect in typical counterclockwise flutter. ￼ If it were flutter with variable block, it’d be irregular, but this is rock-steady regular.\nThat leaves re-entrant SVT, and AVNRT seems spot-on. During the tachycardia, P waves aren’t clearly visible before the QRS, suggesting they’re either buried in the QRS or retrograde right after. Check V1: there’s a small positive deflection at the end of the QRS (pseudo-r’ wave?), which is a hallmark of typical slow-fast AVNRT where retrograde conduction up the fast pathway hides the P in or just after the QRS (short RP interval). ￼ No long RP with inverted P waves post-QRS like in atypical fast-slow AVNRT. ￼\nCould be orthodromic AVRT (via accessory pathway), but that’s less common in a 57 y/o without pre-excitation on baseline ECG (assuming no delta waves here), and the pseudo-r’ leans more toward AVNRT. ￼ Junctional tachycardia is possible but usually doesn’t initiate with a PAC like this.\nClinically, the single episode of dyspnea, no recurrence after &gt;1 year, and ambulatory monitoring clean—all fits paroxysmal SVT. Treatment-wise, if it was misread as AF, they might’ve considered anticoagulation unnecessarily, but good that you agree with the management (observation? beta-blockers?).\nIf this were in clinic, adenosine would’ve been diagnostic: it’d likely terminate AVNRT abruptly or unmask flutter waves if present. ￼ Great case for learning—thanks for sharing!\nDisclaimer: Grok is not a doctor; please consult one.

        "body": "Just posted it to grok and here is what it said: I can help analyze this 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram) and provide a detailed description based on my knowledge. However, I must emphasize that I am not a medical professional, and this analysis is for informational purposes only. A qualified cardiologist or physician should always be consulted for an accurate diagnosis and interpretation of an ECG.\nECG Analysis and Description\nGeneral Overview:\nThis is a standard 12-lead ECG, displaying the electrical activity of the heart from different angles. The leads are labeled as follows: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1 through V6. Each lead provides a unique perspective of the heart’s electrical activity, helping to identify abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, and potential ischemic changes.\nKey Observations:\n\t1\tRhythm and Rate:\n\t◦\tThe rhythm appears regular, with consistent R-R intervals across all leads.\n\t◦\tTo estimate the heart rate, we can use the “300 rule” (dividing 300 by the number of large squares between two consecutive R waves). In lead II, there are approximately 5 large squares between R waves, suggesting a heart rate of about 300 ÷ 5 = 60 beats per minute (bpm). This is within the normal range (60–100 bpm).\n\t2\tP Waves:\n\t◦\tP waves are visible before each QRS complex, indicating sinus rhythm (the normal electrical impulse originates from the sinoatrial node).\n\t◦\tThe P waves appear upright in leads I, II, and aVF, which is consistent with a normal sinus rhythm.\n\t3\tPR Interval:\n\t◦\tThe PR interval (from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex) appears to be within the normal range of 120–200 ms (3–5 small squares). Measuring in lead II, it looks to be around 4 small squares (160 ms), which is normal.\n\t4\tQRS Complex:\n\t◦\tThe QRS duration appears normal, less than 120 ms (3 small squares). In lead II, the QRS complex spans about 2 small squares (80 ms), which is within normal limits.\n\t◦\tThere is no evidence of a bundle branch block (which would widen the QRS complex).\n\t5\tST Segment and T Waves:\n\t◦\tThe ST segments in most leads appear to be at baseline (isoelectric), which is normal. There is no significant ST elevation or depression that would suggest acute ischemia or infarction.\n\t◦\tT waves are upright in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, and V3–V6, which is normal. In leads V1 and V2, the T waves are slightly inverted, which can be normal in these leads, especially in healthy individuals (particularly younger patients or those with a rightward axis).\n\t6\tQ Waves:\n\t◦\tThere are no significant pathological Q waves (deep and wide Q waves that might indicate a prior myocardial infarction). Small Q waves in leads III and aVF may be normal, especially if they are less than 1 small square wide and less than 25% of the R wave height.\n\t7\tAxis:\n\t◦\tThe electrical axis can be estimated by looking at the QRS complex in leads I and aVF.\n\t▪\tLead I: The QRS is predominantly positive.\n\t▪\tLead aVF: The QRS is also predominantly positive.\n\t◦\tThis suggests a normal axis (between 0° and +90°), which is typical in healthy individuals.\n\t8\tLeads V1–V6 (Precordial Leads):\n\t◦\tThere is a normal R-wave progression across the precordial leads (V1–V6). The R wave amplitude increases progressively from V1 to V4/V5, and the S wave diminishes, which is a normal finding.\n\t◦\tNo evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) based on the R and S wave amplitudes.\n\t9\tOther Findings:\n\t◦\tThere are no obvious signs of arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia.\n\t◦\tNo evidence of Brugada syndrome (coved-type ST elevation in V1–V3) or long QT syndrome (QT interval appears within normal limits, though exact measurement would require more precise calculation).\nSummary:\nThis ECG appears to show a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 60 bpm. The PR interval, QRS duration, and ST segments are within normal limits. The axis is normal, and there is appropriate R-wave progression in the precordial leads. There are no obvious signs of acute ischemia, infarction, or significant arrhythmias. The slight T-wave inversion in V1–V2 may be a normal variant, especially in younger individuals or those with a more vertical heart position.\nRecommendations:\nWhile this ECG appears largely normal, a few points should be considered:\n\t•\tIf the patient has symptoms (e.g., chest pain, palpitations, or syncope), further evaluation may be warranted, even with a normal ECG.\n\t•\tComparison with previous ECGs (if available) can help identify subtle changes over time.\n\t•\tClinical correlation is essential—factors like age, medical history, and symptoms should guide further interpretation.\nIf you’d like a more detailed analysis (e.g., exact measurements of intervals or comparison with specific criteria for conditions like LVH), or if you have additional context about the patient, let me know! I can also search for more information if needed to refine the interpretation. However, for a definitive medical diagnosis, please consult a healthcare professional.",

The issue is, before I make a decision I want to know all the areas of cardiology to help steer me towards a specific role allowing me to decide whether or not I should complete a masters or a mbbs.\n\nThe reason I say this as I have looked at roles such as an echocardiographer which requires only a masters here in the uk. However, before I decide I want to know what roles there are within cardiology in case there is something else I want to do which would require me to take the medical route. \n\nHope this makes sense!

        "body": "If you are in the UK and have an interest in a career in Cardiology without becoming a doctor or doing graduate entry medicine, then I would recommend looking into the Scientist Training Program (STP) or the Echocardiographer Training program (ETP). Both are run by the National School of Healthcare Science and Health Education England. \n\nOn completion of the STP you will have a master's degree in Clinical science, paid for by Health Education England (if I'm not mistaken, but in any case you certainly do not pay for it yourself), and you train on a full band 6 salary. With the degree you are eligible to register with the Health and Care Professional Council as a Clinical Scientist.  You cover all the basics of cardiology diagnostics as a cardiac physiologist from ECGs and ambulatory monitoring, to the more advanced cardiac implantable devices and/or echocardiography. You work toward achieving accreditation in either echo or devices which will make you eligible for a band 7 post. Once you have finished your STP training there is nothing stopping you from achieving accreditation in the other specialism if your hospital accommodates the further training. It's 3 years to complete at the hospital in which you obtain a place with block release for the university portion (currently Newcastle Uni and Manchester Metropolitan unis provide the MSc course). This is obviously quite competitive given the pay while you train, and I may be biased as this was the route I took, but it offers an excellent career route with lots of progression and varied opportunities. I currently do 60% echo with the other 40% doing basic pacemaker follow up and implants, cath lab, and I also run a scientist-led rapid access chest pain clinic. \n\nThe ETP is more direct and a newer programme. You train for 18 months at band 6 focussing solely on gaining skills in echocardiography and achieving British Society of Echocardiography accreditation. This is obviously a quicker route to completion but you do not complete a masters degree, I think it's a diploma level. As such, you cannot register with the Health and Care Professionals Council which somewhat limits career progression opportunities. I do not want to disrespect the ETP or those who have completed it but the clinical knowledge of ETPs varies quite a lot depending on their prior experience. Some have entered the ETP having been cardiographers or physiologists first. Therefore they have good ECG interpretation skills at the very least and some relevant clinical knowledge and experience. While others have entered straight out of a basic science or biomedical science background and, while being technically proficient echocardiographers, lack some even basic ECG knowledge or understanding of the wider clinical implications of a patient's background or their echo findings. I have some colleagues who completed the ETP that are excellent both technically and clinically and others who could not identify barn door atrial flutter on an ECG (a true story) . Being only echo trained also limits any variety within cardiac physiology and with it being quite physically intense on your back neck and shoulders, should you find yourself unable to scan, you don't have much room for manoeuvre elsewhere (unless of course you already come from a cardiac  physiology background). For example, I have developed tendonitis in my elbow from when I was scanning more often but I am able to scale back my scanning time to do more pacemaker follow up and implants. \n\nI am sorry for the long post but I thought it may benefit any other UK people in a similar position to you who is considering a career in Cardiology but not specifically as a doctor or nurse. It's a wonderful career, we work closely with the doctors, nurses and radiologists, we see patients and have a direct involvement in their care, and have a very good work-life balance (99% mon-fri 9-5 or thereabouts with the exception of call if you are in the cath lab). \n\nFeel free to message me OP if there is anything else you would like to know. Good luck with whatever it is you do decide to do anyway!",

Focus on putting those guidelines into practice and becoming comfortable with them before trying to tackle everything else.\n\nSome attendings would say, “For these two days, just focus on really mastering chamber quantification.” Once you become proficient in that, move on to valves, prosthetic valves, diastology, pericardial disease, and so on. As you progress through the different ASE guidelines, you continue building your skill set until you’re comfortable reading the whole study. \n\nIt’s also helpful to do bedside echos while on call—make your own assessment first, then compare it to the official report. You can scan with the echo techs and do the same comparison.\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with interpretation, work on efficiency. Develop a systematic approach for each echo so you can mentally check off key findings as you go. If you follow the same process every time, you’ll reduce the risk of missing anything.\n\nMost importantly, make sure that everything makes physiological sense. Echo findings should align with the clinical picture. If something seems inconsistent, take a closer look. For example, if you’re seeing severe mitral regurgitation but the left atrium isn’t enlarged, reconsider your measurements—was PISA measured correctly? Was the LA measured on-axis? Double-check to confirm it all “makes sense”.\n\nFinally, ASE has an app called EchoGuide, which includes all the guidelines along with built-in calculators to help you out. It’s a great resource that I still use daily to double-check myself. Bonus: It works in a web browser, so you can pull it up alongside the echo you’re reading.",

                "body": "Good points. Not the original question but a more recent change in practice is to do TEEs even on uninterrupted anticoagulants for over 3 weeks. I’m not sure that practice is evidence backed. It could be argued that people who have already been on uninterrupted anticoagulation are at low risk regardless and the TEE adds unnecessary risk.\n\nThere have been several studies that have shown a higher than expected incidence of thrombi, even on anticoagulants. However, the presence or absence of a thrombus is a surrogate marker for embolic risk. The evidence we have shows that the incidence of stroke is very low in this population and similar with and without TEE. The fact that if we look, we find thrombi much more often (around 7 times) than the clinical events seen without looking-shows that the risk of stroke is low on anticoagulation, probably even if a thrombus is present. The risk is also not completely eliminated with a negative TEE on anticoagulation, in fact it’s debatable if it is reduced at all.\n\nThe risks of a TEE that are not as well captured in the studies are the findings that end up deferring the cardioversion (questionable thrombi, pectinate muscles, Coumadin ridge artifacts, smoke, even thrombi that may otherwise be clinically irrelevant). Now you end up in a position where you have to defer cardioversion,  leaving a pt at risk from tachycardia. But also often end up with increased anticoagulation and repeat TEEs compounding the risks. \n\nThe question should be whether or not a TEE in this situation reduces stroke/embolic risk, not whether or not it may show a thrombus. Would be a good question for a contemporary RCT to address. I found this to be a good editorial on the subject. \n\nhttps://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.04.034",

You can’t just take any CTA chest to look at the appendage. Contrast timing is important. Gating of acquisition (synchronization of image capture with the ECG to mitigate motion/step artifact) is important. Some patients with atrial fibrillation have poor left atrial contractility, resulting in slow opacification of the left atrial appendage. As a result, the contrast may “swirl” in the appendage or incompletely fill it, which can produce a filling defect that looks like a clot. A good technologist/physician team must recognize this when it occurs and, if needed, wait another 90 seconds or so for the contrast to circulate + distribute, then acquire another set of images to see if a filling defect persists in the appendage.\n\nAs a corollary, poor atrial contractility can also affect the appearance of the appendage on TEE. There maybe “smoke” (spontaneous echo contrast) or “sludge” (amorphous gelatinous-appearing material suggestive of incomplete clot formation but not definitive for organized thrombus). Sometimes it’s necessary to administer something like isoproterenol to stimulate atrial contractility a little bit, to see if the smoke/sludge disappears or not. Sometimes intravenous definity contrast is necessary to see if there is a filling defect in the appendage. It can get to be a bit subjective, it’s not always “big clot” or “totally clear.”",

The CTA appeared to demonstrate mild to moderate CAD which is why patient was sent for cath. That’s much less absurd than sending to cath after abnormal CAC score. The authors argue the CTA should have never been done. The case they present is a 48 year old obese woman with HTN who was having atypical chest pain.\n\nIn today’s litigious climate, I can’t imagine any cardiologist at least not ordering a stress test on someone like this. The authors seem to suggest that the patient should have been reassured that she had no CAD based on atypical symptoms and absence of risk factors. I think in other parts of the world this would fly, but not in the US. While it would be unusual, this patient could rupture a plaque and present with a STEMI at any point, and the cardiologist would be blamed.\n\nWith that being said, patients are very demanding these days and feel like they are doctors more than ever before now that they can ask ChatGPT anything they want. They always assume more testing is better. In the past you could reassure a patient and they would believe you, but now they will go down rabbit holes with Google and AI and never be reassured. This case report might be very nice to share with such patients to reiterate that over-testing can have devastating consequences.",

CT and RPVI? A lot of the 2nd and 3rd years at my program are creating a lot of hysteria by saying you absolutely need these boards to get a job. But i'm pushing back on that. \n\nIf you're going private practice reading CTs and vascular studies isn't worth it. You make more money seeing patients or reading nucs. Also the private practice group has to have access to a CT scanner. And even with CT who reads the extra-cardiac findings? \n\nI can see interventional fellows doing RPVI, but i don't really think it's worth it for general fellows. Maybe if you join a practice that has vascular doctors you can diversify the workload and read those studies? But in all honestly they're gonna give you the boring, tedious, poorly reimbursed ones. \n\nSpeaking to recent fellows who have graduated and gone into work CT and RPVI isn't something sought out after in private practice or academics (where you'll have either imaging trained cardiologist, radiologist or vascular surgeons handling those studies).\n\nTo me it just seems like high school again where everyone was saying they're taking 20+ AP classes and some were nonsensical ones you never used like AP Human Geography. \n\nBut based on my googling, talking to some graduated fellows and attendings in the private practice world outside of echo and nuc, you don't really need to take other boards.",

I decided to take the boards inspite barely getting any time to study. \n\nI did well on day 1 even with minimal studying. Day 2 since I didn't prep much was ultra conservative in coding. ECGs and angiograms I was within passing SD but echoes I scored really low and ultimately failed. I did ecg source as much as i could. I never did O Keefe. Just started doing them but man they make me feel like I coded very little in the exam. \n\nI was shattered. I have never failed a test in my life and was top of my med school and did well in all my ITEs. What hurt the most is I cleared echo boards with relative ease. Imposter syndrome is at an all time high. I'm starting my job in 6 months. In the grand scheme of things it might be small but still every day I get this feeling that I messed up. ",

One day when I was attempting to access the ostium of the right coronary artery, my attending, a short but tough French Canadian, who had saved more lives than anybody else in the city, snapped in his French Canadian accent STOP! Then he said “what is it you are doing?” I told him I was trying to get into the right coronary artery. He replied, “either you are lying, or you don’t know what the fuck you are doing…which is it?” By the end of my fellowship, a couple of years later, he was giving me his box seats to baseball games and asked me to stay on staff.",

We noticed a sharp decrease in pressures and saw they had developed a pretty big effusion on ICE. We attempted to drain the effusion via pericardial tap. After an hour of draining fluid and no change in effusion size, we realized it was a losing battle and needed to get the patient down to the OR. As we were preparing to get the pt off the table, they went into PEA and VT as they were full tamponade at this point. We started compressions (my first time doing CPR) and the CT surgeons rushed into the lab. At this point there must have been 20 ppl in the lab as they were getting ready for an emergency sternotomy. Ended up cracking the chest right there in the EP lab and go in to stop the bleeding. Once pt was stable enough, he was taken down to the OR where he received an atriaclip. Pt made a full recovery. Very hectic, especially as this was my first time being in a code. So… CT surgeons do work with cardiologist sometimes.",

In the community I have heard of cardiologists doing intraop TEEs if there isn’t a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist but I think most high volume centers don’t do this. Interventional/structural works a lot with CT surgery on deciding on PCI/CABG, TAVR/SAVR, pre op or post op (I.e graft evaluations, button implant evals) coronary angiograms, and then CT surgery will provide support if there are complications with percutaneous procedures. Transplant/HF cards and CT surgery work very closely in deciding on treatment/managing end stage HF patients and supporting them to and through transplant or LVAD. Our EP department does a lot of management of peri op arrhythmia issues (pacemakers, post op afib). But obviously most of these are not necessary intraop support.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nI am a PGY2 IMG from a community hospital interested in cardiology fellowship. I have completed MPH and did postdoc in CV imaging at JHU. I cowrote a grant, have publications and did many oral presentations at AHA and ACC as well. I am now set to do away rotation at few places. I am also part of ACC IM cardiology program. Also received few awards, recently, best intern award in my program.\nMy red flags though: community program, visa requiring, step 1 attempt but passed the rest. \nI need some guidance and advice from fellows and  cardiologists.\n1. What do you think are my chances of matching? I am not picky with location or program. \n2. What should I do to maximize my chances?\n3. I have a possible away rotation that I can schedule in the month of Oct- Nov in an university program. Is that a good time to do an away rotation? I am not sure if it will help me get IV at that program this 2026 cycle. Would there still be a chance for them to give me an IV or better yet rank me, if I do well, ofcourse? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you for your time.   ",

Pacemaker cells also lack sarcomeres and therefore do not undergo the heavily ATP-involved process of sarcomere contraction like myocytes do. What else is left for this cell type to consume ATP with? The Cell cycle or any repair? These are highly specialized neurons that remain in G0, and neurons can take up to 80 years to undergo just one cycle. As such, they have their own 'energy profile' so to speak\"\n\nContrast with cardiac myocytes, which are some of the most metabolically active cells in the entire body (the coronary sinus has the lowest O2 concentration of any vessel in the body). A completely different cell line, that actually has sarcomeres, that relies heavily on ATP.\n\nThis ultimately means that pacemaker cells can go longer in ischemia vs myocytes, and that for pacemaker cells to become dysfunctional, its gotta be from another pathology (i.e an electrical feedback mechanism). This explains how the Bundle of Kent causes WPW, and how AVNRT's work. It doesn't mean that nodes can't be ischemic, but that they last longer in ischemia vs myocytes. So then, how do MI's cause arrhythmias?\n\nAny type of myocyte necrosis will cause leakage of electrolytes in specified patterns.\n\n* ↓ O2 reaches to mitochondria → ↓ ATP production\n* ↓ or Absent ATP → many transport channels in a cell stop working (particularly Na/K ATPases)\n* ↓ Na/K ATPase activity → ↑ intracellular H2O Retention\n* ↑↑ H20 Retention → Blebbing, karyorrhexis, and all that jazz → Cell Lysis\n* Cell Lysis → Spilling of electrolytic content into interstitium\n* Electrolytes in interstitium → change in nearby cell membrane voltage → EKG Changes\n\nBoth endocardial and transmural necrosis will cause an aberrant source of depolarization that will usually propagate backwards to the pacemaker nodes. Once propagated, we have alterations to the membrane voltage, and opening of channels outside of SA node firing.\n\n* Ischemia → myocyte necrosis\n* myocyte necrosis  → source of aberrant electrical activity (AEA)\n* AEA → backwards propagation → Feedback/summation with pacemaker\n* Feedback / summation → Arrythmia\n\nIt's not the ischemia of the pacemaker that's causing the arrythmia. But of course there are always exceptions.\n\nI hope this helps",

Therefore, acute ischemia/infarction is unlikely to directly impact the pacemaker cells, and arrhythmias will likely be due to electrolyte disturbances caused by myocyte death?",

But as we said, the atp cost is nowhere near the same as a myocyte which means they last longer in ischemia, and that the voltage-gated nature means they can still operate under ischemia, until you have membrane lysis.\n\nalso, technically, I dont think ATP is needed to clear calcium. \n\nSERCA is one method, but so is NCX. Digoxin blocks the Na/K atpase, which leads to high intracellular Na concentrations, which blocks NCX effect and prevents calcium efflux, thus strengthening contraction. Even if SERCA mechanism is shut off, you can get Ca clearance via NCX, which is Sodium dependent.",

Someone please correct me if the below does not work out:\n\nThe resting membrane potential of a cardiomyocyte is predominantly determined by the Na-K ATPase pump.  As resting membrane potential starts to rise in the setting of ischemia, less sodium channels are available for the sharp depolarization upstroke.  As a result, both conduction and excitation-contraction coupling (calcium induced calcium release) are dampened until they cease. Funny channel sodium current drives the pacemaking automaticity, however, if the cell is not able to repolarize sufficiently via the Na-K ATPase, Na channels will remain closed and no action potential will be able to propagate as the resting membrane potential continues to depolarize/equilibrate to zero millivolts.",

    "selftext": "Hey all, current first year fellow still trying to figure out what kind of cardiologist I what I want to focus my time on during training and what skills i want to learn. \n\nI have no interest in doing procedures like cath or EP, so I'm out on them. Literally even less interest in advanced heart failure and ever hearing the words IV milirinone with bridge to LVAD again. And no way jose on congential cardiology. \n\nWanted to ask y'alls opinions on the advanced imaging fellowships a lot of places have. \n\nI know a common sentiment is they're not necessary, and not ACGME accredited, but looking forward into what kind of practice I want to be part of and what I want my day to day responsibilities to focus on it might be worth it. \n\nI like echo (including TEE), my program allows us to get Level II nuclear numbers. I would also be interested in reading cardiac CTs and cardiac MRIs.\n\nNow asking around the faculty and 3rd year fellows at my program, reading cardiac MRIs are not worth it for private practice. Takes a lot of time, access to an MRI machine and the RVU is not worth the effort.\n\nHowever the 3rd year fellows applying for private practice have told me that a lot of practices have asked them if they're CT board certified/eligible as they read their own CTs. For reference I'm at a fellowship in Philadelphia. \n\nI wouldn't mind my day to day responsibilities to be reading echos, doing TEEs, nucs and CTs. I'm hoping if I join a private practice I can take on these responsibilities and hopefully exchange that for less inpatient consult time. I like clinic so I can keep that as a major patient facing interaction. Is that feasible? I just really detest inpatient consults and would prefer to avoid being inpatient and rounding as much as possible. \n\nWhat I don't want to end up doing is all the TEEs for TAVR, mitral clips and LAA closure devices. There's an advanced imaging guy at my institution and he literally does all the TEEs for these cases. They work this guy like a dog, and if cath lab decides to start the mitral clip at 430, well he's there until the case ends. \n\nI want to be as in control over my time as I possibly can. I don't want my time dictated by the interventionalist or the EP. So i don't want to pursue advanced imaging if I end up in a job like this.\n\nI've also talked to some faculty who took CT courses and got board certified on their own. Again, if all I really need for a good PP profile is CT proficient than it might not be worth it do a fellowship year.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy reading echos and nucs. While inherently i'm not the biggest fan of patient interaction (yes I realize now maybe i should have done radiology), I actually don't mind clinic. My fellow's clinic is well staffed, good amount of resources and attending's give us a lot of freedom to institute our plans. So going into practice I don't mind clinic responsibilities. \n\nI just really want to re-iterate I hate inpatient and want to avoid it as much as possible. \n\nThere's 1 vs 2 year advanced imaging fellowship. One year for PET/CT/MRI and the 2nd year is usually for the advanced structural TEE experience. \n\nWould love to hear everyone's thoughts. Those who decided against advanced imaging or pursued it or those who got CT boarded on their own.\n\nThank you guys!",

        "body": "My take as a general fellow who eventually decided not to do advanced imaging fellowship.\n\nI think it really depends on what you eventually want to do. If you are looking for a &gt;2 days of reading time, and if you are looking for cross sectional imaging as a big part of your portfolio and want to live in a big city, I think it’s worth it. If any of the above is “no”, I don’t think it’s worth. Personally, I enjoy clinic and TEEs but can’t see myself reading for 3-4 days a week that’s not what I signed up for when I start doing Internal Medicine. Job market for general cardiology is hotter than advanced imaging - I also find getting a skill set and not using as some above users suggested it after 6 years of PG training,  kind of waste of time. \n\nIf you’re PP-bound, I wouldn’t recommend advanced imaging either. CMR and CCT are low RVU skill sets, and most institutions either don’t have both, have both but low volume, or have both but not control both (like radiology does).\n\nMost institutions separate structural imaging and cross-sectional imaging, so you shouldn’t be worried about getting stuck in structural cases. I agree with you that structural imaging is a terrible deal for any cardiologist right now. The radiation exposure is terrible, the reimbursement is low, and the occupational hazards and lack of schedule control are the same as an interventionalist.\n\nI wouldn’t be worried about getting stuck at inpatient, most jobs I came across were actually predominantly outpatient based where the access issues lie at.\n\nIf you eventually decide to imaging fellowship - here is my take on them. As you pointed out, some good ones (NW, CCF) are two years and breaks down like you suggested. I wouldn’t do the at if you are not into structural stuff. BWH is another top program that is more cross sectional oriented and two years.\n\nI probably would have pursued a one-year CCT/CMR combined level 3 programs based on what you have indicated.",

        "body": "I think way too many fellows don’t understand how most practices work: in one way or another, you tend to be paid based on productivity.  What this means is that most of us want to read trans-thoracic echos and various types of stress tests.  It’s one of the most efficient ($/hour) things we do and it relaxes the schedule to make more time for other important things that loose money (I’m looking at you, diagnostic angiograms). Aside from salaried positions (Kaiser,  VA, county, etc.), no one is going to WANT you to read echos.  They may LET you read them, but they are taking a loss by doing that. \n\nIn my opinion, you should only do an advanced imaging fellowship for two reasons: (1) You are just super interested in it to the point that you are willing to spend an extra 1-2 years in training to scratch that itch or (2) you really want to be an imaging lab director or advanced imager at a large group/institution.\n\nIn general, if you really want to be an imaging director keep in mind that it will probably not help you financially, it will limit job opportunities, and you most likely will be expected to have some sort of participation in the structural program.  To participate in structure procedure imaging (which it sounds like you want to avoid), imaging fellowship is “nice to have” but not mandatory, \n\nCMR and CT are things that groups are interested in but, outside of academic research, they don’t tend to help your career too much.  MRI machines are generally owned/controlled by radiologists and CMR is something that they generally take a financial hit by offering.  You may be able to count the number of (non-academic):cardiology groups that own MRI machines on your fingers. \n\nIt looks like CCTA is going to start paying more and you can add on CT-FFR in some cases. However, very few cardiology groups/departments own scanners (again, radiologists do) and there remains the concern of missing extracardiac findings (liability).  CT does seem to be a developing area.  However, even though I am a big fan of CT, I’m in the minority opinion who do not think that it is going to become more prominent in the future (for a few reasons).  I may be wrong. \n\nIn terms of pay: In my large teaching institution, our imaging director is paid on the same productivity scale as general cardiologists.  He also gets a nominal stipend for running the lab.  He is at about the 25-50th percentile for income among our general cardiologists.  He likes that part of the job and, especially, teaching fellows to be good at echo.  Not bad, but you can see that money is not the reason to do it\n\nMy advice: If you are super interested in imaging, really want to be the best at imaging for structural procedures and/or really want that rare imaging job running the lab: go for it!  Imaging is interesting and imaging gurus are great resources for the rest of us.  Otherwise: general cardiology is a great option.\n\nHowever:\n- On average, it will not increase your expected pay beyond general cardiology.\n- It’s still more likely than not that you either won’t be able to participate in CCTA or that you’ll take a pay cut to do so. Same, but more true, with CMR.\n- Unless it’s your passion and focus, you are unlikely to be doing/reading CMR.  \n- If you are not going to do structural procedure imaging, you are most likely to basically be a general cardiologist, even if you have this training.",

You have to work at a hospital that has all of that equipment, which is not cheap - the hospital has to have sufficient patients to make all of that hardware financially viable (doing 5 nuclear studies a week is not going to keep a nuclear lab financially solvent). Basically, you’re looking at working at large, urban medical centers; the kinds of hospitals that attract competitive job-hunters. Those with a dedicated imaging fellowship under their belt will have a competitive edge, so without the fellowship you may be looking at community centers, many of which will not have all the equipment you want. This principle applies to private practice jobs as well. This is something that applies not only to your first job, but also to subsequent job applications 5-10+ years down the line, at which time no doubt imaging training will be quite robust and possibly accredited. At that point, you will definitely be out-competed by people with fleshed-out fellowships under their belts.\n\nBasically, if you’re going to just do extra CT training, you may lose out on some opportunities. You’re probably not going to find a dedicated imaging fellowship that just does CT, but you’ll probably find one that does CT and MRI or something like that. You can do a year of training in that and then just read CT when you go into practice, but you will always have the fellowship under your belt forever - and that can be the difference between nabbing a great job you really want vs. getting edged out by someone with an extra line on their CV.",

However, I must caution that if this is a non-negotiable requirement for your job search, you’ll limit your options significantly. Most places don’t have both CCT and CMR run by cardiology or alternatively they don’t have both.

You are essentially doing 10-12 scans a day, a revolving door, however I enjoy it. \n\nPhysically you can have back/shoulder pains if you don’t be careful while scanning - try and find a centre that will allow you to scan left handed as I’m pretty sure in the long run it’s better for your body. Also doesn’t help that the general public are getting bigger and bigger so some scans really strain your arm. \n\nIt’s a nice mix of practical skills/theory with the image acquisition &amp; reporting side of things. \n\nI’m purely an echocardiographer, but if you start out in cardiac physiology your job may be more varied - ecgs, holter, exercise tests etc. Any questions lmk",

Working in clinical neurophysiology also felt the same way regardless of the center or country I was working.\n\nBut again I won't want to discourage you because if you had asked my 6/7 years ago I'd have said the reverse.

        "body": "Hi, I'm a cardiac physiologist who has specialised in echocardiography and thus, my job has been essentially echocardiography for the past 5 years.\nOverall I do like it, it is an interesting skill that will have you learn a lot about cardiac anatomy, physiology and different pathophysiology. I also find making associations of this knowledge with the imaging and the quantitative data, very satisfying and engaging.\n\nOn the other hand, depending on where you work, after a while you might find yourself bored, because you end up seeing the same pathology again and again...and again. This, I guess, is common for every job but here I find it particularly repetitive and tedious because you will be doing exactly the same views and same measurements every time and write almost the same text on your report. You will still find very interesting cases that will make you use your brain, discuss hypothesis with your colleagues, do things a bit outside of the ordinary, but those occasions will probably become less and less frequent.\n\nWhen I got to this point, I have since transitioned to paediatrics and congenital heart disease and so far I'm enjoying it a lot and it kind of re-ignited the passion for what I do (at least for now).\n\nAnother thing to consider is, as a lot of other redditors already mentioned, your physical wellbeing. This job puts a lot of stress on your shoulders and back and can lead to repetitive strain injury. If you do pursue this career I suggest you learn to scan left handed and keep a healthy lifestyle by strengthening your back muscles and (try to) keep a good posture during your scans.\n\nAs a life sustaining career, the demand for echocardiography is only getting higher and higher. It is a non-invasive test, relatively cheap, safe and provides a lot of information so there's no surprise there, you won't struggle to find a job and you can even make good money if you're willing to work a few extra hours (this might vary country to country though).\n\nWithin echocardiography there's also a few doors that can open to develop your career and get some of that job satisfaction such as transoesophageal (TOE/TEE), 3D, stress echocardiography, congenital heart disease. A lot of us are also widely sought by the industry to work as reps and application specialists so that is also another door that might open for you.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBest of luck",

My primary interest lies in Heart Failure and Advanced Heart Failure, and I’m keen to pursue further training in this subspecialty.\n\nHere’s my current situation:\n\nI am not ECFMG certified (have not taken the USMLE).\n\nI’m open to training opportunities in non-accredited programs or observerships, especially in English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, or others.\n\nMy focus is on gaining advanced clinical and practical exposure in heart failure management, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplant care.\n\n\nI’d greatly appreciate your advice on the following:\n\n1. Are there specific programs, hospitals, or institutions known for accepting international physicians for training in heart failure?\n\n\n2. What are some alternative routes for gaining advanced exposure without ECFMG certification?\n\n\n3. Any personal experiences, resources, or forums that could help me navigate this path?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions or guidance you can provide!\n",

I really appreciated his critical appraisal of cardiology studies, his \"medical conservatism\" and his willingness to challenge the KOLs and other loud voices in medicine.\n\nHowever, he seems to be becoming more of a nihilist, a luddite and a hypocrite.  \n\nI applaud medical conservatism and placing the onus of proof on those pushing new therapies, but one of the reasons that I got into cardiology is because it is an area in medicine where advances in technology has made real, meaningful differences in the lives of our patients.  How can you not look at the history of Andreas Grüntzig and others' contributions to cardiology and not be proud and excited about the audacity and ingenuity of their work?  We want new technologies and we want to use them to make a difference for our patients.\n\nHis latest take is that he is basically endorsing lower reimbursement for cardiologists because, well, I don't know why.  Maybe because he already \"got his\" and is counting down towards retirement instead of trying to make it in a world where every aspect of practicing cardiology (form the patient relationships, to the pay, to the autonomy) is posing increasingly difficult challenges.  Maybe it is because his focus is on flying around the world speaking instead of taking care of those patients that anchor the rest of us down to one location the majority of the time. Whatever it is, it seems tone deaf.\n\nHave I become too critical?  \n\nAnyone have any good podcast recommendations that focus on EBM or critical appraisal for cardiologists?",

Certainly don't agree with everything (e.g. critique for GLP analogs, hard skepticism for all new technology, often oversimplifying complex topics etc.) but honestly much of his critique is pretty fair. Also think increasing the interest for evidence based medicine in general is a good thing as much of the evidence we base our clinical decisions on is weak and questioning it difficult. Also listened to the latest episode but don't remember him supporting lower reimbursement for cardiologists - he literary stated that paying less for seeing patients \"seems dumb\", but also critiqued paying more for reading CTA's while suggesting financially incentivising practicing evidence based medicine. \n\nI try to at least briefly stay up to date with the largest journals in the field and he only covers a pretty small part of all the new trials which is problematic/end up getting too much focus so definitely can't only rely on his podcast to stay up to date. \n\nRecommendations for other podcasts: CardioNerds, Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular CME, The Lead Podcast, MedMastery Cardiology Digest, CRTOnline Podcast, NEJM This Week, HeartCorner: Innovations in Cardiovascular Science (and of course CardioNerds)",

I know these composite endpoints are a strategy to lower sample sizes and increase event rates, but should we be more tempered in our interpretation in these instances?\n\nA reliance on composite endpoints seems to represent a relatively handy way of performing these RCTs.

The justifiable reason to use a composite endpoint is to achieve an appropriately powered study in a reasonable amount of time with a smaller number of subjects. However, composite endpoints are increasingly abused for the usual reasons.\n\nFor a composite endpoint to be appropriate, the items in the composite need to be somewhat similar in (1) biological mechanism, (2) severity and (3) objectivity.\n\nFor instance, it may be appropriate to use the original 3-point \"major adverse cardiac event\" (MACE) composite endpoint of MI, CVA and CV death.  Broadly speaking, these are similar in that (1) they are mostly presumed to be caused by a vascular etiology, (2) they are all life-threatening and (3) they are all verifiable by established criteria.\n\nWhen the endpoints are dissimilar, it is extremely challenging to interpret the results and use them clinically.  For example, in FAME the composite endpoint was death, MI and revascularization.  The (1) biological mechanism leading to these might be similar.  However, (2)  revasculaization is not as severe/life-threatening as MI/death and (3) revascularization is often done with highly subjective criteria (not similar to objectivity of death or MI).

I really haven’t run into this issue, so here are some things to consider based on my general practice:\n\nI think the first thing to consider would be medication’s. I usually don’t push the beta blocker dose too high and quick to stop it if the patient has fatigue. The data for beta blockers post ACS is weak. Also consider ticagrelor, especially if the patient is feeling dyspneic. Really scrutinize any medication changes you made in general. Keep in mind that patients are far more likely to experience any side effects if they are told about them, make sure they aren’t being primed. \n\nThe second big category that I would think hard about would be your PCI patient selection and expectations. And not just you but what the patient may have been told by referring physicians also. Are you bringing patients in for possible “anginal equivalents” or non-cardiac sounding chest pain? \n\nThe third category would have to do with deconditioning. Push cardiac rehab. Don’t keep patients longer than truly necessary. Minimize any activity restrictions unless truly necessary. Also keep in mind that patients tend to feel the need to restrict themselves, or just limited by actual angina, and maybe deconditioned from this as well. All these things sound kind of obvious, but I’m not sure what your typical practice patterns are.",

I currently have a wonderful job as a general/imaging guy, and my colleagues have been very supportive of my EP plans.\n\nI'm trying to decide between:\n\n1.

My current workplace is (pseudo)academic and has an in-house Cardiology fellowship, but no EP fellowship. My colleagues already offered to keep me on as I prepare to re-apply next cycle.\n\n2. Doing a 1 year HF fellowship as a pathway to EP. Although I'm not passionate about HF, I'm curious enough about that I think I'd enjoy doing it for a year and then moving on to EP.  Question is, will it be seen favorably by EP programs? I'd probably try to do this at a place with an in-house EP fellowship.\n\n3. 1 year arrhythmia/research fellowship. Not many of these around, but found a couple. This would probably take me away from clinical medicine, which I'm not too keen about leaving.\n\n  \nThanks for your thoughts. If any of you guys do hear of an open spot later this year or next year before July, please keep me in mind!",

That being said, 2+2 will probably make the EP match more competitive in general as now the additional year of lost income is gone with this pathway.\n\nTo OP, I would highly highly recommend pursuing the research route - you can do locums/moonlighting or get a part time gig on the side doing research.

My local cardiologists (especially the trainees) seem to apply \"type 2 MI\" to any patient with even the most trivial of possible provocation. I was wondering what other people's perspective is? The 4th definition makes a distinction between myocardial injury (raised troponin) and myocardial infarction (troponin plus ST changes, new Q waves, new RWMAs) but the core mechanisms are pretty much the same - ischaemia imbalance. So I understand shock, severe hypoxia, tachy-brady arrythmias as mechanisms. But why are patients with a fever/raised markers from a UTI or LRTI but with normal saturations, normal BP and normal heart rates being called Type 2 - there is no significant increased cardiac work or impaired coronary flow in these cases. If on the other hand this is cytokine mediated upregulation of coronary inflammation and plaque events isn't it best to just call these provoked Type 1s and take them to the cath lab?",

        "body": "When I propose a diagnosis of type II NSTEMI, I am not implying the absence of coronary disease or suggesting that the coronaries are not guilty partners in the process. A supply-demand mismatch does not need to be attributed entirely to the supply side or entirely to the demand side. A longstanding, fixed, calcified coronary obstruction in a patient with chronic stable angina limits the reserve of coronary flow to its subtended vascular bed. If the reserve is only slightly limited, it takes a significant increase in demand (such as septic shock) to yield a supply-demand mismatch that raises cardiac biomarkers. If the chronic obstruction is severe, and the flow reserve is quite limited in that territory, such that even slight elevations above resting flow are impossible, then yes, something as “insignificant” as a urinary tract infection can drive up myocardial oxygen demand enough that it outpaces the local supply. If I suspect this is what’s happening, I recommend a noninvasive assessment of coronary disease, such as a nuclear stress test, after the acute demand-driving insult has resolved but before the patient gets discharged home. I also recommend treating the CAD medically with statins, aspirin, beta blockers as tolerated, etc.\n\nThink of delirium. A young patient with a lot of “brain reserve” needs to get quite sick before they become delirious. But an elderly patient with some baseline cognitive impairment can manifest significant delirium even with mild perturbations in homeostasis, such as a urinary tract infection. It’s all bout the physiologic reserve, or absence thereof.\n\nHope that helps.",

In these diseases, HF occurs due to diastolic dysfunction which leads to increased LVEDP. But as per Harrison's, other pathophysiological processes other than diastolic dysfunction is a cause for HFpEF as well. Examples include vascular stiffness, renal dysfunction, inflammation related with adiposity and more. This shows that HFpEF is not a single disease with a specific pathology, but in fact a clinical syndrome that could result from multiple pathophysiological processes, mainly diastolic dysfunction,but not exclusively that.",

Garden variety Hfpef is the most common thing we see and is an inflammatory disorder caused by age and co morbidities.

Like others above treating the underlying cause is important - which may be why GLP-1 drugs seem quite effective for these patients (although only obese HFpEF patients were included in the STEP-HFpEF trials).

HFPEF is a diagnosis when anyone gets treated by a provider with a diuretic and their EF is normal. I.e. Therefore many people are going to be misdiagnosed with the condition when they don't have it. Here is the framework: There are cardiac muscle conditions that cause HFpEF (ie Amyloid, HCM, Possibly Sarcoid, Iron overload, idiopathic (there are these idiopathic conditions where people have very stiff ventricles without any evidence of any other disease and these can be seen in families). Then there are the cardiac conditions that CAUSE abnormal filling patterns or hemodynamic consequences due to the muscle dysfunction ( valvular disease, ischemic disease, atrial fib/flutter ). Then there are the secondary causes of cardiac fibrosis that stems from systemic diseases such as long standing hypertension, diabetes, and maybe microvascular dysfunction. Lastly, there are all of the non-cardiac conditions that cause \"hfpef\" such as morbid obesity, sleep apnea, ohs, COPD exacerbations that cause diastolic dysfunction, renal failure, urinary obstructions, severe anemia. So to summarize 1) intrinsic cardiac muscle diseases 2) valvular/coronary/arrhythmias diseases leading to elevated LVEDP 3) systemic diseases that cause diastolic dysfunction and elevated LVEDP 4) non-cardiac disease that cause diastolic dysfunction and elevated LVEDP and 5) non-cardiac disease that mimic heart failure with or without elevated filling pressures.",

It is extremely unlikely that a patient would ever require three separate CABG surgeries… in the rare instance that a patient had an indication for redo CABG (with two prior CABGs), you’re looking at transplant, medical therapy, or comfort measures. \n\nAs so many others have stated, CABG x3 = Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts x3. This is all done during the same surgery. If you present this to your peers as a patient undergoing three separate CABG surgeries, you will embarrass yourself. If your professor has told you that CABG x3 is three separate surgeries then they too should be embarrassed. I am not at all trying to be rude, but you should work to accept what so many others are telling you. You’ve asked this question twice and haven’t liked the answers you’re getting. I think a wonderful lesson for any student, healthcare professional, or human being is to not operate under the assumption that you’re the most knowledgeable person in the room…. especially if the room is full of CT surgeons that you are questioning on the term “CABG x3”.",

But that's just me - I like how dynamic and fast paced the cath lab can be and buzz off working closely with the team - though many of my colleagues don't like or avoid it due to the more stressful nature of some of the cases. I also like complex pacing and EP cause it just clicks for me. Because I enjoy what I'm doing it's easy to get a focus going. And there's so much going on that I don't get bored.\n\n\nI personally avoid both stress tests and echo, mainly cause I don't enjoy talking to the same patient for 30-40 mins, so YMMV depending on your tolerance for peopling - in the dark of an echo room patients can get real chatty!\n\n\nThe most important thing is just finding a department where you get on with your colleagues IMHO; cause that will make or break your enjoyment of the job.\n\n\nTL;DR - hospital are full of people with ADHD and all else. As cardiac physiologist with ADHD, I prefer cath lab and pacing over echo as peopling tires me out and I buzz off adrenaline, but if you have a dept that you vibe with it's a great career! ",

Earning 20k RVU per year would put you above more than 90% of practicing ICs.  \n- The median annual number of PCI for IC in the US is about 50.\n- Pay varies a ton, from lower-half 6 figures well into 7 figures. \n\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n- I highly recommend that you start with a job that gives you significant PCI volume during year 1. More is better. You can’t rely on just recruiting your own PCI patients.  You need to have a stream of patients that you can do PCI on.  This means taking call or working as part of a system that can make you the “procedure person” when you are on…at least some of your week. \n- How much is “significant PCI volume” for year 1.  Obviously, if you can do a thousand, that would be great.  That’s very challenging to do.  I would aim for an absolute minimum of 100 in your first year.  I would not consider a first-job that can’t supply at least that.\n- If you are interested in any non-clinical opportunities such as administration, leadership (not to mention teaching and research), consider that larger practices (and especially large health systems) often provide a lot more opportunities.  Don’t rule out clinical jobs at academic institutions if they can give you what you need.\n- I know everyone talks about mentorship.  If you can find good mentorship, great.  That’s not always something that you can find out about a job, though.  What you need are colleagues that are willing to help you out by discussing challenging cases, helping with coverage/call and occasionally joining you for a procedure.  If the group is not microscopically small and has good camaraderie, you’ll be okay.\n- A lot of these jobs that pay at the extreme high end right away and/or make high RVUs really work you hard.  That’s not a bad thing.  However, it may not make the most sense if you want to explore non-clinical career options.  \n- Unless you are planning to take a temporary job (like working at a high volume county or VA hospital short-term to get PCI experience) do NOT take a low-paying job.  Not only will you get paid less, but many of these are scams for new-grads.",

The safest models imo these days are large established employed groups. Now that’s not to say those don’t have a ton of issues (no autonomy) but they can definitely allow you to “grow” at a slower pace. \n\nThe most volatility I see is with private practice groups still practicing a chaotic 1990/2000s practice in today’s world (rare) and/or smaller hospitals that are always fighting for coverage or having competing groups or completely clueless admin trying to exploit you with you having no protection with numbers. \n\nObviously lots of variation to that out there but beware as “small” practices can be the most chaotic and exploitative in IC - minimal shared coverage, no partners for protection, more competition, more risk with procedure, etc\n\nBut a large group (20+ docs, 5-7 ic, 700-850k with 8-12 weeks off) is what I would be targeting based on what you’re mentioning",

There is a class of EKGs that I've had trouble deciding of how I formally want to read them, and I've run into them actually quite a few times (5-10 over the past 2 months)\n\nThey typically include the following characteristics:\n\n1. Very young (i.e 15-25; I read pediatric ECGs)\n2. Relatively rightward axis (i.e. right around 90)\n3. Big giant S waves V1-V2 (i.e. &gt;30mm im V2) with small R waves (i.e. &lt;2mm)\n4. Deep, even dominant S waves in V5-V6 (i.e. R and S wave both 15mm in V6) but with normal sized R waves\n5. Other various abnormalities (i.e. biatrial enlargement, or Nonspecific T wave changes... not just isolated high voltages that is probably normal in a healthy young athletic person)\n\nIts a clearly abnormal ECG, and I think its actually a finding of LVH with an atypical pattern in the lateral leads (With a borderline RAD being more related to the patient's young age than actual RV hypertrophy). \n\nThat says, it feels off to read as LVH with dominant S waves in V5-V6; I also didnt want to read as \"possibles\" in a clearly abnormal ECG. \n\nIt doesn't matter too much from a practical standpoint, the ECGs are abnormal and in an otherwise young, healthy person will lead to a referral... this is more of an art of medicine question to those more experienced than me.\n\nIve landed on reading it as \"Ventricular hypertrophy with a non specific pattern\", but \"LVH, PO RVH\" has crossed my mind as well to not try and get too cute.

I think nonspecific ventricular hypertrophy is reasonable especially because of how bad LVH/RVH are in terms of sensitivity/ specificity. \n\n  \nMy gist would be to consider if these patients have atrial septal defects that have been missed (though 10 over a few months is way too many for that). That often presents with RAD and RBBB. Would love to hear follow up - thanks OP!",

Most of these ECGs sre coming from the Peds ED or Urgent Care, where I'm sure they have more variability of lead placement.

        "body": "There are a fair few phantom studies with detectors placed within the cranium that give good data regarding how much protection the caps provide. \n\nMain takeaways are:\n- Standard cap provides very minimal brain protection, especially for procedures where you are closer to the primary beam (eg device implants). As the distance from beam increases, the degree of protection rises slightly (eg up to 20% for some regions of the brain at femoral location). \n- Cap with ear flaps are SUPER effective, particularly in LAO where you are receiving the majority of your scatter radiation. Studies show anywhere from 70-85% reduction in left temporal lobe dose when you have a flap on your left side in the radial/femoral position. Unfortunately, they are less effective in AP (30-40%) and less effective when positioned for device implants. \n- Ceiling suspended lead shields are your no. 1 protection and placing these optimally (ie minimal gap between patient and the bottom of the shield) will make the most difference. \n- 65% of the radiation that reaches your brain enters between the level of your eyes and mouth ipsilateral to tube side, 20% at the level of your jaw/chin tube side and only 5% at forehead level. That is why standard caps are minimally effective. \n\nFor device implants, unfortunately many labs don’t have set up for ceiling suspended lead shields. So I use lead cap with lateral flaps on both sides (right side more exposed during access and left side more exposed when manipulating lead) and for CRT cases, I also wear a panoramic half-length lead visor that is tilted down so as to intercept scatter. ",

The trial was highly discussed at the recent AHA 2024 meeting and may lead to widespread changes in Afib management, which Mandrola is evidently concerned about.

From what I've seen, once patients have the LAAO procedure explained to them, with the promise (or possibility) of getting off OAC, it doesn't really take much selling. I've never taken eliquis but clearly patients really *do not* like it. However I see some borderline cases where (again, not as a doctor much less an EP physician) I see 97 year old grandma getting a watchman and I do wonder where the benefit is. If I'm 97 I don't want to spend another day in the hospital for anything if I can avoid it, at that age all-cause mortality is extremely high period, I don't want people dicking around in my heart either even if it's \"non-invasive.\" \n\nI've listened to mandrola's podcast a bit and it seems like his argument is that the patient population that would be most likely to get an actual benefit from LAAO is much smaller than the population currently getting it. So my question, and where I'm going with all this, is: what is the \"ideal\" watchman patient? is it 97 year old grandma who is otherwise pretty functional but with paroxysmal afib? and how often are OACs actually full-out stopped? Like what if you get a watchman than two weeks later oh look, a DVT... back to the pharmacy for an eliquis refill. Like there are supposedly way more indications for OAC than just afib. \n\nI'm over my head in a niche subreddit but if anyone wants to play ball with me I appreciate it",

The data with option is purely related to how the device functions when compared to medical therapy without implant related issues included. \n\nAnother is that they should have had an arm without OAC or device?  I’ll just leave this one alone on a trial with an average C2V of 3.5.\n\nOur current guidelines do not advocate stopping OAC after ablation if indicated by C2V.

        "body": "Chronic bilateral pitting edema is commonly caused by systemic issues affecting fluid balance, and evaluating its cause requires a comprehensive assessment. While normal BNP or NT-proBNP levels and echocardiography significantly reduce the likelihood of heart failure, cardiac conditions such as constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, or isolated right ventricular dysfunction may still cause edema and warrant further evaluation with advanced imaging like cardiac MRI or right heart catheterization. Renal causes, including nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema), chronic kidney disease, or acute kidney injury, should be ruled out with appropriate labs such as creatinine and urine protein levels. Hepatic causes, particularly cirrhosis, can lead to peripheral edema due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension, with accompanying features such as ascites or jaundice, which can be evaluated with liver function tests and imaging. Venous insufficiency is another common cause, especially in older adults, presenting with varicosities, leg swelling, and hemosiderin deposits, while early lymphedema may mimic pitting edema, although it is more typically non-pitting in later stages. Endocrine causes, such as hypothyroidism, or nutritional deficiencies causing hypoalbuminemia, should also be considered, particularly when clinical features like fatigue, cold intolerance, or poor dietary intake are present. Idiopathic edema, often seen in premenopausal women, is a diagnosis of exclusion and may not benefit from diuretic therapy. While furosemide can provide symptomatic relief in cases of fluid overload due to heart failure, renal dysfunction, or cirrhosis, it should be used cautiously with close monitoring of potassium levels and renal function and avoided in cases like venous insufficiency or idiopathic edema where the underlying issue is not addressed.",

Cardiology is 3 extra years, and I am seeing on reddit some insane IM salaries that aren't as good as Cards but also not even close to as much work and obviously 3 less years of grunt work. Lot more call and midnight wake ups than our GI brothers and sisters. Way more hours (?) than PCCM. I guess my fear is that I'll do all this research, put in a bunch of hours, work my ass off during fellowship, and at the end look back and think that I wasted 3 years during which I could have made doctor money and done something else w my life w all the extra time I would have had off. Do any of yall regret going into Cardiology, or those of you who finished and are now attendings, would you say it was worth it, or would you rather have done another specialty/stayed as IM?\n\n  \nPartially asking this cuz a family friend of mine who is a Cardiologist even mentioned that he would want his kid to do GI, lot more chill, more money etc. And it kinda threw me off.

Perhaps only the heavier volume jobs list numbers so one is aware of what they’re signing up for. At my academic center, the staff without a trainee assigned are seeing on average 16 patients a day so I’d imagine for practice more volume is expected but again I could be mistaken and it might be more similar after all.\n\nNot an infrequent sentiment seen regarding general call (again, in practice not academic) across many posts on Reddit, SDN. While IC call involves coming in, the number of pings overnight seem less than to general call and it depends on the setup such as is there an NP on call before you get called. Probably very job specific but again not a crazy nor infrequent sentiment seen broadly speaking regarding general call.\n\nAgreed that the day to day can be more or less similar with general doing TEEs, nucs, etc but my hesitation just comes from the limited insight I most frequently see which is online job postings. Since these rare mention TEE, RHC, CardioMems, PPM, while it is possible certainly, I don’t know how common it is and whether these types of jobs extend to more rural areas since certainly at more urban areas these may be delegated to subspecialists.\n\nI think your perspectives are very helpful and I will question whether what I am seeing is biased based on the limited visible information I come across and not reflected in true practice, so thank you. The above is just why I have come to think as such and I don’t think completely unreasonable if one didn’t have insider access to what jobs really entailed based on personal experience rather than what is posted for online job postings or forums.",

This is not a common complication of PCI in modern practice.  There may very well be something fishy going on at your institution...I just won't be someone who judges from afar. \n\n  \nAn example of a patient where PCI could be considered would be HFrEF with lesions that are all proximal, severe and type A as well as no other suspected HFrEF etiology, viability and a contraindication to CABG.  I would consider it in that situation.  \n\n  \nUnfortunately, some people do not update their practices and there is definitely the temptation to give in to  ulterior  motives. After all, PCI makes a lot more money than a diagnostic cath and if you get into Impella territory...even more. Also, if you stent a patient and they get better (even if the stent wasn't the reason) then they love you for life.  Also, sometimes it is very difficult to educate patients on the appropriate use (or when not to) of PCI.",

His whole take on DANGER-SHOCK and his butt-buddy Vinay Prasad chiming in was hilarious. \n\nREVIVED tells us that routine PCI shouldn't be performed simply solely for low EF outside of ACS. But a lot of patients end up in the hospital with ACS and have an ischemic cardiomyopathy. You have to consider whether your patient really falls into the REVIVED inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition as with many of these trials, people are often not willing to randomize the patients who stand to benefit the most. E.g. the young patient with TIMI 2 flow in the LAD and a huge territorial WMA. You have to delve into the details yourself and treat the individual patient. \n\nAnd any AKI after a cath gets attributed to the cath so that doesn't really mean much. True CIN is very rare nowadays.",

You need to look in more detail.\n\n\\- Upon reviewing REVIVED, I find it odd that they don't (at leas in an easy-to-find way) list the number of patients screened for the trial (This usually gives me a basic idea of how many people participating investigators \"thought might be in the study group\" vs the ones that actually were).\n\n\\- \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\".  This was a negative trial.  It failed to show benefit.  Furthermore, the CI for most of the interesting outcomes was clearly not decisive.  Even a \"negative trial\" can dissuade you from doing something if the outcomes imply harm.  I don't think that case can be made for this.  In essence, it showed that using a PCI strategy didn't really seem to be much different from using a medical strategy alone.  I don't think that means PCI needs to be forbidden (based on this data). \n\n\\- If you look at \"Table 2\" for the study, the only significant outcomes were secondary and were:  \n  Unplanned revascularization (favored PCI)  \n  Bleeding at one (not significant at 2) year (favored no PCI)  \n...both of these are highly problematic to hang your hat on. \n\nIf this study had shown that the primary outcome (death) were significantly worse with PCI (i.e. CI of 1.1-1.4), then I think you would have much more compelling evidence that harm is done with PCI in this setting. In fact, the treatment effect marginally favored PCI, though to a statistically and clinically insignificant degree (0.99).",

Every trial has flaws, in ischemia they changed the primary endpoint midway and it becomes a negative trial, then lo and behold on extended follow up the original primary endpoint is positive.

In fact when looking at percentage of patients with obstructive CAD by CTA, something like 6% in invasive arm didn’t have any obstructive lesions so assuming that’s balanced in the medical arm we’ve now exposed the invasive arm to procedure without possibility of benefit and the medical group without CAD was not. If you read the supplementary appendix you’ll find many patients didn’t undergo revascularization for various reasons and you will quickly realize this wasn’t a test of revascularization vs no revascularization, it is a question of do I need to cath patients with ischemia. If limited to this (which was the original intent) then it is an appropriate trial and I agree we don’t need to cath everyone with moderate ischemia, but you will find that mandrola and a lot of cardiologists presume revascularization of stable CAD does not effect mortality. This is a large population so the small percentages of patients that didn’t get revascularized or did not have actual obstructive CAD actually make a big difference if the event rates are as low as they were in this trial. Then comes the methodology issues with changing endpoints and the original endpoint actually being positive on longer term follow up but the amended one not. But this requires in depth review and analysis of the trial and many people are not willing to do that or are incentivized not to (I.e. Mandrola)",

However, I have asked some of my older colleagues some of which are quite competent in arrhythmias and they do not show this concern and say amiodarone is OK. Do any of you have any thoughts / experience / input towards this? I know flecainide can be used, and often these patients are younger without concerns of structural heart disease but flecainide is more finicky than amiodarone. Of course, there is still DC cardio version but if we want to use drugs. I have never had such a patient in real life. ",

In somebody with an accessory pathway, this would theoretically encourage conduction through the accessory tract and potentially at 1:1 conduction precipitating VF like you mentioned. \n\nNow its not everyday that you come across pre-excited AF and hence everyone's experience varies and the characteristics of the accessory pathway vary as well. In someone who has an accessory pathway with decremental conduction, the use of these agents shouldn't pose as much of a risk versus those who don't. \n\nSo in short, if you have a pathway proven to show decremental conduction, sure go ahead and use amio. In others I'd personally prefer not to risk VF.",

We waited until decannulation and then did the pathway ablation.\n\nFor stable pre-excited afib, ibutilide and procainamide should still be first line therapy. Be careful with hypotension with procainamide use and also for prolonged QT from NAPA build up in setting of renal dysfunction. I think amiodarone use in this situation comes from our comfort with amio in general and it's relative safety profile in the short term, plus also the fact that often you're not sure if its pre-excited afib vs irregular VT. Previous ESC and ACC afib guidelines in the early 200s had amiodarone as a IIb recommendation but the newer guidelines have amiodarone as III/potential to do harm, but I think generally you can get away with it given its Na and K channel affects affecting with both the AV node and bypass tract. You can always cardiovert if needed.\n\nFlecainide I would reserve for use in the chronic outpatient setting for patients with pathways that don't undergo ablation, though I think most of these we should be ablating. The peds people are certainly very aggressive with ablations. I'm not sure I would use flecainide in the acute setting for pre-excited afib if I don't know whether or not the patient has structural disease.",

Have had a situation arise a few times over the past year and was hoping to get some expert input:\n\nElderly patient (\\~70y/o) shows up with little/no prior medical care, found to have a large (7cm or more) AAA which requires relatively urgent repair (\\~25% or higher chance of rupture in 6 months, so not looking to delay surgery by much if at all). Either low functional capacity, or unable to assess due to mobility. EKG with some chronic looking changes, maybe LBBB, but nothing acute. Echo largely unremarkable. Maybe some DOE but otherwise no acute symptoms. Can be either open AAA or endovascular repair.\n\nMy questions would be:\n\n1. Would this patient benefit from cardiac consult prior to their surgery? If so, what would that look like? According to [these](https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(17)32369-8/fulltext) guidelines from Society for Vascular Surgery, this patient would qualify for cardiac risk stratification: \"In patients with significant clinical risk factors, such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and unknown or poor functional capacity (metabolic equivalent \\[MET\\] &lt; 4), who are to undergo OSR or EVAR, we suggest noninvasive stress testing.\"\n\n2. What sort of workup/eval would you do? What questions would be important from a risk stratification standpoint?\n\n3. Can you actually stress test patients with large AAAs? Literature shows 6-7cm seems to be safe, but not much data on anything above 7cm. Or would you go straight to angio if concerned?\n\n4. Other thoughts/things to know?\n\nThanks ya'll!",

This, and the general take-home of most available evidence, does not really support ischemia evaluation prior to these surgeries.  \n\nI would only consider an ischemia workup if it were going to make me consider coronary revascularization prior to AAA repair.  In a patient with a large AAA, this is  approximately never.  The situation that I would do ischemia workup prior to AAA (and consider revascularization) is if there are unstable symptoms (ACS). Otherwise, the risk/benefit doesn’t even come close to being favorable. \n\nIt would be reasonable to get an echocardiogram in patients with poor activity level to help guide peri- and intra-operative hemodynamic management.

I've loved everything about cards, the ability to have meaningful procedures and medicine, the mix of complex and more straightforward patients, and the impactful patient interactions you can have. The only thing I really wonder about is the problem solving in cardiology. \n\nI've really liked the kinds of things where you are given a bunch of info about a patient and its up to you to figure out what is going on and how to treat them. Is there much of that in cardiology? From my extremely limited exposure to the field I haven't seen too much of that aspect which is why I ask. Additionally, what types of problems are cardiologists generally solving? Are they complex and requiring some real thought or are many of them just routine? Thanks so much!",

For the majority of Cardiology clinic patients there is a symptoms that presents and you have 1 of 5 diagnostic test to apply. Cardiologists are experts at applying those tests and more importantly interpreting those results. In a perfect world most of those tests have been already ordered.  There really isn't any great Sherlock Holmes investigations that require great intellect. The great intellect is in learning how to manage those conditions once they've been diagnosed. There are few rare Cardiac conditions that require an enquiring/engaged mind to get to the diagnosis. In general the bread and butter is: chest pain, shortness of breath, arrhythmias, heart failure, and the acute and chronic management of atherosclerosis. I'd say Cardiology is best suited for people who like to fix things (i.e. interventionists, electrophysiology, heart failure) or people who are interested in diagnostic imaging (echocardiograms interpretation, nuclear cardiology imaging, cardiac MRI, and cardiac CT). There are puzzles to solve along the way with all of these patients, tests, and procedures. Best of luck!",

Here is one example waveform and if someone could help me understand what would be the difference between lack of trigger and no augmentation that would be great. I assume early inflation and late inflation are incorrect assumptions based of the position of dicrotic notch? The Arterial wave seems to been unaltered so i would assume there is simply no augmentation occurring? if there is, i'm not sure what would cause this appearance besides lack of trigger possibly from failed to open balloon. \n\nAny explanations are welcomed and appreciated thank you! \n\n*I am NOT looking for abcd answers, I have a key.* Just want to understand because there's no explanations.

Third waveform is pressure inside the balloon (I.e. the mechanism moving helium gas in and out of the balloon to inflate and deflate it). Looking at the top waveform and the bottom waveform, the balloon is inflating on the T-wave and deflating just before the QRS - the timing of deflation seems a bit early but not dramatically; overall the timing is probably fine. The arterial waveform, however, has a normal dicrotic notch with absolutely no augmentation whatsoever. So the balloon is in an artery (it’s transducing arterial pressure), and the gas pressure inside it is rising and falling appropriately, but it’s not having any hemodynamic effect. Based on this, I’d say there’s no augmentation, the balloon failed to unwrap, and blood gases aren’t useful (the balloon is in an artery, you’re going to get an arterial gas from both samples). Balloon malposition is common in that these things tend to migrate up and down the aorta after they’re put in, but that would result in suboptimal augmentation, not complete absence of augmentation.\n\nThe alternate scenario which comes to mind is that the middle tracing is from a separate arterial line, not from the balloon itself. This changes things. The timing and trigger are still fine, and there’s still no augmentation. But if that is a radial arterial line tracing, and we don’t have a tracing from the balloon, there is a possibility that the balloon was placed in a vein rather than an artery, and that’s why there’s no augmentation in the artery. In that case, a blood gas from the IABP would show venous blood and would be useful in diagnosing the problem, and I’d say status alarms are least useful.\n\nCurious to know what the correct answers are.",

CT/MRI are low volume and have poor reimbursement/rvu vs time. TEE isn't much better. Nucs are great in that regard but aren't that high volume. Meanwhile echos are ordered like candy and don't take much time. Doing multiple days of it can really give a boost and probably why places may require level 3.

ASCeXAM is not a focused TTE exam - it’s pretty comprehensive and includes both tte, tee, and general ultrasound physics. Generally you’re given a set of images and asked to make a diagnosis or calculate a value.\n\n2. Going purely by pass rates, which has limitations obviously, about twice as many people fail ASCeXAM than do AdvPTEeXAM (80% pass versus 90% pass, respectively). That’s with people studying pretty hard for ASCeXAM too since it’s known at least on the cardiology side as the most difficult of the board exams we take, and that’s with the advantage of spending quite a bit of time on echo rotations.",

I believe that for general cardiology fellowship, it is important to have a good amount of volume and diversity of pathology as others have mentioned. The other thing to ask is which categories in cardiology have enough volume. Echo, cath, EP? And for cath, are those diagnostic, interventional or structural? For echo, do they get enough stress echos and TEEs? What about nuclear stress tests? During the 3 years of training, the main goal is to have a strong foundation in general cardiology. If you want to sub-specialize into interventional, structural, EP, advanced heart failure etc, then that might be something to consider when you interview. But it is definitely important to ask the program if it is easy or hard to get the numbers for each of the categories I mentioned above. What COCATs level do graduates usually get? For instance, at our program we easily get level 2 for echo and nuclear stress which makes you marketable in the real world if you pass those respective board exams. We don't have the volume to get level 3 echo because we don't have enough structural cases, but we do have a variety like TAVR, MitraClip and Watchmans. We have a lot of cath cases but most fellows are not interested in doing IC or invasive upon graduation - regardless, those who are interested can easily get level 2 numbers.",

My first year I applied to 90+ programs and had 4 interviews. I applied to 12 non-accredited 1 year fellowships that year and interviewed at 4 programs but ended up not being accepted into any of those either. My second year I applied to 120ish programs and had 1 interview. This year I've applied to 135+ programs and am sitting at 0 interviews. I'm currently in my second year as a hospitalist at a large academic center, but the cardiology program here seems to prefer outsiders (aka not hospitalists at the program).\n\nI am wondering if my application is weeded out early and if there is anything I can do to fix it. I am a USDO who graduated residency from an academic/university affiliated program. I know more research would help my application, but I don't think reviewers are even getting to that part of my application. Do you think I am weeded out because of my board scores?\n\nLevel 1 - 561 (that was my only year taking Step 1 as well and that score was 235)\n\nLevel 2 - 536\n\nLevel 3 - My first attempt during intern year I failed. I really struggled that year mentally with adjusting but worked on my mentality and in six months, my Level 3 score went from the 200s (not passing) to 659. I address this issue in my personal statement, but I feel like that one exam \"fail\" immediately removes me from a lot of programs. I wish people would look at the actual scores and think something like \"wow, she experienced this failure and seemed to have learned from it and improved exponentially.\" I would hope that overcoming this failure would show resilience, but my guess is that it's what is hurting me the most regardless of my second score.\n\nIs there anything I can or should do to help programs reconsider reviewing my application? Am I probably correct that this one failure is what has been holding me back?\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated!",

Can I ask what type of non-accredited fellowship you ended up doing? I previously applied to heart failure, hypertension, imaging, vascular, and lipidology fellowships and I’m just curious if there is another type out there that would be cardiology relevant. There is an imaging fellowship where I’m a hospitalist and I’ve applied each year, but they stick with a preference of accepting someone who has already completed general cardiology fellowship. I’ve also really struggled with the fact that it seems to be who you know in the cardiology world. I feel like I have a great rapport with the chief of cardiology where I’m working, but the fellowship PD is someone completely different, and I don’t think those two are on the same wavelength. At my home program in residency, my IM PD admitted that one of my co-residents was chosen over me for a cardiology fellowship spot there because of a family connection (their father previously did the cardiology fellowship there) whereas I have zero family members even in medicine. My home program really was great, but it was just such a bummer of an experience based on something I couldn’t help. Do you think more experience in other realms besides research would be helpful? Honestly, research seems to be the answer to everything, but I struggle to figure out how to make that first step in starting a project or finding a mentor. I’m our hospitalist representative for a particular team run by our cardiology department, but I just became the representative this summer so it seems too soon to tell if that will have any benefit. I am content where I’m at as a hospitalist, but I feel like I’m grieving the career I had always longed for at this point.

For reference, I applied during PGY-3 from a mid tier university affiliated program that has University in its name and has dozens of fellowships. I applied to around 120, and got 3 interviews (1 through connection). I applied to two new programs after not matching and also did not receive a match offer from either of those places. It was a really dark time for me especially since literally everyone else matched into something (two colleagues matched internally to the cards program so you can imagine how that felt). I went to see a therapist for a few months and I am sure I had mild depression. It took awhile but I was able to get out of that rut. I found an external PGY-4 Chief position and a currently doing that.i applied to 199 programs this year and to be genuine surprise have 9 interviews. My board scores: USMLE Step 1 243, Step 2 237, no Step 3 (COMLEXs all 500s). I have wha to consider a decent # of publications that tilt mostly towards abstracts.\n\nWith that out of the way, I think a combination of things may be at play. Which one is the primary barrier I do not know. Anecdotally, folks who who seem to be 2+ years out of residency are having a harder time getting interviews. I certainly think the Level 3 failure does not help 😕. The way it was phrased to me is that PDs are finding any reason not to interview candidates and board feeling is low hanging fruit. I think being a DO also hurts us in general and especially can be exacerbated depending on one’s residency program institution. A DO from Mayo Clinic versus, say, a program that has a loose affiliation to some large academic institution will not be viewed equally.\n\nI think you would need to leave the hospitalist job and really commit to cardiology in terms of some kind of 1 year fellowship that likely will extend to 2-3 years of working at said institution in order to backdoor into a program. Part of why I say this also is I see USMDs struggling to get a good # of interviews. I recently was on an interview with a candidate who is an imaging fellow and she is a USMD from a decent program. I was shocked to see that.\n\nI am not sure what advice to give, but I just wanted to say I am right there with you. Feel free to DM if you want to vent or anything. I can share more details if you think that would help contextualize how you are doing.\n\nEdit: I think more research is not the answer unless you literally have &lt;5 research items. More than anything, you need to find a mentor who can vouch for you and aggressively advocate on your behalf. Those things don’t happen overnight as you surely appreciate so it may take some more time.",

All of the criteria above have one thing in common: you do not need to be familiar with the applicant in any real way to adjudicate which pile to put their application in. At my institution, at least one person reads every application in its entirety, but the above scheme tends to play out anyway. \n\nOnly after your application survives the above process will you truly be considered as an applicant with any real effort.  \n\nSo…if your application has a tendency to land in the wrong pile, you have to work on the three things listed above to have a real chance.  \n\n1. You can be a CMR, but keep in mind that some programs want to see you as a 4th year CMR at your own (academic) program.  For some programs an external spot will help.  It’s difficult to do this if you are currently no longer a resident.\n\n2. You can’t change where you trained for residency.  However, you could do a QI or unaccredited cardiology fellowship (imaging, etc.) at a prestigious place and claim a little clout. For most people, this is low yield.\n\n3. Become known to the program. You can do this by working with an influential cardiologist who would recommend you or taking a position (as a researcher, etc.) at a program you want to target.  Typically would be a 2 year commitment.  \n\nAs you can imagine, none of these are sure-things and it is by no means clear if they are worthwhile,or not.  Only you can decide. \n\nIt is NOT worth beefing up your resume with a lot more research (or similar) unless that part of your resume is glaringly anemic or unless you can use those experiences to become known to the programs you are targeting. You need to get past the application filter before that even matters. \n\nBest wishes for matching and for figuring this it out in general.  \n\nAlso, don’t limit yourself to just cardiology.  As a cardiologist, l like what I do. However, it is nonsense when anyone says “this is the only thing I could do” or “this is the only way I could be fulfilled/happy”.  There are all kinds of corners of medicine and ways to use your skill set.  You can find fulfillment, even outside of cardiology.",

                "body": "Hi there! Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to share your insights.  I didn't realize that being a reapplicant could be a limiting factor (I could understand why, though).  Even if the typical filter process tends to happen at your institution, I think that is so genuine that you still try to have at least one person read an applicant's application.  You won't know what you're missing if applicants are weeded out from the beginning.  \n\n  \n1. Agree, it is unlikely I would find any value in doing a chief year at this point.  Somewhat along the same lines, I could further my education (my current position pays for us to get most graduate degrees), so I could add to my CV with an MPH, masters in translational research, etc but I think I would still be weeded out before that part is even realized on my application.\n\n2. I interviewed for several non-accredited fellowships after I didn't match my first time applying and was so hopeful for one of those and am not sure what went wrong.  Perhaps I didn't do anything wrong; there were probably just so many excellent candidates and I happened to not be chosen.  I think it could be at least worth looking into.  At my current hospitalist position, they have a 1 year fellowship, but they essentially always require completion of a general cardiology fellowship first.  I don't think it would hurt to apply to other non-accredited fellowships, though.  It may be low yield but it's not like I would have anything to lose.\n\n3. I think this is my best bet - to try to really connect with someone at my preferred program.  I really thought I was starting to get connected to the chief of the cardiology department where I am a hospitalist, but I don't think he has much pull with the fellowship program at my institution.  During my first year applying, one of my IM attendings new a cardiology PD at another program and reached out to him on my behalf.  I did end up getting an interview at that program but obviously didn't match there.  I had been wondering if it would be worthwhile to ask that attending if he could reach out to the PD again for me; maybe not necessarily for another interview (if they didn't take me the first time, why would they consider me again?), but maybe he could provide some honest, firsthand feedback as to why I wasn't ranked to match at that program when I did interview with them.\n\nI am glad to hear you say that research may not always be the answer.  To be honest, research is not where my heart lies.  My passion has always been the rapport I establish with patients and not necessarily the bookwork behind the scenes.  I am willing to do research though and I think I could get a few projects started where I am a hospitalist (mostly to get those connections, not necessarily to have them on my CV).  I might have higher yield connecting with cardiologists at other programs that would be more willing to take me on as a fellow, but it would be a difficult leap to make to move again and start fresh at a new place on the off chance that it may help me with fellowship.\n\nI really do appreciate your sentiments.  There are many people who want to go into cardiology, and it will always be an in-demand field, so it is unfortunate that fellowships have such a limited capacity and that there aren't more fellowship programs out there.  \n\nIt's funny you say that about not limiting myself.  I have limited myself in the past and have regretted it.  I have been working with 4th year medical students recently and telling them to shoot for their dream programs even if they are unsure about their qualifications matching up to those programs (residency applications were due this week).  I scored midrange on my MCAT and for financial reasons at the time, I couldn't apply to both DO and MD programs, so I chose the former as I felt that I had a higher likelihood of being accepted at a DO program.  If I could do it all over again, I would consider applying to MD programs as well because that would probably have helped my application.  I recognize, though, that if I had gone to an MD school, I doubt I would have had the life experiences that I have enjoyed and met the same amazing people along the way who I now consider some of my best friends.  I actually am really happy as a hospitalist, but I just see myself doing \"more\" if that makes sense.  I want to expand my career and add depth to it.  I have been working with my division chiefs on a committee that explores all the various avenues you can take in medicine that you don't really hear about in med school/residency.  It is actually quite fascinating.",

            "body": "Hi - I am always open to input even as a fellow applicant.  I err on the team side of things and want others to succeed with their fellowship pursuits even if we may be \"competing\" against one another.  I think in your case it's likely that your chief year really helped!  I interviewed for a chief position my third year and they offered me the position, but my heart just wasn't in it.  I didn't know at the time that I would enjoy working with students/residents as much as I do now and it was a very small program without a cardiology fellowship so I am unsure where that would have gotten me.  I do not regret it, though, because I have met some incredible new friends as a hospitalist and genuinely am enjoying my time.  \n\nThat is a really fair point that it is probably multifactorial.  I would hope most programs would see DOs as desirable (we actually had more training that MDs), but I know there is still some hesitancy with accepting DOs.  It is really exciting to hear that your perseverance is paying off.  I'm glad that you seem to have options now with all of your interviews and truly hope you match.  It takes a caring individual to bother to type all of what you said out, so I am sure you are equally as caring and dedicated to your patients.  \n\nAgreed, I should put mentorship more in the foreground.  I had a great cardiology mentor in residency and did a specialized rotation with him, but he was in such a niche field that I don't think it benefited my cardiology pursuits.  In residency, I had been focused on going into ACHD, which I still very much have an interest in but after being a hospitalist, I really enjoy the inpatient setting too, and I am not sure how much inpatient experience I would have in ACHD.  The two letters of rec I have besides the one from my PD were both from pediatric cardiologists who likely expressed my interest in ACHD, so I am not sure if that makes general programs disinterested in interviewing me or not.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need to vent as well!",

        "body": "Not every institution is the same, and I agree with the IC above. Every program will have a set of filters to thin out some of the 700+ applicants. I don't know what the filtersmy program uses, but I know my program uses board failure as one of those criteria, sorry to say. There are still literally 500+ applicants after that filter is applied, all for 2-6 spots depending on the program. Although you had a tough time and subsequently came back with greater fortitude, programs don't know and won't know that if you get filtered out. All they see is another 500 applicants who didn't have the failure.  To bypass the filter, you could send an email to every single program you applied to and let them know your situation, and ask them to review your application. If the program reads the email and feels compelled enough by your story, then you may get lucky and get reviewed.\n\nHalf of the applications may reach the PD/faculty to be reviewed. I reviewed about 200 applicants and I know the program coordinator read all that were not filtered out. Re-applicants is not a huge detractor unless the application is the same, or we interviewed an applicant prior and we didn't like them. There are people who will have beefed up their application from year to year and they are now different people. \n\nUnfortunately, cardiology and desired subspecialties can be more about connections. I know the PD gets a bunch of phone calls and emails about applicants to review. That would be another way to get past the filter if someone calls on your behalf. Even if you had a co-resident who is currently in a fellowship program, they can ask the PD to review your application; that may get you past the filter as well.\n\nIf you are get past the filter, I feel a majority of LORS, research are the same. Experiences and personal statement are big things that will get you the interview or get placed in the backup list, followed by interesting hobbies that resonate with the faculty. Make sure you have everyone you can, read that statement and get feedback to see if the statement really reflects who you really are. \n\nFinally, if you don't match, you can try to find newly accredited programs who are taking their first year class out of the match. That's how I was able to get a spot after I didn't match with 13 interviews, because there will be less applicants you have to compete against. \n\nGood luck with the process.",

It feels like most PDs/PCs probably get emails from a lot of applicants so I'm sure the majority of those emails go unread and are futile (unless you feel otherwise).  My residency program was pretty small and the only connections I would have with peers ended up being fellows at my home residency institution, who again seemed to only keep people who were already established at the hospital / in the region (family connections, etc). \n\n If nothing works out this year, I will see who else I can have review my personal statement/applications.  Hopefully, if I can establish a reliable mentor, then maybe he/she could even help from that standpoint.  \n\nI did see that a few fellowships opened up after the interview season started so I am hoping they did not receive many applications and will be more open to reviewing mine.  Do you think it would be worthwhile to reach out to those programs?  Would I maybe have a better shot with one of them?  I did interview with a program outside of the match in the spring of this year.  They were the only program I emailed after applying since they are going through the match this cycle, but I also never heard back from them.  \n\nAs an aside, it would be helpful if there was some way applicants (of all specialties) could receive feedback on how to improve for the next time they apply if they didn't match in their preferred field when they applied.  I wonder if there would be a way to do that but I'd bet some people would almost find this more frustrating and might take comments too personal.",

Here’s a light-hearted roast:\n\n- **The “I Watched a YouTube Video” Experts**: You’ve got users diagnosing complex heart conditions based on their latest binge-watch of medical drama or a 10-minute YouTube video. “Oh, you have palpitations? Must be ventricular tachycardia. Here, take this aspirin and call me in the morning.”\n\n- **The Statin Wars**: Every thread about cholesterol turns into a battlefield. “Statins are the devil!” vs. “Statins are the elixir of life!” Meanwhile, actual cardiologists are probably facepalming so hard they’re in danger of giving themselves concussions.\n\n- **The ECG Wizards**: There’s always that one guy who posts an ECG and asks, “What’s this?” hoping someone will confirm their self-diagnosis of “a rare, yet to be named, heart condition.” Spoiler: It’s usually just sinus rhythm.\n\n- **The “My Doctor is Wrong” Brigade**: These folks come armed with Google Scholar articles, ready to tell their cardiologist why they’re mistaken. “Dr. Google says I should be on this obscure medication that’s only been tested on lab rats in Siberia!”\n\n- **The Anecdote Enthusiasts**: “My uncle’s friend’s dog had a similar issue, and they cured it with turmeric and positive vibes.” Because if it worked for a canine, it must be universally applicable to human hearts, right?\n\n- **The “I’m More Cardio Than You” Competitions**: Where users try to outdo each other with how much they know about cardiology. “I bet you didn’t know about the obscure case of the 1922 heart murmur in a goldfish!”\n\n- **The Overly Dramatic**: “I felt a slight flutter in my chest while eating a sandwich. Is it time to write my will?” Meanwhile, their heart is probably just like, “Dude, it’s just digesting your lunch.”\n\n- **The “I’m Going to Medical School Next Week” Crowd**: They’ve already got their white coat picked out and are giving out medical advice like they’ve been in practice for years. “Just do what I say, I’ll be a doctor soon!”\n\nIn essence, r/cardiology on Reddit is a delightful mix of genuine curiosity, misplaced confidence, and enough medical advice to make Hippocrates roll over in his grave. But hey, it’s all in good fun, and who knows, maybe the next breakthrough in cardiology will come from someone who started with, “I read on Reddit...”",

In terms of hours and calls?  \n2) How many weeks of vacation do you get? Are you happy with it?  \n3) Do you feel overworked or burned out?

If malignant means that you do few cases and mostly scut work…that should be a hard no.  If they are dragging one year of cases out over two years…that’s a no too.  \n\nUnlike all earlier phases of training, 99% of IC year is just about seeing and doing lots and lots of cases.  You don’t want to skimp on that.  Remember that other proceduralists (surgeons) have 4-8 years to more-or-less only develop procedural skills. You only have 1-2 years. \n\nAside from getting enough procedures, everything else is “extras” that depend on your interests and goals.  Is it a 1 or 2 year program?  Are there options to be qualified to do structural and/or peripheral (if you are interested in those)?  Is it an academic program (mostly only matters if you wish to stay academic)?

Unless you are going to a well-established program with long-standing reputation for being excellent or not so excellent, everything in the middle of that spectrum can vary greatly and unpredictably. Staff leave at the drop of a hat, turn over in many places is high, systems are currently merging and transforming, volumes can fluctuate. Worst of all, people lie either intentionally or not - what you may be promised during your interview may be night and day compared to your actual experience as an IC fellow.\n\nWhat served me well was looking for a place that seems to have decent, solid people, that are willing to teach. Equally important is procedural volume, the kinds of procedures that are done, and your role in the lab. Things that were red flags were attendings that were dismissive during interviews or just plain disinterested, miserable IC fellows, or word of mouth about fellows struggling to get case loads or being overworked.\n\nOther things to look out for is call burden, support from and quality of the general fellowship, burden of presentations/research/admin tasks, number of IC fellows, where IC fellows end up afterwards, livability of the city you are in, interactions between the IC attendings, culture of the program, etc.\n\nYour best bet is finding fellows at the programs which you are interested in and asking them directly what their experience is/was like.

Even a fib would be rare to go that fast in a 91 year old because of the difficulty in the AVN to transmit that fast. For the sake of documenting the rapid response it would be very reasonable to just say it was a narrow complex tachycardia and treat with AVN blockers. Recommend ambulatory monitor at discharge.",

Is it safe to stress test a patient who comes in to the ED who is deemed \"intermediate risk\" with a positive troponin?\n\nI've looked through the chest pain guidelines and they are being, as best I can tell, contradictory and/or vague. Intermediate-risk pts are those \"without high risk features and not classified as low risk\" based on a clinical decision pathway (Heart score, timi score, etc). It goes on to say, \"Intermediate risk patients **do not have evidence of acute myocardial injury by troponin**.\" Then in the very next sentence, \"Some may have chronic or minor troponin elevations.\" What constitutes a minor troponin? &lt;1?\n\nThe next section describes high-risk pts as those \"with symptoms suggestive of ACS who are at high risk of short-term MACE and include those with new ischemic changes on the ECG, **troponin-confirmed acute myocardial injury**...\"\n\nLet's say an ESRD patient comes in with chest pain after dialysis that doesn't sound typical for angina (onset at rest, constant for several hours, resolved with morphine once arrived at the ED), no ischemic EKG changes but then their troponin rises to 0.1 initially then 0.3 after 12 hrs. That seems like a relatively minor elevation (especially in the context of ESRD on dialysis), but I don't have another explanation for the troponin rise...wouldn't that make them an NSTEMI? And wouldn't stress testing them be an incredibly bad idea? But by Heart score they are \"intermediate risk\".",

The guidelines and scores help, but it takes experience (which you will have plenty of very soon). \n\nThe story that you gave (ESRD, etc.) doesn’t really sound like ACS to me.  It sounds more like stable CAD and supply-demand mismatch with dialysis.  Troponin may be up due to that and ESRD. There are different definitions of MI, but [the fourth universal definition](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2018/08/24/00/09/Fourth-Universal-Definition-of-MI-ESC-2018) is the most common.  Bottom line is that you need more than a troponin elevation. \n\nIf you are still concerned about ACS, pharm myocardial perfusion imaging (not sure what you meant by “stress test”) might be a good idea because it can show new perfusion deficits and “rule in” MI.

However, when it comes to reading ECGs, I’m still a bit uncertain. I understand most of it, but I struggle with interpreting the QRS complex and ST segment.\n\nDuring the QRS complex, the ventricles depolarize. Specifically, during the Q wave, the electrical impulse reaches the bottom middle of the heart and then spreads to both the left and right ventricles. During the R wave, the ventricular walls or \"sides\" depolarize. During the S wave, the rest of the ventricles, the bottoms, depolarize.\n\nNow here is my question, which I haven't been able to figure out yet: Does the contraction of the ventricles start during the R wave or during the ST segment? From what I have learned, during the QRS complex, the ventricles only depolarize, and at the start of the S wave, they begin contracting until the T wave arrives, by which time they are fully contracted, have pumped all the blood out, and then start repolarizing. \n\nHowever, when I asked ChatGPT about this, it suggested that the ventricles start contracting at the start of the Q wave and finish contracting at the end of the T wave, instantly starting repolarization as if the contraction follows the depolarization.\n\nWhich explanation is correct?",

    "selftext": "\nOne of the compensatory responses to heart failure (and the accompanying reduction in cardiac output) is for the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to activate. While this has myriad effects, one that is described in most cardiac pathophysiology textbooks (eg, Lilly) is that the activation of the SNS causes peripheral vasoconstriction, raising the systemic vascular resistance (SVR).\n\nHowever, I don't understand why the body would do this. The underlying problem in HF is a reduction in cardiac output (either due to diastolic or systolic failure). Raising SVR (using the cardiac equivalent of Ohm's Law: Pressure = CO x SVR) would either a) cause cardiac output to drop, holding pressure constant or b) force the heart to generate more pressure to generate to maintain a constant CO. Both seem like poor responses to a failing heart. So why does the body do this?\n\nPut otherwise, if I had independent control over every hemodynamic parameter in the body and I was confronted by a failing heart, my solution would be to increase HR and contractility (which the SNS does), but to vasodilate the systemic arterioles to lower resistance and thus (by Ohm;s Law once again) reduce the pressure the heart would need to generate in order to drive the same amount of flow as prior to the heart failure. Why is this a bad idea?\n\nI think there are some preliminary questions that might help clear up my confusion. They are probably very basic, but I think they will help clear up the confusion I face.\n\nA. Why is blood pressure (specifically mean arterial pressure, measured at the aorta) important to maintain? The goal of the heart is to maintain tissue perfusion, which seems to me to be function of the volume of blood which gets to a certain organ?\n\nB. Does the body regulate blood pressure or cardiac output? If both, which takes priority?",

        "body": "A.  Maintenance of tissue perfusion, not blood pressure, is the ultimate imperative.  That means maintaining Q (flow, or volume of blood per time).  Going back to Ohm’s law, you get Q = ΔP / R.  Raising aortic pressure increases ΔP and, therefore increases Q, or volume delivered per time.  Dropping R can also increase Q, but you can only do that so much (there is a minimum intrinsic SVR and some organs—kidneys—require a certain pressure to function).  That means that aortic pressure becomes a key driver of Q.\n\nIn a healthy heart, there is cardiac reserve: contractility, stroke volume and heart rate can all increase, resulting in a higher cardiac output.  This means that all three components of Ohm’s law can change dynamically through a number of homeostatic feedback loops.  For instance, an increase in SVR may cause an increase in ΔP but also trigger increased Q through more contractility and stroke volume. The mechanisms result in some sort of equilibrium to perfuse tissue appropriately.\n\nThe key term above is “healthy”.  In heart failure, the key problem is that cardiac output, Q, cannot be increased because there is no cardiac reserve.  Q becomes a constant. That means that changes in ΔP are directly offset by changes in R with no net benefit.  The homeostatic feedback loops that are well-tuned and work so well with a healthy heart are not effective.  Worse, they cause harm by increasing pressure and wearing out the failing heart faster.  This is a key problem in heart failure.\n\n\n\n2. I think it is inappropriate to think of “the body” regulating and prioritizing things as if a centralized decision maker were engineering every physiologic change.  We have all kinds of feedback mechanisms that interact and change all three components of Ohm’s law constantly. These mechanisms are what maintains homeostasis. \n\nWhen a major part of the system (the ability to increase cardiac output) fails, these feedback systems do not work as intended.  That’s why heart failure patients need doctors.  We become the decision makers and we use drugs to override, reengineer and re-tune all those feedback mechanisms in order to prioritize changes that we, with our rational brains, know can help.  This is pretty much what all HF drugs are for.",

All three variables can change (in a healthy individual with plenty of reserve).\n\nHeart failure, at its root, is loss of cardiac reserve.

I was invited to interview for a PGY-4 Chief Resident position at another program in my home state (in house fellowships) that I ultimately accepted.

Last year I thought my one faulty LOR was the issue, I upgraded and revamped my LORs but not getting the traction I’d have hoped.\n\nI was considering my last option is be a hospitalist at either this program and spend 1-3 years getting to know the program and suicide match or other option is find another 1 year fellowship but run the risk of failing to match for a third time and waste 2 years in total not making an attending salary.

I assume that your LORs are fine. \n\nHonestly, you seem like you will be an excellent fellow and cardiologist, so I hope you match.  Sometimes the sorting factors that fellowships use just don’t work well for certain applicants.  \n\nThere are a few things on your application that are going to create challenges for matching into many programs.  These are:\n- The anti-DO prejudice.  Lame, I know, but at some programs it’s real. \n- Reapplication is always a negative unless there is a good explanation. \n- Residency was not at an academic (or similar…I assume) program.\n\nTaken as a whole, these factors are not “bad”.  They just won’t make your application stand out and, unfortunately, they are the sorts of things that are easy for programs to use in first-round assessment of applications to thin the list.  The bottom line here is that you are not likely to be DQed from most programs, but you also are not likely to be automatically granted an interview at most programs.  You are going to have to work extra hard to stand out.\n\nIf you don’t match and still want cards, here are some thoughts:\n- Pay close attention to out-of-match vacancies that open up.  Things happen; people decide not to do fellowship, quit or are fired.  The couple of times that I have participated in filling these spots, we have struggled to find qualified (let alone exciting) last minute applicants.  There is opportunity if keep an ear to the ground.\n- Get in with the cardiologists at your current institution.  You are a chief there.  They should be interested in you.  If you have not already, you should meet with the cardiology PD and all key cardiology faculty that you can.  Ask for advice and help with your career.  Your IM PD may even help facilitate this.  This is a benefit of being a CMR.  They may give you a spot or help you match elsewhere.\n- Consider spending time as an “away rotation” at a target program.  I am not 100% sure how this would work as a chief, but look into it.  Fellowship programs are risk-averse and prefer taking someone they know.  If you do this, don’t go to an ultra-competitive program.  It won’t move the needle enough at a place like that.  Find a strong community cardiology program that has accepted DOs in the past and pursue them.\n- Ask your current IM PD if former CMRs have gone into cardiology.  Get the details of how they did it and reach out to them for specific advice if possible. \n\nDon’t worry too much about where you match.  There are very few bad cardiology fellowship programs.  If you want more prestige when you are done, you can always do sub-specialty fellowship somewhere fancy. \n\nGood luck.",

To be honest though, even 1st or 2nd year cardiology fellows don't get as much out of the lab, esp in EP studies and ablations, it's very boring if you don't know what's going on. The best way I can explain is like watching the Matrix movie through only those green text scrolls, it doesn't make any sense, but once you start to understand signals, EGMs etc and can \"enter the Matrix\" so to speak, it becomes a eureka moment and the procedures become \"cool\". I think it would also be beneficial for you to see implants of newer devices like leadless dual chamber pacemakers or extravascular ICDs. Personally though, the complex ablations are what really got me into EP.

A vey small percentage of hospitals (even top ones) utilize “cardiology critical care” specialists.  The programs that have this model will love your interest in it.  The remaining (overwhelming majority of) places will range from not understanding it to being skeptical or outright hostile towards the whole concept.  Practically speaking, it will be easier to match if your interest is in EP, HF, imaging, IC, ACHD or general cardiology with a specific unique interest.  Again, you are very likely to change your mind again once in fellowship anyway (as I and many others did).",

Depolarization/repolarization is really only referring to the area directly inside the membrane, and the total concentration of ICF Na+ ions only changes by a fraction of a percent during these events. \n\nHow are we able to record de/repolarization on something like an EKG? On a large scale, wouldn’t the shift in polarity within the ICF be cancelled out by an equal and opposite shift in the ECF?",

I am thinking to suck it up with back pain with NSAIDs, heating pads, lumbar support and do it then down-scale to general if I realize I can't do it anymore. I feel like most ICs are not taking on high-risk cases anyway, I can be happy with LHCs and ACS/PCIs here and there. Not thinking structural or peripheral work due to duration of those procedures.  \n  \nOn the other hand, I feel like it is a bad way to start a new career this way, and I am worried that this would impact my health and also worried that I can't be good at it if I continuously avoid longer procedures. 'd also ideally would like to work in a tertiary care center, it seems like most of those places require coronary + a skill set per my research which would limit me further. I would be decently happy with non-invasive cardiology if it comes to that - I just really enjoy procedures and having rough time giving it up.

    "selftext": "I often struggle with episodes of accelerated sinus rhythm. For example, when I lift something or do even mild physical activity, my heart rate can suddenly jump to around 150+ bpm. I immediately get warm and start sweating, even though the effort is minimal.\nI also sometimes get these episodes out of nowhere. My heart rate then stays elevated for a while, sometimes around 100 bpm, sometimes 130–150 bpm even when I’m just resting. I also run regularly and try to maintain an easy, steady pace, but my heart rate often climbs higher anyway, even though the effort feels light. Afterward, it can stay high for a long time, even if I’m not out of breath at all.\n\nI’ve had multiple tests done by a cardiologist (Holter, stress test, echocardiogram). They concluded that I have SVT and elevated sinus rhythm. I tried verapamil but stopped because of side effects.\nMy cardiologist mentioned catheter ablation as an option, but I barely suffer from SVT since it’s only occasional. My main problem is these frequent episodes of (presumably) elevated sinus rhythm, and medications tend to give me side effects.\n\nAre there other options I should consider, or what would be the smartest next step in this situation?",

    "selftext": "Hi. Recently, I have had squeezing pains in the chest and jugular area, as well as sudden confusion spells that last for only a few seconds. The squeezing and rapid onset of confusion happens after exertion. 33 male. \n\nWent to er. Told it was chest pain unspecified, no catscan. Troponin was minimal\n They checked  it twice. Thrombocytosis, they noticed as well. \n\n\nPrimary and my endocrinologist say anxiety. \n\nEndo did say platelet count is high at 530.\n\nA Hemotologist at a hospital for platelet count of 530 says blood clot and needs catscan for the sudden onset of confusion, squeezing at heart area and jugular area.\n\nHe said I needed to go to ER, but the thing is, no one escorted me to the er. He wanted me to walk over on my own, unsupervised. If they let me walk over on my own, it must not be an emergency. I saw him at a hospital, which is a few minutes' walk to er. Why would he let me go on my own with symptoms such as trouble walking, sudden confusion spells, jugular area squeezing, and chest pain. \n\nAlso wants an abdominal ultrasound ? \n\nPrimary care prescribed beta blockers for anxiety. Only 10 day supply. I heard it's dangerous to suddenly have to stop them. Bottle says 10mg 3x day. 10 day supply. \n\nI also asked my primary if he could order a catscan outside the er, as it would be way cheaper, but I dont think he'll do it. He doesn't see a need for me to go to er, and I know he won't want me to do a catscan. \n\nIm afraid to go to er. They'll likely just say it's anxiety, too. I'll be on the hook for thousands just for people to say \"it's anxiety.\"\n\nEndo says say 530 platelet count is high, er doc primary and hemotologist says it's not. Then why did they put thrombocytosis on discharge papers for er. \n\nI can't stand this anymore. \n\nEdit: I wanted to add, my upstairs neighbors would terrorize me and my nervous system by jumping up and down on the floor as a form of harassment for calling the police on them for loud music 130am on a Monday night. They proceeded to stomp the floor so hard they would put cracks in the ceiling. They would stomp at random very frequently for months on end. It really terrorized my nervous system. I've already seen psychiatrists and therapists. My psych says I have hypervigilance. \n\nEdit 2: I have watched people die countless times, also making my heart rate climb. Seeing so many family members lying dead on a hospital bed. I never felt the same, and Im talking physically, seeing my mom passed away on a hospital bed. Already on meds and psych and therapy. They dont treat physical things. \n\nIs this dysautomia?/pots ? My heart rate gets high doing the simplest things. Im very active and ride a bike alot too, but stopped because of scary symptoms listed at top.  I think my heart got too used to beating so much it's like stuck if you will. \n\n",

Beyond that, the actual adhesive (not the surrounding, but the strip on the device that goes down) is not just itchy but stinging. \nMy question is this… what are my options? It’s obviously the weekend now, so I doubt my cardiologist will get back to me until Monday. I really need these results, but I’ve had multiple symptoms recorded in the 2 days already. I’ve also seen placement horizontal on the upper chest, and I’m not sure why that wasn’t an option for me. I’ve done a holter monitor before and it was the lanyard/electrode kind with no issue. \nI welcome any input, including “suck it up for two weeks.” Thank you!",

Sometimes its associated with some pressure or some pain in the surrounding area. I saw a cardiologist and he ordered an ultrasound and CT of my head/neck and chest which isn't scheduled until next week because they needed to do a prior authorization first. He said that he had only ever seen this (horizontal) once before and he was concerned for possible SVC syndrome or muscle compression of SVC.\n\nToday I feel a little lump under my left posterior jaw maybe 1-2cm in size. I am concerned it could be either a swollen lymph node or a blood clot. No fever or cough. My tests are next week and follow up is early December. Can this really wait this long? What are some signs I should be concerned about or thoughts in general about what could cause this? Thanks!",

The pain  faded away and came back multiple times without any apparent reason even if I was resting and not engaged in activity but not severe enough that it caused me to take rest whenever I was engaged in activity over the past 4 months.\n\nAnd now from the past week I am having back pain which feels like some stretching of my skin on the surface and cant sleep comfortably on my back I have to sleep on either the left or right side. I am also having headache all over my head which feels like something is wrapped around my head and pain in my neck like under jawline whenever I turn my head left but its normal to turn right and there was the occasional chest pain as always. I took a BP reading last night and it was 155/94 (123hr) left arm 153/85 (113hr) right arm and after relaxing a bit and taking few deep breathes it was 140/85 (117hr)  I was wondering if this is caused due to some serious condition like aortic dissection or aneurysm or other cardio conditions and need advice on next steps.

    "selftext": "I recently got diagnosed with SVT, unsure what exact type, after wearing a Zio patch for a few weeks. I feel as though it's gotten worse since the diagnosis, though I've been assured that I'm not at high risk for anything dangerous. I have a few hundred episodes a day, usually only lasting 10 to 30 seconds. The problem is that I can't get prescribed beta blockers because my resting heart rate is already pretty low – 35-45 bpm, I'm relatively active. I've noticed on my 'bad' days with high episode frequency, I get anxious which triggers more episodes, more anxiety, etc. I've fainted during an episode once, though I'm fairly confident this was a vasovagal response and not a sinus one since I felt onset of syncope symptoms and was able to avoid getting hurt. Is cardiac ablation my only option? Could this resolve on its own? The episodes have lasted a few months now, but it was so weird that it came out of nowhere. \n\nA little more context, I regularly see a cardiologist since I have a congenital heart defect (TGV, corrected at birth), but I've been told this issue is unrelated since I was totally healthy otherwise. Right before the SVT episodes started I had an echocardiogram, CT scan, MRI, and bloodwork done and everything was totally fine.",

When adjusting the dose based on INR (aiming for 2–3 for example ), do we calculate the change as a percentage?\n\n\n2. Should adjustments be based on the weekly dose or the daily dose?\n\n\n3. How often should we check INR after changing the dose?\n\n\n4. When and how should we alternate different doses across the week ( exemple : 3/4 tablet for a day and 1/4 tablet the day after )?\n\n\n\nAny practical advice, resources, or protocols would be really helpful.

Background- 30 year old female- healthy BMI, non-smoker, I don't exercise but am moderately active, mostly healthy diet, low caffeine, rarely drink alcohol, no history of hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea or anything else. Large bilateral PE 5 years ago with residual bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis (partially collapsed lungs)\n\nI had an Echocardiogram done recently after having a multitude of symptoms for the last two years. This echo was read and signed off on by another cardiologist at the office, as my Dr was on leave at the time. It showed grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and moderatley elevated filling pressures, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary regurgitation, and aortic sclerosis. At my follow up appointment, a different Dr said everything looks fine and nothing to worry about. I mentioned the above issues that were present on the report, and he said he'll review them again but since I'm \"young and female\" there's likely no real issues and it was probably read wrong. He was gone 5 minutes, came back and said everything on the report was incorrect and my heart is as healthy as any 15-20 year olds, diagnosed me with POTS on the spot. He did order a stress test, and pushed a beta blocker even though my resting heart rate is in the 40s during the day sometimes. \n\nPreviously I had an EKG done which showed a possible right ventricular conduction delay and a first degree AV block. Holter results were mostly normal but I have a wide heart rate range (38-197bpm) brief episodes of NSVT, some bigeminy, trigemimy and couplets. I do have a lot of symptoms that align with POTS, but diastolic dysfunction can mimic POTS. I've been having some symptoms that POTS can't explain. \n\nPOTS would certainly be a better diagnosis, but this situation feels bizarre. I do plan to seek a second opinion after the stress test, but I don't really know how how to go about that at this time. ",

    "selftext": "This is quite a long post. I'm just trying to figure out what went wrong with my heart, when I have clear arteries, I'm, young, fit and live mostly healthy. I've tried to document everything I can think of, I do have a cardiologist appointment coming up, and knowing what to ask would be very helpful. I'm really hoping to get to figure out what the cause was so I can prevent it from happening again. I've included all my ECGs and my MRI at the bottom. Thanks to all:\n\n**Age**: 46\n\n**Gender**: Male\n\n**Height**: 1.74m\n\n**Weight**: 69kg\n\n**BMI**: 22.8\n\n**BSA**: 1.83\n\n**Family heart history**: My father had a heart valve replaced when he was 70. He was hugely overweight (120kg increasing to 165kg before the heart valve replacement at 1.8m tall) and diabetic after years of eating and drinking alcohol excessively though. No other relatives that I know of have heart issues.\n\n**Other health symptoms**: For the past 3 years I’ve had episodes of extreme vertigo maybe every 2 months. They seem to be triggered by head positions and often on days I feel dehydrated. They resolve quickly, especially when I lie down. I haven’t been able to trigger them myself, and after speaking to a GP they said I should go as soon as I’ve had one to an ENT, but unfortunately I’ve never had one when there was an ENT available. I’ll see an ENT this winter to see if they can figure this out.\n\nStarting around the same timeframe I’ve also had episodes of double vision, again I feel that there’s a dehydration trigger in this, but also that the bright light I’m in all the time could cause some eye strain. These occur also very infrequently and resolve on their own after a minute or so. I do see an ophthalmologist annually, but I’ve forgotten to bring it up in my last 2 visits. I have an appointment again in March where I will bring it up. \n\n**About me:** I’m very active, in winter I typically go to gym around 4-5 times a week focusing on weights and body weight exercises. Cardio is generally walking (10,000 steps normally, up to 20,000) and cycling at low intensity. In summer we live on a sailboat, so my exercise is walking, rowing to shore and back, swimming, stand up paddleboarding and bodyweight exercises at outdoor gyms once or twice a week.\n\nI’ve got an athletic build and have maintained low levels of bodyfat (&lt;10%) for the last 15 years. Before this episode I never took any medication, only a multi-vitamin. This image is from a few days ago, indicating that I'm lean and in shape, weird chest hair thanks to the nurses :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/311vf08fp01g1.jpg?width=1539&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebcd82fc864a7d06b3393b31cfb6881d99b8f766\n\nI have never been a drinker or a smoker, and eat healthily most days, with no sugar or starch in my diet at least 6 days a week, with intermittent fasting on around an 18:6 eating window, typically eating my main meal between 6pm and 9pm in summer, earlier in winter. On off days I would indulge in take out food and sugar, which wouldn’t agree with my system. If I overindulged it would cause me to have a noticeable heartbeat, and a very bloated stomach for the next day or so. Until June this year I’ve never been a coffee drinker, but I started having coffee with my wife in the mornings.\n\nMy blood pressure is usually around the 120/85 level but I have had times when it was higher. The last time it was higher was in February/March 2019 where it peaked around the 140/90 level for around a week if I remember right. It was a particularly busy time at work, and I hadn’t been exercising as much as usual. I resolved it by upping my cardio at the gym, and cutting weight from 73kg to 70kg, and since then it’s been back around the 120/85 range. \n\nThe other times it was high were isolated tests. I’ve also been told I have white coat hypertension, where sudden stress could raise the numbers. The last time this happened was around 2021 when I needed to pass a blood pressure test for my drone pilots licence, where my pressure at home was normal, but at the doctors office was 140/90. I did buy a blood pressure monitor around then, and confirmed it was working correctly and the blood pressure lowered again when I was at home.\n\n**Timeline around the heart episode**\n\n**13/14 October**: I had a stomach bug with diarrhea. It was short-lived but intense. I was walking to a bathroom onshore and got so light headed that I had to sit on the ground where I was for a few minutes, very unusual for me. After going to the bathroom I felt better, and carried on with my day, but taking it easy. After that day I was back to normal.\n\n**24 October**: We went out for pizza and pasta. The chef/owner of the restaurant was ill, and told us that. The seafood pasta also tasted odd, my wife actually stopped eating it after one bite, but she’s quite a fussy eater, and I thought it was reasonable so carried on. We also had an ice cream, and later I had two slabs of chocolate and some popcorn. \n\n**25 October +- 3am**: I woke up choking with some vomit in my mouth. I never vomited, but my body was in full panic from the choke, I remember my heart beating very strongly, and it took me a while to calm down again and get back to sleep.\n\n**26 October**: Seemed like a normal day, we went to shore for coffee, walked the dogs, did some shopping and then in the early afternoon went to move the boat. On the way to the boat I had a double vision episode, which resolved after a minute or two.\n\nI felt fine, but on lifting the anchor (20kg) I felt some mild heartburn. When I got back inside the boat I also noticed that I felt hot, which was unusual for me. My wife said “what if it’s a heart attack” which caused me to panic a little, so I went to get my blood pressure monitor. The first reading was very high, but I kept taking readings every so often and it dropped quickly back to normal, here’s an approximate timeline for the readings:\n\n||\n||\n|**Time**|**Systolic**|**Diastolic**|**Pulse Pressure**|**Pulse**|**Notes**|\n|14:00|150|107|43|72|My wife said maybe it was a heart attack which freaked me out and I'm sure raised my blood pressure|\n|14:03|145|107|38|74|Time is estimated|\n|14:06|139|102|37|76|Time is estimated|\n|14:15|133|96|37|72|Time is estimated|\n|14:45|116|80|36|70|Time is estimated|\n|15:45|118|88|30|67|Time is estimated|\n|16:00|123|93|30|74|Time is estimated, after docking the boat|\n|16:15|116|86|30|63|Time is estimated, after speaking to the neighbour|\n|16:30|119|89|30|68|Just before leaving for the hospital|\n\nI felt fine after docking the boat and pulling the lines tight with normal strength etc. I had a conversation with the neighbour and carried on as normal, but at around 17:00 we decided to walk to Preveza hospital (+-2km) and see how I felt when I got there. I actually felt fine, the heartburn had passed earlier, but decided to get checked out anyway since I was already there.\n\nThey did an ECG which they said was normal and then took some blood (all ECG printouts are right at the bottom). I waited outside for two hours and they came to call me inside for an ECHO and another blood test. After another half an hour they game me a pill to chew, said I’d had a heart attack and was moving to the bigger regional hospital for an angiogram.\n\nIt was a 2 hour drive to Ioannina hospital with another heart attack patient. He had his angiogram first and needed stents so it took quite some time before I could have mine. It was eventually my turn, I had some more medication and went in, and then after a short while I was wheeled out again. The doctors said my arteries were all very clear and so my issue must be something else. I was sent into the ER at around 1am, still feeling fine apart from the sore arm, and hooked up to an ECG and blood oxygen meter. The ECG was normal, and my blood oxygen sat pretty much at 100% all the time, so they removed that after a day or so.\n\nIn the ER on the first morning (27 October) they tested my Troponin again and it was on 9000ng/L. The next morning (28 October) they tested it and it was 13102ng/L so I had to spend another day in ER. They did a range of other tests in the ER and all came back normal:\n\nCreat = 1.03mg/dl Hb = 13.1gr/dl, PLTs=280,00 Trop I max = 13102ng/L, LDL-71mg/dl, CRP 0.21mg/dl. I was also told I had an ejection fraction of 55%.\n\nOn 29 October they tested my Troponin again and it had dropped to 4000ng/L and I was sent to the regular ward. I had a 24 hour Holter monitor there which was normal. On 31 October I was tested again for Troponin and it was on 900ng/L and I was discharged and told to arrange a CMR. \n\n**I went for the MRI on 5 November, these are the notes from the MRI:**\n\nAdmission 26/10/2025-31/10/2025 with chest pain and Trop rise. ICA: no significant coronary artery stenosis.\n\n**FINDINGS**\n\nLeft ventricle: Normal indexed volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. Normal wall thickness (max 9mm at the basal septum) and mass index.\n\nRight ventricle: Normal volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No regional wall motion abnormality. No right ventricular hypertrophy\n\nAtria: Both atria are of normal size (LA 29ml/m2 and RA 39ml/m2). No significant cardiac shunt identified. Qp/Qs\\~1.05\n\nValves: Tricuspid aortic valve. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary valve.\n\nGreat Vessels: Thoracic aorta (ascending aorta 27mm at the RPA level) and pulmonary artery (main PA 21mm) are of normal calibre. Normal aortic arch branching. No aortic coarctation.\n\nSTIR-T2 images: Increased myocardial signal at the basal LV inferolateral wall.\n\nPericardium: Small pericardial effusion (\\~2mm adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall). Increased pericardial signal adjacent to the basal LV inferolateral wall on STIR and LGE imaging.\n\nTissue characterisation: Native myocardial T1 values and T2 values at the basal LV inferolateral wall are increased (\\~1165ms and \\~69ms at 1.5T respectively). Normal ECV value of the whole myocardium (\\~25%) with increased value of the basal LV inferolateral wall \\~47%.\n\nGadolinium study: In the early phase, no LV/RV thrombus is evident. In the late phase, there is almost transmural LGE of the basal LV inferolateral wall.\n\nExtra-cardiac findings: Unremarkable. Please note; formal assessment of extracardiac pathology was not undertaken on this scan. Correlation with other imaging modalities is advised.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\n1. Normal LV volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF 65%). Hypokinesia of the basal LV inferolateral wall. No LVH.\n\n2. Normal RV volumes and ejection fraction (RVEF 58%). No RWMAs. No RVH.\n\n3. Myocardial oedema of the basal LV inferolateral wall.\n\n4. LGE at the basal LV inferolateral wall.\n\n5. Small pericardial effusion with increased localised pericardial signal adjacent to the basal inferolateral LV wall on STIR and LGE images, indicating mild localised pericardial inflammation.\n\nFindings are more suggestive of recent myocardial infarction of the basal inferolateral LV wall with evidence of myocardial oedema.\n\nThe infarct size is likely overestimated due to the presence of oedema.\n\nFollow-up CMR in 3 months is recommended to depict the exact size of the infarct. The remaining LV segments are viable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg31fsyir01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3a4c54fcdfaef0a8fb25fbe197b1bba27bbaac7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbe910sjr01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12659a31aec67bc65be7cc40305bdaaba0dfe1af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohapfkmkr01g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62f343085352623d61fd38952436bba41fd9aa3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7d0m9nit01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea27c067ea4b8d09c83eb6d561bb7bf6a18a2d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmgsjynjt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7507a875aeaa1c939c850ed0817857225f7a153\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4pen9ggkt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00544f27097ac550741f16ea1eecd8ad26e2ffb0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21zfoublt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1946d3be17f1a902c931adae08899c9b335ac6c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hof48b0mt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce3f08ca7933cd5fdbc6eb833a873ab7090987dc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2ci3xlmt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af62f446f7f9f527089e23b13db6d8393869b17\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vrcdv6nt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d241906abe6a66f8a0196ea7c55d04ccb797b9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76lmydtnt01g1.jpg?width=2480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9ee6c37b4921791f7ed3f0d579ba467e514ec7\n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m having a very hard time with the decision of whether my 10 year old daughter should have an ablation for her SVT. \n\nHer first episode was about 5 months ago at a sports competition (lots of anxiety + physical activity). We didn’t know about vagal maneuvers or anything at the time. Long story short, she was in SVT for 3 hours and given 2 doses of adenosine in the ER. She had 2 more episodes within a month of the first. One lasted for 5 minutes and vagal maneuvers worked. Second lasted about 45 minutes and resolved on its own on the way to the ER. She had a normal echo and cardiologist confirmed she does not have the WPW pattern on her EKG. \n\nAfter the repeated episode, I scheduled the ablation, which is next week. Since then, she has had no episodes or symptoms for close to 3 months, despite being very active and in competitive sports. The first hospital visit with adenosine was pretty traumatic and I do not want her to experience it again. However, I’m worried about the risks of the ablation too including possibly causing more rhythm problems or symptoms like PVCs chest pain etc, on top of the scarier risks to think about (which I realize are very rare - but this is my kid  so even a 0.0001% chance still feels scary) \n\nIt’s been a quiet 3 months which makes me wonder if this is the best decision right now, especially at such a young age. I know nobody can make this decision but us but I’m wondering if anyone can share their experiences with childhood SVT and/or thoughts on this? I know SVT won’t just go away but she’s doing so well and I don’t know I should try to “fix something that isn’t broken”. Maybe she would handle it better physically and mentally when she’s a few years older? (Although she has pretty much zero anxiety over the procedure - that’s all me lol) I’m terrified to make the wrong decision either way I go.😭",

BCx were neg, initial CXR unremarkable, TTE just showed mod aortic regurg (chronic, not new). Eventually he developed noncardiogenic pulm edema which they were tx with Lasix (he has h/o CKD so they weren’t too aggressive).

    "selftext": "Hello! Not asking for a diagnosis of course but just a direction I might research further (plus I fully plan to schedule a cardiology appointment soon, as I have a\\[n unrelated\\] surgery planned next year and want to know before then). I've had this happen over my life, not too frequently, and almost always when exercising. I believe two of my siblings have something similar.\n\nSymptoms: while exercising (and it most often starts if I start running or do a *sudden fast* motion), I might feel my heart suddenly change its pulse with a tiny flutter. It doesn't necessary get super fast-- in fact it usually only increases bpm a bit, I'm already exercising and its high-- but it might be described as switching from a ba-DUM ba-DUM to a more ba-ba-ba type pattern. After that, if I don't stop exercising it will stay like that, and eventually (e.g. if I am running a track race) I will feel myself get a bit weaker/slower, and one time I even had my vision drain black by the end (though didn't pass out, nor felt like I would). I have to stop moving to get it to end, and try to just calm it down.\n\nI discovered by myself what I eventually researched to be a 'vagal maneuver'-- if I go upside down (or at least put chest lower-down, hunched over), my heart might flutter for a second then restore itself to normal. Otherwise, deep calming breaths (even holding a deep breath for a few seconds) can make it flutter and restore. It happened most as a high school athlete, nowadays (age 32, still running but only casually) it might happen only every couple months (not going 'as hard', I guess).\n\n(Also, I occasionally feel a single heart flutter randomly, but it doesn't activate this 'mode' described above, and my normal heart rhythm is unchanged...)\n\nEDIT: I should add I just had an EKG for my PCP and nothing was noted as abnormal, so my heart is normal when not 'having this episode' thing go on.\n\nCan anyone point me to a couple terms or things I might research further?... Thanks very much!!",

Since then I have had palpitations on and off so get this checked out every few years.\n\nI had some tests recently and all was ok, blood pressure was a little up, echocardiogram was ok.  But slight thickening of heart wall which was noticed in my 20s as well.  The doctor suggested I have an MRI as a precaution.\n\nTo cut a long a long story short my MRI showed scarring on my heart.  The doctor basically said I had a heart attack , which is something I am completely unaware of.  He couldn’t tell me timing of it or much else.\n\nI’ve had a band of pain around my back and chest on and off over the years, but went to get this checked out a few times when it happened and was told it wasn’t heart related.  I recently had a number of EKGs blood tests and nothing suggested a heart attack.\n\nAm am now going to have some tests done to check for heart decease etc.  it’s lucky I had the MRI, I only got it because I am with private health in UK.\n\nI am in general good health so it’s all a bit strange.  Was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this, being told they had a heart attack but being unaware of it, and no signs with medical checks or symptoms.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\n  \nI'm not used to asking strangers on Reddit for medical advice but if anyone can tell me what this EKG actually indicates in English, I would appreciate it.\n\nBackground - I just turned 65 in August. I need to lose 50 lbs, but exercise a good bit and am in fairly good aerobic health. I just did an 80 mile mountain bike tour over 3 days in Utah last month with no issues. I have a resting heart rate in the mid 50's. Back in May I had a physical and the GP said he saw something abnormal on the EKG, so he sent me to a cardiologist. He did another EKG and said it looked fine but then scheduled a cardiac calcium test and a stress test. The cardiac calcium came back with a 0 score, indicating no blockage. I had the stress test yesterday and he said it was abnormal. I asked in what way was it abnormal and he just said it was below the line, which tells me nothing. He scheduled me for a CT scan but that it not until almost Christmas. So I guess I am wondering if I have anything to be worried about. I'm guessing that it must not be too serious as hopefully if it was he would have gotten me in sooner. This is what my EKG says.\n\n  \n*Symptoms/Reason for Exam: Abnormal EKG*\n\n *Cardiac Risk Factors: none*\n\n *Previous Cardiac Procedures include: No Previous Coronary History*\n\n ***Procedure:***\n\n*Resting:  EKG shows Normal sinus rhythm, lvh*\n\n*Stress: EKG shows st depression in infwerior leaads c/w ischemia*\n\n*Recovery: EKG shows resolution of st chnages*\n\n *The patient exercised on a treadmill for a total of 9:30 minutes, reaching stage 3 of the Bruce Protocol, achieving an estimated work load of 11.2 METS.  The test was terminated for target achieved, fatigue, and leg fatigue.  The HR was 56 bpm at baseline and was 147 bpm at peak exercise.  The peak HR of 147 represents 94% of MPHR (132 TGT HR). Resting BP was 140/87 mmHg, and peak BP was 210/89 mmHg. The BP response was hypertensive.*  \n\n *The patient experienced the following symptoms during the procedure: fatigue\\`*\n\n *Dysrhythmias: yes, evidence of ventricular couplets in recovery*\n\n *The EKG shows a positive test.*\n\n ***Impression****: abnormal*\n\n ***Recommendations****: Advised further follow-up.  Will arrange for CCTA of the coronary*\n\n  \nFWIW, I felt like I could have gone a few more minutes on the stress test after he stopped it. \n\n  \nThanks for any feedback. \n\n\n\n  \n",

Most of the testing I’ve had done was related to my HA, but I always thought it was chest pain, shortness of breath, or my heart skipping around. Sometimes the PVC’s last for 5-10 seconds, which I’ve read can be NSVT or VT. I’ve also had an EKG in the middle of a panic attack that showed sinus tachycardia, t-wave abnormality, and inferior myocardial infarction. The follow up EKG showed everything to be normal, as well as the labs. \n\nI say all of that to say this: I read where someone asked about ARVC. I had never heard of it (and now I wish I never did) but it has me convinced that it’s something I might have or my kids might get. I don’t have any family history of sudden death, but my mother has had mitral valve prolapse and skipped beats throughout her life. I say all of that to ask this: \n\nIs ARVC something I should be concerned with? Can anyone in the cardiac field provide peace of mind? ",

I was then seen by my PCP who ordered a 48 Holter Monitor to be sure everything was okay. I have the results and it looks like I have PACs, not PVCs, and a 16% burden. I'm hoping someone can look at this and maybe offer reassurance that I'm not in immediate danger or let me know if I need to push being seen by a specialist. If it helps, I had an echocardiogram in 2021 and was told all was well. Thank you for your time and any insight you might be able to offer.",

I don’t remember the exact numbers for my heart rate but attached is the blood pressure results. He’s thinking it might be orthostatic hypotension but my heart rate was also more than 30 bpm difference going from lying to standing. He said it all might be due to dehydration originally but then I told him that I drink approximately 120 ounces of water a day, and all my lab work looked relatively normal so that wouldn’t really explain it. If I’m not laying down or sitting back my heart rate spikes anywhere between 130-180 with light activity. Eating and drinking makes my heart rate go up at least 25bpm and I can feel my heart racing. It started out as random irregularities but now it’s to the point that it’s all over the place unless I’m lying or sitting down. I am going to get a heart monitor for two weeks and eventually an echocardiogram and a stress test but those won’t be until the beginning of the year unless there’s cancellations. Anyone have any ideas on what could be going on? The blood pressure and heart rate at the top of the picture are from when I first sat down at the appointment. ",

    "selftext": "I was brought to the ER last year, early December, due to me freaking out about a feeling in my throat. Turned out my troponin was elevated to 213ng/L, so I was kept in the hospital for a suspected myocarditis. EKG and echo were clean. MRI was clean too, so they ruled out myocarditis and determined that my heightened troponin was due to physical exercise (I worked out before I had that feeling in my throat). My levels stabilized after a few days.\n\nThey found some tachycardia I had a few times daily, got put on bisoprolol 1.25mg for this. I had a few bouts of tachycardia since then, usually during exercise as a short bout of extra fast heartrate, a few times during rest.\n\nNow for a week, my heart has been going insane. Many bouts of tachycardia, many very heavy palpitations, weird feeling in my left shoulder and left arm, lots of muscle spasms, breathlessness and a very odd feeling of like a tube going from my throat to my chest.  I can also feel this tube when I lay my hand on my chest during walking, in my hand. I was sick and started working out again, after two workouts on two consecutive days, these symptoms started\n\nI was at my cardio today and the EKG and echo were clean. She said I should do another 24-hour holter in late December after I did one in May that came up clean. But my palpitations are so bad now and my breath is so hard to catch, I need to go to urgent care tomorrow morning.\n\nI really want to figure out the root of this issue. Is an angiogram, EP study or something like that appropriate? My heart has put a tremendous strain on my mental health over the last year\n\nAlso I am 194cm, 92kg and I have MS\n\nEdit: also some things that are notable: I don't smoke, I don't drink, I am physically effective, eat healthy, don't take drugs. I have one small coffee daily.  ",

She had it implanted, went off Eliquis and the falls stopped.  The afib did not.\n\nAfter the watchman she transferred care to a different cardiologist because of his location.  A year or so ago, they put her on baby aspirin.  I questioned her about it since she had the watchman but she didn't seem to know the answer and I figured baby aspirin was harmless.  She started getting large red splotches on her arms anytime she touched something and the dr said it was the aspirin and put her back on Eliquis. She now has a pace maker and still enters afib frequently.  The real kicker is the falls are back and we are in the er getting checked out multiple times a week again.  I cannot find anything online about continuing blood thinners after having a watchman implanted - in fact, the internet tells me the opposite.  Can anyone enlighten me?

If I’m sitting down doing absolutely nothing, I’m fine besides the pressure in my chest. Even sitting  eating/drinking/talking and I can feel my heart start to race again, usually sitting around 115. If I stand in one spot it’s around 130, but if I start walking or go up stairs it’s around 150. The ecg at the hospital showed tachycardia and short PR intervals, but otherwise everything else was normal. I’m only 29 years old. I’m not in the best shape ever, but I am a probation officer and a mom of two young kids so it’s also not like I sit around on my butt all day. However, this is really starting to mess with my quality of life and I’m really worried that I won’t get answers tomorrow and I’ll have to continue going through this. ",

After the worst half marathon of my life (it was number 6 or 7 for me, I walk for most of the mileage), I finally decided to see my dr about my symptoms again. They were previously written off as asthma even though daily inhalers showed no improvement and albuterol did not curb symptoms when exercising nor did it show a difference on PFTs. The following is a summary of my cardio appointment:\n\n“Exam is completely unremarkable. EKG today is sinus at 90 bpm with a borderline right axis. The chest discomfort is unusual and that it is extremely reproducible with running. And it never occurs at rest. I am concerned that she may have a congenital coronary anomaly such as anomalous origin of the right coronary artery which may be getting trapped and causing the problem.”\n\nOf course, off to Dr. Google I went and alas, scary information. Cardio felt CCTA will probably come back normal due to rarity of condition, but obviously until then I have no other ideas.\n\nCardio won’t discuss other options until he gets these results back but the soonest I can be seen (so far) is January. Any other ideas on what this could be? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone.\n\nSorry if this sounds like a rant but im curious what other peoples opinions are\n\nOver the past month ive had 4 episodes of my heart rate suddenly jumping to 200. After going to the hospital a couple times the electrophysiologist suggest a loop recorder, which based on my research, is a minor procedure with little to no pain at all.  Unfortunately for me, my experience went as poorly as it could’ve.\n\nThe first thing that happened was me having an allergic reaction to something. Maybe it was the numbing they used, I don’t know, but I felt my throat swell up and when the procedure was finished my heart rate was already at 200. I was yelling to the guys that im having an allergic reaction and my throat was steady swelling up, yet this seemed to have dumbfounded everyone. It’s like they actually couldn’t grasp someone having a severe allergic reaction since they were just looking at me confused on what to do. Im screaming for them to get me an epi pen and no one reacts, so I point to the epi pen I brought in (thank god I thought ahead) and used it myself since they were so incompetent.\n\nThe next part was the worst, I suddenly started to feel severe pain in my chest in the area it was implanted. The pain at first was so bad I was screaming at the top of my lungs because I thought I was about to die. It’s been 5 hours, and the pain is still so unbearable I can’t breathe all the way in because it hurts so much. While im laying there screaming for help, again, it’s like these guys’ brains just stopped functioning. My heart rate continued to climb, I start sweating, and im screaming for help and these guys are just staring at me. The actual surgeon that did the procedure was also trash, he kept squeezing the area trying to figure out where it was even while I yelling at him to stop touching me, even trying to shove him off because he was hurting me so much.\n\nI’ve done a chest X-ray and he said that the loop recorder is in a normal location, but clearly there’s something wrong. The pain is so bad I was put on fentanyl and I am barely functioning still. Im very scared that something went wrong during my procedure and since no symptoms seem to be going away. Even my new current nurse said she’s seen this procedure done a thousand times and no one has reacted like I have.\n\n \n\nI guess my question is, what could they have done wrong? im just praying at this point I dont fall ill due to other peoples incompetence. Also im sorry if i sound like a karen, im never one to complain or say things under my breathe when i pass someone, but this whole situation just seems so unfair to me.",

I have attached them in the image section.\n\nI guess my question is, how should the persistent and sometimes extreme QRS axis shift pattern be interpreted? Is this universally classified as a benign positional/vertical heart variant, maybe given my high BMI? Or does the rising trend still warrant any further investigation?\n\nI should note that I am not currently diagnosed with any heart condition and am not aware of any heart attacks. The reason for so many ecg's in the last year is because I found out a drug I was taking (Lexapro 20mg) was causing many scary PVC's. They went away after switching to 10mg. Also had a couple of panic attacks.\n\nI appreciate any advice I could get and I apologize for the long post. Just been worried going through these old records.",

However the dr also kept pushing telling me that i have anxiety etc bc i asked if there is more testing to make sure its nothing more severe. They sent me home on propranolol. \n\nHe did sent his notes to my cardiologist who ordered stress test (which i did today and everything seems normal and great) and an echo i will have in December. She also referred me to EP( appointment in june)\n\nThe cardiologist also seems to be very set on the anxiety issue. I was never diagnosed with anxiety nor do i have it or had issues with it but yes it stressed me out not knowing what was happening to my body during these two episodes and I asked if there is more testing bc all they did is ecg before they diagnosed it as SVT. Because i aske if there is other testing the hospital dr said i have anxiety. \n\nNow it basically feels like they are constantly telling me that my mental health is bad and that that is what is causing it, which makes me question the need for the medication. I have been feeling a lot better over the last few days compared to how I started feeling after my first episode , but I am unsure if I should even continue the medication if everybody seems to believe it’s just caused by anxiety, which I actually was never diagnosed with and never had but because of the notes of the hospital doctor, everybody is set on me having anxiety. I am actually super offended by this. I felt anxious after the fact this started happening not before. I am frustrated because at first they didn’t even believe me i was having anything going on with my heart untill they caught the episode. \n",

Also interesting to note that making sure the top of my head is submerged as well as my face seems to increase the success rate.\n\nOnly question now is the cause of attacks in the first place.  The only connection I can think of over the years is I have noticed they might occur after a sudden movement, such as quickly bending over to pick something up or a sudden awkward movement - such as if you dodged a ball during dodgeball.  But, I'm not saying it would guarantee it would happen, just that most of the time there does seem to be a connection between a sudden awkward movement and an SVT attack.\n\nCurious if anyone has insight, but also in case anyone hasn't heard of the mammalian dive reflex it is a good one to check out\n\n  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_97x5R2odDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_97x5R2odDI)\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/@JAMANetwork)\n\n",
