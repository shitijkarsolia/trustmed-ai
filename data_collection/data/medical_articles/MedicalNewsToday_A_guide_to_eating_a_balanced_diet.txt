A balanced diet fulfills all of a person’s nutritional needs. It comprises foods from five groups — fruits, vegetables, protein, grains, and dairy — and can help manage weight and reduce the risk of disease.

Dietary guidelines evolve with scientific advances, so it can be challenging to stay on top of current recommendations and know what to eat.

In this article, we look at current dietary recommendations and describe how to build a balanced diet.

What is a balanced diet?

A balanced diet is one that fulfills all of a person’s nutritional needs. Humans need a certain amount of calories andnutrientsto stay healthy.

A balanced dietshould provide all the nutrients a person requires without going over therecommended daily calorie intake.Adults typically require between1,600 to 3,000 calories per day, but this can vary according to a person’s sex, age, and lifestyle.

By eating a balanced diet, people can get the nutrients and calories they need and avoid eating junk food or food with little nutritional value.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) used to recommend following a food pyramid. However, as nutritional science has changed, they now recommend eating foods from the five groups and building a balanced plate.

According to theUSDA’s recommendations, half of a person’s plate should consist of fruits and vegetables.

The other half should be made up of grains and protein. They recommend accompanying each meal with a serving of low fat dairy or another source of the nutrients found in dairy.

A healthful, balanced diet includes foods from these five groups:

The vegetable group includes five subgroups:

dark green vegetables

red andorangevegetables

beans, peas, and lentils

other vegetables, such aseggplantor zucchini

To get enough nutrients and keep dietary boredom at bay, people should choose a variety of vegetables.

Additionally, theUSDA recommendsthat people eat vegetables from each of the five subgroups every week.

People may enjoy vegetables raw or cooked. However, it is important to remember that cooking vegetables removes some of their nutritional value. Also, some methods, such as deep-frying, can add unhealthful fats to a dish.

A balanced diet also includes plenty of fruit. Instead of getting fruit from juice, nutritionexpertsrecommend eating whole fruits.

Juicecontains fewernutrients. Also, the manufacturing process often adds empty calories due toadded sugar. People should opt for fresh or frozen fruits or fruits canned in water instead of syrup.

When choosingjuices, always opt for 100% fruit juices.

There aretwo subgroups:whole grainsand refined grains.

Whole grains include all three parts of the grain, which are the bran, germ, and endosperm. The body breaks down whole grains slowly, so they have less effect on a person’s blood sugar.

Additionally, whole grains tend to contain morefiberand protein than refined grains.

Refined grains are processed and do not contain the three original components. Refined grains also tend to have less protein and fiber, and they can cause blood sugar spikes.

Grains used to form the base of the government-approved food pyramid, meaning that most of a person’s daily caloric intake came from grains. However, the updated guidelines suggest that grains should make up only a quarter of a person’s plate.

At least half of the grains that a person eats daily should be whole grains. Healthful whole grainsinclude:

The2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americansstate that all people should include nutrient-dense protein as part of their regular diet.

The guidelines suggest that this protein should make up a quarter of a person’s plate.

Nutritious protein choices include:

beans, peas, and legumes

Dairy and fortifiedsoy productsare a vital source ofcalcium. TheUSDA recommendsconsuming low-fat or fat-free versions whenever possible.

Low fat dairy and soy products include:

ricotta or cottage cheese

People who arelactose intolerantcan opt for low-lactose or lactose-free products, or choose soy-based sources of calcium and other nutrients.

An inadequate diet is a common reason why people find it challenging to lose weight.

When combined with aregular exerciseroutine, a balanced diet can help a person reduce their risk factors forobesityor gaining weight.

A balanced diet can help a person lose weight by:

increasing their protein intake

avoiding excessivecarbohydratesor processed foods

getting essential nutrients, includingminerals,vitamins, and fiber

preventing binge eating

People interested inlosing weightshould begin or enhance an exercise routine.

For some people, adding30 minutesofwalkingeach day and making minor changes, such as taking the stairs, can help them burn calories and lose weight.

For those who can, adding moderate exercise that includescardioandresistance trainingwill help speed up weight loss.

Eating a balanced diet means eating foods from the five major groups.

Dietary guidelines change over time as scientists discover new information about nutrition. Current recommendations suggest that a person’s plate should contain primarily vegetables and fruits, somelean protein, some dairy, and soluble fiber.

People interested in weight loss should also consider introducing moderate exercise into their routines.
