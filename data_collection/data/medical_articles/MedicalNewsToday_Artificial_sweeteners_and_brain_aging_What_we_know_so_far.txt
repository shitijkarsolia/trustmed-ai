Can artificial sweeteners actually be harmful to health? And can consuming them on the regular affect our memory and thinking skills? Although a new link found between sugar alternatives and brain aging requires more study, it may warrant some concern.MNTspeaks to a physician and researcher to dive deeper into the matter and discuss In Conversation

Artificial sweetenerscome in many different names and forms — as liquids or powders, as sucralose, erythritol, aspartame, and more. They are consumed bymillions of peoplearound the world, and especially bypeople with diabetes.

The main reason behind the recommendation for people with diabetes to swapsugarfor sugar alternatives is that the latter are believed to causefewer blood sugar spikes.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has alsoapproved several artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame, as well as sugar alcohols like xylitol and erythritol, and plant-based sugar substitutes like stevia and monk fruit, as safe for consumption.

However, in recent years, more and more research has emerged about thepossible long-term health effectsof consuming sugar alternatives.

The most recent one was a study published inNeurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, which found that the sweeteners — aspartame, saccharin,acesulfame-K, erythritol, xylitol, andsorbitol— were linked to declines in memory and overall thinking skills that were equivalent to about 1.6 years of brain aging.

Such research has stirred controversy and concern among the public, but does this mean people should stop consuming artificial sweeteners altogether? And what other possible effects could they have on health?

To discuss this and more,Claudia Suemoto, MD, PhD, senior author of the Neurology study, joinedMedical News Todayeditors Yasemin Nicola Sakay and Maria Cohut on thisepisode ofIn Conversation, looking at artificial sweeteners’ effects on health, particularly the brain.

Suemoto is a physician and assistant professor of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, where she is also an epidemiologist focused ondementiaresearch and brain aging.

She is also currently one of the coordinators of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group — the largest brain bank in Latin America. In 2016, she was awarded the L’Oreal UNESCO For Women in Science in Brazil.
