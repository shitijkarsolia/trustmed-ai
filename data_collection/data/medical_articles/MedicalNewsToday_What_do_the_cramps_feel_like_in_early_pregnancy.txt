Implantation cramping may be an early sign of pregnancy. Understanding the differences between early pregnancy cramps and period cramps will help people to recognize them.

Implantation cramping is a type of pain sometimes experienced when a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. This process is called implantation. Cramping sometimes occurs when this happens, but it does not always cause pain.

Anyone experiencing implantation cramps should avoid taking some anti-inflammatory medications, such asaspirin. This is because taking anti-inflammatory medicines around the time of conception might increase the risk of miscarriage, according to a2003 study.

Implantation cramps vs. period cramps

Implantation cramps are not the same as period or menstrual cramps.

Menstrual cramps happen during a period, which occurs approximately once every 28 days, so long as there is no pregnancy.

Menstrual cramps happen when the uterus contracts to expel its lining.

Substances called prostaglandins trigger the uterine muscles to contract.

Prostaglandins are associated with pain andinflammation. This process may cause cramping.

Are cramps and bleeding common?

Not everyone gets implantation cramps and bleeding when they first become pregnant.

One-quarter of participants in a2010 studyreportedbleeding in their first trimester. Only 8 percent of those had heavy bleeding.

28 percent of those who had spotting and light bleeding also reported pain. 54 percent of those with heavy bleeding also experienced pain.

It is unusual to have intense cramping pain during implantation, so anyone who experiences painful cramping between periods should be assessed by a doctor.

Implantation tends to happen6 to 10 daysafterovulationwhen pregnancy occurs. This is about the same time that a person would usually expect a period to start.

If an egg has been fertilized, the body prepares the uterus lining to receive and protect the egg.

Some light bleeding or spotting may accompany implantation cramping. This is called implantation bleeding and is lighter than a regular period.

Around2 weeksafter implantation,hCG levelswill be high enough for a pregnancy test to be positive.

If the pregnancy test is positive, the next step is to make an appointment with a doctor. The doctor can confirm whether the home test is correct.

Anyone who already knows they are pregnant and is experiencing heavy bleeding or cramping should speak to a doctor. These symptomsmay indicatea problem with the pregnancy.
