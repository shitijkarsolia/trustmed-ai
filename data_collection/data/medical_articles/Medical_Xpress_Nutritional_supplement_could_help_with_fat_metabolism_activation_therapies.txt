Dr. Ann Coulter of Pennington Biomedical Research Center recently presented research on a novel nutritional supplement that targets fat cells to stimulate weight loss at theBio on the Bayou conferencein New Orleans.

Dr. Coulter, director of Pennington Biomedical's Human Obesity Laboratory, shared findings from her collaborative work with Dr. Frank Greenway on a new approach to combating obesity and related metabolic diseases with naturally occurring compounds. Her presentation, titled "Targeting Adipose Tissue to Stimulate Weight Loss by Energy Expenditure," highlighted a natural supplement that acts directly onfat cellsto increaseenergy expenditureand improve insulin sensitivity.

"Most current obesity treatments work by suppressing appetite in the brain," said Dr. Coulter. "We have developed a combination of natural compounds that targets the body's fat cells and reprograms them to metabolize fat rather than store it. Our data suggests that our treatment will not only support weight loss but will also addressfatty liver diseaseand diabetes, all without the side effects commonly seen with current prescription drugs."

The supplement is composed of three food ingredients: naringenin, which is found in oranges;beta carotene; and artepillin C, which is derived from Brazilian green propolis. Earlyclinical datademonstrated that low-dose naringenin alone led to an averageweight lossof 2.5 kilograms in four weeks, along with reductions in liver fat and cholesterol.

"The treatment developed by Dr. Coulter and Dr. Greenway shows promise as a potential method of activatingfat metabolismwith naturally occurring components," said Dr. John Kirwan, executive director of Pennington Biomedical.

"At Pennington Biomedical, we remain committed to improving human metabolic health. This component is representative of the many approaches we take in pursuit of this goal. We are proud to have her present at Bio on the Bayou and share this advancement with the extensive life sciences community in the Gulf South."

When combined, the three compounds, collectively referred to as NBA, produced a 60-fold increase in a key gene that stimulates triglyceride metabolism and energy expenditure in human fat cells. The supplement also improved liver metabolism and systemic insulin sensitivity in preliminary studies. The compound ingredients are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), as designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
