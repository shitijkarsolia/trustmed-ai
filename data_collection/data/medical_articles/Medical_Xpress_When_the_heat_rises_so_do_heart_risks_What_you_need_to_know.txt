It's only the first day of summer and record high temperatures are already being reported across much of the U.S. with a forecasted heat wave that could smash records in the Northeast and Midwest. That's prompted the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, to issue important warnings about taking extra precautions to stay safe in extremely high temperatures.

According to theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 1,200 people die in the U.S. each year as a direct cause of extreme heat. That number is rising substantially—as is the number of people dying from heat-related cardiovascular disease. Astudypublished in the journalCirculationpredicts that cardiovascular disease deaths related toextreme heatmay more than double over the next two decades.

Heat and dehydration cause the heart to work harder, putting it under significant stress. This can be particularly problematic for those with heart conditions and older adults. Certainheart medications, such asbeta blockers, ACE receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors,calcium channel blockersand diuretics (which deplete the body of sodium), can exaggerate the body's response to heat.

The Association suggests those who have been prescribed these medications take extra precautions duringheat wavesbut continue to take their medications unless told otherwise by their health care professional.

Precautions to take during these hot days of summer:

Watch the clock: It's best to avoid the outdoors in the early afternoon (about noon to 3 p.m.) because the sun is usually at its strongest, putting you at higher risk for heat-related illnesses.

Dress for the heat: Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing in breathable fabrics such as cotton, or a newer fabric that repels sweat.

Drink up: Stay hydrated by drinking a few cups of water before, during and after going outside or exercising. Avoid caffeinated or alcoholic beverages.

Take regular breaks: Find some shade or a cool place, stop for a few minutes, hydrate and start again.

It's important to know the signs and symptoms when you may be experiencing too much heat.

Symptoms of heat exhaustion:

Cool, pale and moist skin

Dizziness and lightheadedness

Weakness or muscle cramps

If you experience these symptoms, move to a cooler place, stop exercising and cool down immediately by dousing yourself with cold water and rehydrating. You may need to seek medical attention.

Heat stroke is a medical emergency, if you experience these symptoms call 9-1-1 and get medical attention right away.

Symptoms of heat stroke:

High body temperature (103°F or higher)

Hot, red, dry or damp skin

Headache, dizziness and confusion

While being heart-smart in the heat, it's still important to find ways for the whole family to stay active even during thehigh temperaturesof summer. Adjusting your activity time to early morning or later in the evening can help. If being outside is just too much on some days, find indoor locations where you can be active, such as a shopping mall, gym or community recreation center.
