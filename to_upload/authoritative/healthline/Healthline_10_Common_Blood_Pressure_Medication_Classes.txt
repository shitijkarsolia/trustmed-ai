Multiple classes of medications, known as antihypertensives, are available to treat high blood pressure, and each class works in a different way.

Diuretics are often used as a first-line treatment to help the kidneys remove excess water and sodium, while other medications like ACE inhibitors and ARBs prevent blood vessels from narrowing.

A doctor will consider factors such as additional medical conditions and side effects to determine the most appropriate medication or combination of medications for you.

High blood pressurecan lead to many serious health problems, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Treating high blood pressure early is important in preventing these and other problems.

With so many medication options available, finding the best one for you may take some time and patience. A doctor will work with you to find the best treatment plan for you, which may include one or more medications.

The following chart summarizes the major classes of blood pressure medications, indications for use, and their side effects.

Diuretics are some of the most commonly used drugs for treating high blood pressure. Theyhelp the kidneysget rid of excess water and sodium, or salt. This reduces the volume of blood that needs to pass through your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.

There are three major types of diuretics:

Discovereverything you need to know about diuretics, their types, and specific examples.

In certain situations, your bodymakeshormones called catecholamines. These hormonescan bindto parts of cells called alpha receptors. When this occurs, your blood vessels narrow, and your heart beats faster and with more force. These actions cause your blood pressure to rise.

Alpha-blockers work by blocking catecholamines from binding to alpha receptors. As a result, blood can flow through the blood vessels more freely, and your heart beats normally. This helps lower your blood pressure.

Alpha-blockers includedoxazosin(Cardura, Cardura XL),prazosin(Minipress), andterazosin.

3. Alpha receptor agonists

These medications perform the opposite function of alpha-blockers. A blocker (antagonist) is a drug that binds to the receptor, preventing it from triggering any responses.

An agonist, on the other hand, is a drug thatbindsto the same receptor and stimulates it in a way that’s similar to that of the primary chemical. The primary chemicals, in this case, are alpha-1 or alpha-2 proteins. This calms thesympathetic nervous system, which leads to less production of adrenaline and lower blood pressure.

An example of an alpha-2 agonist ismethyldopa. Examples of alpha-1 agonists arephenylephrine (Sudafed PE) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).

Another type of alpha receptor agonist is sometimes classified separately as central agonists.

Central agonist medicationskeepthe brain from sending messages to the nervous system telling it to release catecholamines. As a result, the heart doesn’t pump as hard, and blood flows more easily, lowering blood pressure.

Methyldopais also considered a central agonist, as areclonidine(Catapres) andguanfacine(Tenex).

Beta-blockers work byblockingthe actions of hormones in your body that stimulate your heart. This allows your heart to beat with less speed and force, leading to a decrease in blood pressure.

Beta-blockers can further bedividedas follows:

Selective:These only block beta-1 receptors found in the heart muscle.

Nonselective:These block both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors (found in the lungs and other smooth muscle).

In addition, some beta-blockers have a combined effect. Combined alpha- and beta-blockers block the binding of catecholamine hormones to both alpha- and beta-receptors.

Discovereverything you need to know about beta-blockers, their types, and specific examples.

5. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors

ACE inhibitors keep the body from making a hormone called angiotensin II, which causes blood vessels to narrow. These medications lower blood pressure by helping constricted blood vessels expand to let more blood through. ACE inhibitorsaren’t safeto take during pregnancy.

Discovereverything you need to know about ACE inhibitors, their types, and specific examples.

6. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)

This class of drugs alsoprotectsthe blood vessels from angiotensin II. In order to tighten blood vessels, angiotensin II must bind with a receptor site. ARBs prevent that from happening. As a result, blood pressure is lowered.

Like ACE inhibitors, ARBsaren’t safeto take during pregnancy.

Discovereverything you need to know about ARBs, their types, and specific examples.

7. Calcium channel blockers

To move, all muscles need calcium to flow in and out of the muscle cells. Calcium channel blockershelp blockcalcium from entering the smooth muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels. This makes the heart beat with less force and helps blood vessels relax. As a result, blood pressure decreases.

There aretwocategories of calcium channel blockers:

Non-dihydropyridine (non-DHP):These have a direct effect on the electrical signals to the heart muscle.

Dihydropyridine (DHP):These have an effect on other (peripheral) blood vessels in the body.

Discover everything you need to know aboutcalcium channel blockers, their types, and specific examples.

Vasodilators relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels, especially in small arteries called arterioles. This widens the blood vessels and allows blood to flow through them more easily. As a result, blood pressure falls.

Discovereverything you need to know about vasodilators, their types, and specific examples.

9. Aldosterone receptor antagonists

Aldosterone receptor antagonistswork byblockinga chemical called aldosterone. This action reduces the amount of fluid your body retains, which helps lower your blood pressure.

Aldosterone receptor antagonists includeeplerenone(Inspra) andspironolactone(Aldactone).

10. Direct renin inhibitors

Another type of blood pressure medication is called a direct renin inhibitor (DRI). DRIs block a chemical in your body called renin. This action helps widen your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.

The only type of DRI that’scurrently availablein the United States is aliskiren (Tekturna).

High blood pressure drug treatment plans

There are times when you may need to take more than one type of blood pressure medication. Most commonly, this occurs when:

your initial treatment,typicallywith diuretics, isn’t effective

you have an additional medical condition along with high blood pressure, such ascoronary artery disease (CAD)ordiabetes, or you’ve had a heart attack

if you have grade 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or diastolic of at least 90 mm Hg), youmay need additionalblood pressure medications

Frequently asked questions

What are the main BP meds?

Diuretics are often the first medication prescribed when an individual is diagnosed with high blood pressure, so they are a popular choice. The top fourmost prescribed medicationsto treat high blood pressure are:

lisinopril(Prinivil and Zestril),an ACE inhibitor

amlodipine(Norvasc), a DHP calcium channel blocker

metoprolol(Lopressor), a beta-blocker

metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL), extended release

hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic

What blood pressure medication is good for anxiety?

Propranolol is a commonly prescribed beta-blocker. It’sprescribed to treathypertension, anxiety, and migraine.

What is the most common blood pressure medication?

Thiazide-type diuretics are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure. However, doctors consider several factors when prescribing a blood pressure medication, including the indication for its use, dosing frequency, and other conditions. All of these can vary from person to person. Within certain drug classes, more commonly prescribed options can vary based on fewer side effects or whether generic options are available.

What is the safest high blood pressure pill?

The safest medication for high blood pressure depends on your specific levels and any other health conditions you have. The classes used as first-line therapies, medications doctors typically prescribe before any others,includethe thiazide-type diureticsmetolazoneandhydrochlorothiazide.

What supplements should I avoid with high blood pressure?

If you have high blood pressure, it’s best to talk with a doctor before adding any new supplements. However, you may want to avoid supplements thatcan raiseblood pressure, such as bitter orange, ephedra, ginseng, and licorice root. You may also want to avoid those that can interact with your prescribed medications, which can vary.

High blood pressure is a serious condition that requires treatment to prevent more severe health problems.

Don’t worry if you’re confused by all of your medication options. A doctor can tell you which drugs might work best for you. Together, you can put together a treatment plan to manage your blood pressure.
