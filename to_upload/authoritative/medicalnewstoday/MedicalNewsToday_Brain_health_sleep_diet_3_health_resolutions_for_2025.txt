Taking care of oneself requires a multi-faceted approach: brain, heart, and metabolic health. What research in 2024 has shown us is that improving our health in these areas comes down to three main factors: sleep, diet, and exercise. But how does one start taking action with this intention? And how can we break down such lifestyle changes into manageable steps?
