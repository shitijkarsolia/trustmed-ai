Insulinis a hormone that takes sugar from foods and moves it to the body’s cells. If the body does not make enoughinsulinor does not use insulin well, the sugar from food stays in the blood, resulting in high blood sugar.

Diabetesis a key health concern worldwide. In the United States, the rate of new cases rose sharply from the 1990s, but itfell between 2008 and 2015, and it continues to fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Diabetes Report, 2017. Meanwhile, the number of adults living with diabetes continues to rise.

The most common of diabetes is type 2. According to the CDC,90 to 95 percentof people with diabetes in the United States have type 2. Just 5 percent of people have type 1.

Diabetes is at an all-time high in the U.S. The CDC’s Division of Diabetes Translation states that1 percentof the population, which is about a half of a million people, had diagnosed diabetes in 1958.

In 2015, around9.4 percentof the population in the U.S. had diabetes, including 30.2 million adults aged 18 years and over. Nearly a quarter of those with the condition do not know they have it.

Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people living with diabetesmore than tripled, and the number of new cases doubled every year.

Figuressuggestthat the incidence is levelling off and may even be falling, but it remains unclear whether this will continue as other factors come into play, such as the aging population.

The risk of developing diabetes increases with age.

TheCDC reportthat 4.0 percent of people aged 18 to 44 years are living with diabetes, 17 percent of those aged 45 to 64 years, and 25.2 percent of those aged over 65 years.

Type 2 diabetesis thought to result from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.

Scientists do not know the exact cause, but risk factorsappear to include:

high blood pressureorcholesterol

having a close family member with the condition

a history of gestational diabetes

Asobesityhas become more prevalent over the past few decades, so too has the rate oftype 2 diabetes. In 2013,more than 1 in 3 peoplein the U.S. were considered to have obesity, and over 2 in 3 were either overweight or had obesity.

In 1995, obesity affected15.3 percentof Americans, and in 2008, the figure was 25.6 percent. From 1998 to 2008, the incidence of diabetes increased by 90 percent.

Although the link between obesity and diabetes is well known, the reasons for the link remain unclear.A reportin theJournal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolismasks why, if there is a link, obesity does not always lead to diabetes.

The same report notes that the location of body fat appears to play a role. People with more fat in the upper body area and around the waist are more likely to get diabetes than those who carry their body fat around the hips and lower body.

Diabetes and ethnicity

Rates of diabetes vary between ethnic groups.

There may be a combination of factors, including:

TheCDC’s National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017, found that, among people aged 20 years and over, diabetes affects:

non-Hispanic whites: 7.4 percent

Asian Americans: 8.0 percent

Hispanics: 12.1 percent

non-Hispanic blacks: 12.7 percent

American Indians and Alaska Natives: 15.1 percent

Why diabetes is serious

Diabetes can have serious health consequences.

TheADA reportthat more Americans die from diabetes every year than fromAIDSandbreast cancercombined.

According to the CDC,79,535 deathsoccur each year due to diabetes. The number of fatalities related to diabetes may be underreported.

Why and how does diabetes damage the body and cause complications?

Adults with diabetes are significantly more likely to die from aheart attackorstroke.

More than a quarter of all Americans with diabetes havediabetic retinopathy, which can cause vision loss and blindness.

Each year, nearly 50,000 Americans begin treatment for kidney failure due to diabetes. Diabetes accounts for 44 percent of all new cases of kidney failure.

Each year, diabetes causes about 73,000 lower limb amputations, which accounts for 60 percent of all lower limb amputations (not including amputations due to trauma).

Because of its high prevalence and link to numerous health problems, diabetes has a significant impact on healthcare costs.

The productivity loss for reduced performance at work due to diabetes in 2012 was 113 million days, or $20.8 billion,according to the ADA.

Diabetes cost the U.S.$327 billion in 2017, including $237 billion in medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity.

However, this number does not include:

the millions of people who have diabetes but no diagnosis

the cost of prevention programs for people with diabetes, which are not counted under standard medical costs

over-the-counter medications for eye and dental problems, which are more common in people with diabetes.

administrative costs for insurance claims

the cost of reduced quality of life, lost productivity of family members, and other factors that cannot be measured directly

Because diabetes affects various parts of the body, the medical costs span different areas of specialty. The ADA report that:

30 percent of medical costs associated with diabetes are for circulation problems that reduce blood flow to the limbs

29 percent of medical costs associated with diabetes are for kidney conditions

28 percent of medical costs associated with diabetes are for nervous system conditions

Despite its complications, people can manage their diabetes with a comprehensive plan that includes lifestyle changes and proper medical care. If they manage their blood sugar levels well, many people with diabetes can lead full, active lives.

Difference between types 1 and 2

Intype 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. As a result, the body does not produce insulin, and people with this condition must take insulin by injection or pump every day.

Type 1 diabetes usually develops in children or young adults, but it can occur at any age. There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes, and there is no cure.

In 2011-2012, around17,900 childrenunder the age of 18 years received a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in the U.S., or around 49 children each day. Type 1 diabetes affects around1.25 millionAmerican adults and children.

People with type 2 diabetes may still have insulin in their bodies, but not enough for proper blood sugar management. Or, the body may not be able to use the insulin it has properly. As a result, blood sugar levels can become too high.

Typically, adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but children can get it too. Certain factors increase a person’s risk of getting type 2 diabetes, including:

a family history of diabetes

problems with glucose metabolism

The annual relative increase for type 1 diabetes in 2002-2012 in the U.S. was1.8 percent, but the annual increase for type 2 diabetes was 4.8 percent.
