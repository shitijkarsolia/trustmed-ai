===============================================================================

Have a history of SVT from childhood but for years didn't know it was SVT until I happened to have one while in the hospital and they did an EKG. Took years to find a way to stop an attack using the mammalian dive reflex trick (dunking head in very cold water with ice) or using the Modified Valsalva Maneuver. In case anyone wondering, I've had the best luck with the mammalian dive reflex. Also interesting to note that making sure the top of my head is submerged as well as my face seems to increase the success rate. Only question now is the cause of attacks in the first place. The only connection I can think of over the years is I have noticed they might occur after a sudden movement, such as quickly bending over to pick something up or a sudden awkward movement - such as if you dodged a ball during dodgeball. But, I'm not saying it would guarantee it would happen, just that most of the time there does seem to be a connection between a sudden awkward movement and an SVT attack. Curious if anyone has insight, but also in case anyone hasn't heard of the mammalian dive reflex it is a good one to check out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_97x5R2odDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_97x5R2odDI) [](https://www.youtube.com/@JAMANetwork)

I recommend getting an ablation.
