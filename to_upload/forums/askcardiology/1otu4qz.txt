===============================================================================

I had an episode of SVT last week Friday ( troponin only rose to 9 then fell again while is Hospital i had another episode on sunday. This episode did lead to a SVT diagnosis. However the dr also kept pushing telling me that i have anxiety etc bc i asked if there is more testing to make sure its nothing more severe. They sent me home on propranolol. He did sent his notes to my cardiologist who ordered stress test (which i did today and everything seems normal and great) and an echo i will have in December. She also referred me to EP( appointment in june) The cardiologist also seems to be very set on the anxiety issue. I was never diagnosed with anxiety nor do i have it or had issues with it but yes it stressed me out not knowing what was happening to my body during these two episodes and I asked if there is more testing bc all they did is ecg before they diagnosed it as SVT. Because i aske if there is other testing the hospital dr said i have anxiety. Now it basically feels like they are constantly telling me that my mental health is bad and that that is what is causing it, which makes me question the need for the medication. I have been feeling a lot better over the last few days compared to how I started feeling after my first episode , but I am unsure if I should even continue the medication if everybody seems to believe it’s just caused by anxiety, which I actually was never diagnosed with and never had but because of the notes of the hospital doctor, everybody is set on me having anxiety. I am actually super offended by this. I felt anxious after the fact this started happening not before. I am frustrated because at first they didn’t even believe me i was having anything going on with my heart untill they caught the episode.

It’s pretty much doctor speak for “I don’t want to deal with this” to just say it’s anxiety. I had a neurologist tell me that I’d grow out of seizure like activity I was twenty, and wouldn’t set up an inpatient epilepsy test because he didn’t believe it they were true seizures. Yeah, he used the words true and not true not non epileptic and epileptic. After I was hospitalized for five days because had seizures three of those days and the hospital neurologist thought even with the atypical presentation I had epileptic seizures (I have a new neurologist she also thinks I have non epileptic which is most likely because if I was epileptic I would probably be dead) my primary neurologist wouldn’t refill my prescription at the correct dose of anticonvulsant despite having seen him since. My old neurologist also told me that my diagnosed POTS would be cured by therapy. He told me to therapy my dysautonomia away. I don’t know what talking about my feelings is going to do about the fact my body doesn’t know what to do with it’s juice stuffings when I am vertical but I don’t think it’s helping me not badly impersonate a fish that can breath air but is trying to hid it from the Chinese government as it breaks into a Wendy’s.
