===============================================================================

I have BAV and have known about it for about 13 years now after having an aneurysm when I was 5. I’ve started working out over the past two years (i’m 18 now) and recently got into the gym over the past month. I’m weight training to gain muscle and am a bit worried if I’m overdoing it. I feel great and haven’t had any major concerns or any side effects, but am just worried as i’m sure many of us do. I take pre workout, which has 2.5g of creatine and 168 mg of caffeine

In general, with BAV and a history of aneurysm, I know it’s important to avoid heavy straining and focus on moderate weights with steady breathing.
