TREADMILL STRESS TEST 32 female 118lbs Also being tested for pots Indication: Chest pain Protocol: Bruce protocol Exercise time: 4 minutes, 35 seconds Maximum METs: 7.1 Resting HR: 101 bpm Maximum HR: 180 bpm (95% of predicted maximum) Resting BP: 118/87 mmHg Peak BP: 166/86 mmHg Symptoms: Fatigue and chest pain Reason for stopping test: Fatigue Resting ECG: Normal sinus rhythm Stress ECG: 2 mm ST-segment depression at peak exercise Arrhythmias: None noted Interpretation: Positive for ischemia Conclusion: The patient achieved 95% of the predicted maximum heart rate with a workload of 7.1 METs. There was a 2 mm horizontal ST-segment depression noted at peak exercise consistent with ischemia. The patient experienced chest pain and fatigue during the test. Overall, this is a positive stress test for ischemia.

A positive stress test means the test detected signs that your heart muscle isn't getting enough blood during exercise. This is a very important piece of information that your doctors will now use to create a treatment plan for you to manage the condition and reduce your risk. False positives can and do occur, like hormones, anxiety, with certain heart rates, and other non-cardiac issues can sometimes cause ST-segment changes. Your doctor will now likely order a more definitive test.

If there is an underlying issue— they’ve caught things early enough to start intervention that won’t affect your life.
4. u/TurtleMac1030 [score=3, created=2025-11-11T15:47:29]: I've done 3 stress tests and I've had two false positives and one regular. They will most likely check your electrolytes as well as baseline ECG's and possible Imaging. If you are taking beta blockers already and have high anxiety than it is a recipe for false positives or even enough of a change in chemistry to temporarily cause positive results. Also it could just be the way your heart works. I've had several inverted T waves that were showing ischemia on several leads after tons of work up including stress tests, calcium CT, angiogram Etc. my heart is structurally fine and that's just the way it works.
5. u/lifeisg0od [score=1, created=2025-11-11T13:56:59]: Strange that it doesn’t mention which leads and how many leads have depression. False positives common for women. Though at your age your exercise tolerance is quite low.

I probably only made it to like 130 but I am also extremely sensitive to tachycardia (I am sensitive to tachycardia while having a tachy disorder it’s so stupid.) and I had go to the Er for a seizure like episode not a week before and they were absolutely not dealing with that. You being tested by a regular cardiologist or a POTS specialist, was this in office or out of office. If it was in office and it was a POTS specialist and they didn’t mention it it’s probably a normal result for those suspected of having POTS. If not then ekgs kinda be sus dude especially if you be moving, mine likes saying I had a myocardial infarction on and off. That second blood pressure though. Are you usually high or low? And how does it change when you rise? Pots can be classified into sub types and all them mix but one stands out and it’s Hyperadrenergic POTS cause it is linked to high blood pressure specifically systolic, more extreme tachycardia, anxiety, tremors, nausea, and migraine headaches. They also usually can’t handle non stimulant adhd medication, some depression medications, and some anxiety medications. On the other hand one non stimulant adhd drug treats it by doing the opposite literally of the rest of them, and that same medication is an anti-anxiety medication. It’s also a hypertensive drug and that’s what it’s prescribed for in hyper-POTS. Most people have mixed type unless hyper pots is actually secondary to another disease. A lot of things to explore with a suspected or confirmed POTS diagnosis and about non of the doctors will tell you. Like how too many signs of neuropathic POTS may be a sign to be tested for autoimmune disorders, or that some places say that being diagnosed at all with POTS is a reason to be tested for autoimmune disorders.
