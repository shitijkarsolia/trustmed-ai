===============================================================================

Firefighter. 32. 20% bmi. I’ve been diagnosed with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and thickening/enlargement of the ventricle. Blood is apparently being backflowed and not getting properly oxygenated, leaving me exhausted. My heart rate is very low 90/40, and I nearly faint every time I stand up. I have to wait weeks for a follow up and tests. What’s going on, and what can I do to treat this so I can get back to normal and not lose my job due to poor physical fitness performance? I used to run marathons.

This suggests a potential pathological condition like a cardiomyopathy or a valve issue. The key is to strictly follow up with your cardiologist for the specific tests they ordered. Until then, you must immediately stop all high-intensity training as it could be dangerous. Your job is at risk, but pushing now risks your health. The treatment depends entirely on the precise diagnosis, which could range from medication to a procedure. You need urgent medical attention at an emergency department rather than waiting for routine follow-up, because you could be at risk for severe complications. Tell them that you’re concerned my heart isn’t pumping properly and that I may have cardiomyopathy, and that I need urgent evaluation.
