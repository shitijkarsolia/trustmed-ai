===============================================================================

My EP appointment isn't until late January wondering if there's anything majorly concerning where I should try to move that up. I had episodes similar to this a few years ago, finally saw an EP and was put on 120mg of verapamil. Two weeks ago this started up again. Pharmacy switched me to a different manufacturer of verapamil about a month ago, not sure if related, probably not. Would appreciate any insight into what I'm experiencing.
