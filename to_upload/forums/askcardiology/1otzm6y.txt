Hello everyone. Sorry if this sounds like a rant but im curious what other peoples opinions are Over the past month ive had 4 episodes of my heart rate suddenly jumping to 200. After going to the hospital a couple times the electrophysiologist suggest a loop recorder, which based on my research, is a minor procedure with little to no pain at all. Unfortunately for me, my experience went as poorly as it could’ve. The first thing that happened was me having an allergic reaction to something. Maybe it was the numbing they used, I don’t know, but I felt my throat swell up and when the procedure was finished my heart rate was already at 200. I was yelling to the guys that im having an allergic reaction and my throat was steady swelling up, yet this seemed to have dumbfounded everyone. It’s like they actually couldn’t grasp someone having a severe allergic reaction since they were just looking at me confused on what to do. Im screaming for them to get me an epi pen and no one reacts, so I point to the epi pen I brought in (thank god I thought ahead) and used it myself since they were so incompetent. The next part was the worst, I suddenly started to feel severe pain in my chest in the area it was implanted. The pain at first was so bad I was screaming at the top of my lungs because I thought I was about to die. It’s been 5 hours, and the pain is still so unbearable I can’t breathe all the way in because it hurts so much. While im laying there screaming for help, again, it’s like these guys’ brains just stopped functioning. My heart rate continued to climb, I start sweating, and im screaming for help and these guys are just staring at me. The actual surgeon that did the procedure was also trash, he kept squeezing the area trying to figure out where it was even while I yelling at him to stop touching me, even trying to shove him off because he was hurting me so much. I’ve done a chest X-ray and he said that the loop recorder is in a normal location, but clearly there’s something wrong. The pain is so bad I was put on fentanyl and I am barely functioning still. Im very scared that something went wrong during my procedure and since no symptoms seem to be going away. Even my new current nurse said she’s seen this procedure done a thousand times and no one has reacted like I have. I guess my question is, what could they have done wrong? im just praying at this point I dont fall ill due to other peoples incompetence. Also im sorry if i sound like a karen, im never one to complain or say things under my breathe when i pass someone, but this whole situation just seems so unfair to me.
