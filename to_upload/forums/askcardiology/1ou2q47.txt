===============================================================================

I have been sent to the emergency room twice in the last week by medical professionals. My heart rate has been all over the place, just doing dishes the other day my heart rate spiked to 167 and I felt like I was going to pass out. The ER ruled out a heart attack and sent me on my way stating it wasn’t an emergency so there was nothing they could do. If I’m sitting down doing absolutely nothing, I’m fine besides the pressure in my chest. Even sitting eating/drinking/talking and I can feel my heart start to race again, usually sitting around 115. If I stand in one spot it’s around 130, but if I start walking or go up stairs it’s around 150. The ecg at the hospital showed tachycardia and short PR intervals, but otherwise everything else was normal. I’m only 29 years old. I’m not in the best shape ever, but I am a probation officer and a mom of two young kids so it’s also not like I sit around on my butt all day. However, this is really starting to mess with my quality of life and I’m really worried that I won’t get answers tomorrow and I’ll have to continue going through this.

That they haven't found an emergency in the hospital can be seen as a positive, even if symptoms are ringing your alarm bells. Secondly, your feelings are absolutely valid on the matter, it *is* a scary thing. Bring up to the cardiologist what you wrote in this post.

Not a doctor but pretty much everyone I’ve heard says that since cardiologists have such a high patient load it’s pretty typical for them not to spend a lot of time with patients especially if you have typical test results. The cardiologist I saw was in the room maybe five minutes and the one my mom saw she said was in there even less. It sucks, but if your cardiologist then refers out to nurse practitioners under them after the first or so many appointments they are usually significantly better about the whole talking to patients.
