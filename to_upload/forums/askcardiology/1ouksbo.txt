===============================================================================

36F history of HFrEF. Ejection Fraction has improved significantly to 55% but blood pressure has been uncontrolled since I was 19 and still uncontrolled which has lead to being diagnosed with CHF last year.. my question is why do my EKG’s always have new “infarcts”.. this time it’s an anterioseptal one or whatever but I’ve had other weird ones in the past. One was just septal infarct… there were other names I don’t remember but yea.. what does that mean and is it normal?
