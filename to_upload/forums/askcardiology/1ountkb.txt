Hi, F24, I've noticed that sometimes I move, change positions, and my heart suddenly gives one harder beat that I can certainly feel. I think I can also feel it if I breathe in too hard. It usually doesn't happen often, but today it happened multiple times, it's just one beat, sometimes two, that feels harder and then it goes away. Is it a concern?
