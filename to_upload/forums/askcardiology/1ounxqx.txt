===============================================================================

Pulmonology ordered a ct scan because I feel like I can barely breath doing anything more than a light walk. Could this be from my uncontrolled autoimmune issues? If not what could be a more likely cause? It’ll probably be awhile before I can actually see cardiology since I’m going to have to wait for a referral from pulmonology.
