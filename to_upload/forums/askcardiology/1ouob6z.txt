===============================================================================

39 yo Female, Type 1 diabetes for 27 years. I was diagnosed this year with BAV, moderate Aortic Stenosis, and a mildly dilated Ascending Aorta. I no longer do planks, pushups, wall sits, burpees, etc, (I do shoulder taps from a knee-push-up position instead) but continue with abdominal work like bicycles, scissor kicks, etc. Sometimes when doing these or also floor sprints (I keep them slower) I feel a pressure in my ears/neck, and my hearing gets muffled. I feel like it's always been this way so I'm not sure what's "normal" or not, but I'm concerned that when this happens I'm having an unsafe rise in blood pressure. My doctor says that these exercises should be fine, but I thought I'd see what others think while I wait on my appointment with her. Thank you.
