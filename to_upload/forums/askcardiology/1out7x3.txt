===============================================================================

I’ve been experiencing various cardiac symptoms over the last few months (shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, pre-syncope) and due to my family history of heart disease my cardiologist wanted me to wear the Zio monitor for a week. I just got my test results back, and there are several instances where the device indicates artifact but apparently I pressed the button to trigger an event immediately after. This is not always the case, but nearly every time this happens I reported either lightheadedness or palpitations. What criteria are used to determine if a detected rhythm is due to an artifact vs related to an actual abnormal rhythm? Is it possible that I actually *AM* experiencing some sort of heart issue and it written off as a machine issue? Thank you in advance!!

A cardiologist can review the raw tracings to confirm whether any true rhythm abnormalities were missed. Usually when you press the button, those segments are manually reviewed by a technician or cardiologist to see if a real rhythm change occurred, even if the device auto-labeled it as artifact.
