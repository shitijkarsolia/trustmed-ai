===============================================================================

First off, I have severe health anxiety. I’ve had it since I was probably 8 years old. Ironically, my first “worry” was related to a little boy (my age) dying suddenly due to a hole in his heart. I had an echo in 2009 (19 years old) that came back normal. I had another echo in 2017 (27 years old) that came back normal. I had another echo in 2019 (29 years old) that showed “mild right ventricular enlargement”. In 2017, I also had a nuclear scan and wore a holter monitor for 48 hours. Both of those were normal, but the holter monitor showed PVCs (but not enough to worry with). I’ve often worried about the mild right ventricular enlargement, but my doctor said it was nothing to be concerned with. Most of the testing I’ve had done was related to my HA, but I always thought it was chest pain, shortness of breath, or my heart skipping around. Sometimes the PVC’s last for 5-10 seconds, which I’ve read can be NSVT or VT. I’ve also had an EKG in the middle of a panic attack that showed sinus tachycardia, t-wave abnormality, and inferior myocardial infarction. The follow up EKG showed everything to be normal, as well as the labs. I say all of that to say this: I read where someone asked about ARVC. I had never heard of it (and now I wish I never did) but it has me convinced that it’s something I might have or my kids might get. I don’t have any family history of sudden death, but my mother has had mitral valve prolapse and skipped beats throughout her life. I say all of that to ask this: Is ARVC something I should be concerned with? Can anyone in the cardiac field provide peace of mind?

Anxiety can amplify normal heart sensations, making them feel dangerous, but your heart appears structurally and functionally normal. Seeing a therapist can really help break this cycle. Because your heart has been medically cleared, therapy can help shift your focus from What if something is wrong? to My heart is healthy, and anxiety is driving these sensations. This is key to preventing the loop from continuing. Not all therapists are familiar with health anxiety around the heart, and seeing someone who isn’t can actually make things worse, because they might unintentionally validate your fears instead of helping you manage them so find a therapist who understands cardiac conditions or at least knows when medical reassurance is sufficient.
