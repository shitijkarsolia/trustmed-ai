===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with NCLV 6 months to a year ago now and my doctor never really explained anything to me nor treated it (it was a John Hopkins hospital that is now no longer with them and charges 5k either a month or year to go to). Is it possible for anyone to describe what it is to me? Most of my doctors didn’t know it existed until I told them so I can’t ask them. If I had to say anything about it is that I believe it interferes with my day to day life (raising my heart rate, making me short of breath even with short walks, and I feel a tightness and pain in my chest if I work out or do sports. I’m also 17 if that helps with anything). I don’t know if it’s severe or not (I’m pretty sure it’s not) but from what I’ve seen on google, it can be pretty serious and deadly, not to mention I have a bunch of other pretty bad chronic illnesses. (Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this, I’ll remove it if so)
