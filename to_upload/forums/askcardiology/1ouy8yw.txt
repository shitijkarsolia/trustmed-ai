===============================================================================

my pcp told me it could be bc of the lead placement so it might be wrong but i feel like she was just saying that so i don’t worry too much. Also she kinda decided to order a chest xray after listening to my heart before i did the ecg so idk if i should worry about anything. ECG also said infereolateral lateral- ST elevation- repolarization variant 23F if that helps am i chillin or nah? i got an appt for cardio in a few months but idk what to do with this in the meantime

Even small placement errors can make the P wave look larger or change its shape, which can be misread as enlargement when the heart is actually normal.
