1. u/Impressive_Donut3122 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T08:11:28]: It shows mild heart abnormalities: mild weakness in pumping, mild thickening, and mild relaxation issue. Nothing severe, but it suggests some strain or early heart disease that should be monitored and managed. It mentions regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) in areas supplied by LAD and LCX arteries, suggesting reduced blood flow or old damage.
