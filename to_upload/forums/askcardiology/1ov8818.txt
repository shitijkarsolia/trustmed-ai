===============================================================================

these are all at least 6mths post (for concealed accessory pathway) ablations. I am still under cardiac EP team (London based) yearly checks and advice lines. Still experiencing on off several times a week arrhythmia with symptoms of SOB, pre syncope at times, dizziness at times, palpitations, skipped beats, sometimes chest pain or between scapula pains, just wondering if anyone can see any probs in these. normal structural heart on echo 76% EF, and CT angio last year all clear. Taking propranolol 10mg a day as needed to reduce due to side effects. thus lower dose is helping keeping my resting and walking heart rate down at least still tachycardia break outs.
