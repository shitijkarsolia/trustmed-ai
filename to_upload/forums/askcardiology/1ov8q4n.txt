Hi. I am a 49 year old male. I had an ablation done around 20 years ago as had a ventricular tachycardia. Since then I have had palpitations on and off so get this checked out every few years. I had some tests recently and all was ok, blood pressure was a little up, echocardiogram was ok. But slight thickening of heart wall which was noticed in my 20s as well. The doctor suggested I have an MRI as a precaution. To cut a long a long story short my MRI showed scarring on my heart. The doctor basically said I had a heart attack , which is something I am completely unaware of. He couldn’t tell me timing of it or much else. I’ve had a band of pain around my back and chest on and off over the years, but went to get this checked out a few times when it happened and was told it wasn’t heart related. I recently had a number of EKGs blood tests and nothing suggested a heart attack. Am am now going to have some tests done to check for heart decease etc. it’s lucky I had the MRI, I only got it because I am with private health in UK. I am in general good health so it’s all a bit strange. Was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this, being told they had a heart attack but being unaware of it, and no signs with medical checks or symptoms.

Also, scarring can come from other things too (old myocarditis, prior ablation), so the MRI pattern plus your history matters. What I’d do next: stick with the cardiology work-up, ask what the MRI’s “late gadolinium enhancement” pattern suggests, check risk factors hard (lipids, A1c, BP), and ask if you need a CT coronary angiogram or stress test. Depending on results, they may put you on prevention meds (e.g., statin ± aspirin), a monitor for palpitations, and a BP/fitness plan. Plenty of people discover old scar and do fine for decades—key is nailing risk factors and follow-up. You were smart to get the MRI. Keep pushing for clear answers and a plan.
