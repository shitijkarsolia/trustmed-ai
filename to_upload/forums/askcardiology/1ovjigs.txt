===============================================================================

Dx'ed with Diastolic HF (preserved ejection fraction), atrial fibrillation I've run out of refills on my metoprolol but my cardiologist hasn't gotten back to me, and I've used up my 3 day holdover from the pharmacy. It is painful but is it normal withdrawal and not necessarily an emergency? I sent a request to pcp's office hoping they can send a temporarily refill tonight. If I don't get it, can I stick it out and just monitor my vitals? I don't want to go to ER if it's not needed. I'm 26f and also congenital heart disease (healed atrial/vent defect), very minor leaky mitral (?) valve, asthma, arthritis, connective tissue disorder Thank you

Since you already have shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue, this is not normal withdrawal, it could mean your heart rhythm or rate is unstable. If you can’t get a refill tonight, go to urgent care or the ER for evaluation and a dose. They can safely restart the medication and monitor your rhythm. Don’t just monitor at home.
