Hello! Not asking for a diagnosis of course but just a direction I might research further (plus I fully plan to schedule a cardiology appointment soon, as I have a\[n unrelated\] surgery planned next year and want to know before then). I've had this happen over my life, not too frequently, and almost always when exercising. I believe two of my siblings have something similar. Symptoms: while exercising (and it most often starts if I start running or do a *sudden fast* motion), I might feel my heart suddenly change its pulse with a tiny flutter. It doesn't necessary get super fast-- in fact it usually only increases bpm a bit, I'm already exercising and its high-- but it might be described as switching from a ba-DUM ba-DUM to a more ba-ba-ba type pattern. After that, if I don't stop exercising it will stay like that, and eventually (e.g. if I am running a track race) I will feel myself get a bit weaker/slower, and one time I even had my vision drain black by the end (though didn't pass out, nor felt like I would). I have to stop moving to get it to end, and try to just calm it down. I discovered by myself what I eventually researched to be a 'vagal maneuver'-- if I go upside down (or at least put chest lower-down, hunched over), my heart might flutter for a second then restore itself to normal. Otherwise, deep calming breaths (even holding a deep breath for a few seconds) can make it flutter and restore. It happened most as a high school athlete, nowadays (age 32, still running but only casually) it might happen only every couple months (not going 'as hard', I guess). (Also, I occasionally feel a single heart flutter randomly, but it doesn't activate this 'mode' described above, and my normal heart rhythm is unchanged...) EDIT: I should add I just had an EKG for my PCP and nothing was noted as abnormal, so my heart is normal when not 'having this episode' thing go on. Can anyone point me to a couple terms or things I might research further?... Thanks very much!!

Not a doctor, but: if when you said it changes from ba-DUM to ba-ba-ba- you meant continually (not in like a 'triplet' of beats) - this sounds like SVT to me (this is only because I was recently diagnosed with it and have been researching it a lot). The rate will often feel a noticeable spike, which may even be masked by exercise I wonder? Mine will sometimes leap to 210-ish if it's exercise induced, or more commonly in the 180-190 range during an episode. The rhythm weakens a bit because it's inefficient, and feels like a less-pronounced continual beat instead of the usual two-part feel as you said. It's also super hard to catch on ECGs, I've had probably 6 of varying lengths in the last decade and only the most recent one caught it finally (when it's not happening, my ECGs appear totally normal). It can often begin and end pretty abruptly or with a fluttery PVC/PAC feeling beat. And, the fact that vagal maneuvers have worked for you is also a good indicator, I think. There are multiple subtypes of it and I have no idea what kind I have, but mine just sounds similar enough that it might be worth investigating! For people who don't find it furthers any health anxiety, I recently got the coolest wearable monitor (second hand on ebay) that will record all day with just two electrode stickers &amp; the small device worn, then run it all through an AI program &amp; spit out a report - the AI is pretty good, too. I wanted to know how often it was actually happening for me before scheduling an ablation, and the thing has been amazing for it! If you're interested I can link it; I only hesitate posting it all the time as a suggestion because it can catch a ton of artifact and harmless junk that *looks* scary if you aren't familiar and could worsen the worry. But, if every ECG you schedule lands on a day when it doesn't happen, it could be useful to send (even though I'm sure "look at this ECG I took at home" is not their favorite thing to hear). Hope you can figure it out!
