===============================================================================

I have been having increasing cardiac symptoms over the last few months including a couple of episodes where shortness of breath and chest pain sent me to the ER. I've had all the tests now -- two week holter, echo, and treadmill with echo -- and the only thing they turned up was 1.7% SVE. So not, as I understand it, clinically significant, but I really feel it. I can ignore the chest pain but I'm often exhausted by the end of the day and I've had to slow down a lot. I'm sleeping 10 hours a day, instead of 8, walking more slowly, and skipping my physical therapy exercises. When I do more, I have more episodes and feel like crap. I'm wondering if my fibromyalgia is making me more sensitive to the SVE? Or if it has something to do with my POTS? I'm not particularly anxious -- minor stressors that I manage pretty well -- and this is actually not making me especially anxious, mostly just disappointed that I don't feel like I can be as active as I'd like to be.
