===============================================================================

I was on Seroquel for three years. Then went off on it. Recently had a full cardiac work up for other reasons (48 hours Holter followed by two week Holter, BNP, troponin a few times, echocardiogram chest x-ray) I got diagnosed with POTs by my cardiologist My QTc averages about 430. Do I have any risk with my pots? I started off at a low dose tonight of 12.5 mg. Any knowledge is appreciated!
