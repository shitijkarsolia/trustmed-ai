Hi all! 28F I know I’m late to this and you all have seen many upon many of these posts, but I’d like to see what you think. I’ve been suffering from heart palpitations for about a month now. Had to go to the ER when they first appeared and was placed on a Holter monitor for a week. ED thinks it’s caffeine related, but since I cut all caffeine out, there has been no improvement. I saw a cardiologist who did an EKG and saw frequent PVCs. This was before the holter results came in. Had an Echocardiogram done and everything came out normal. I see an EP in a few days, but I thought I share my Holter results here to see what y’all think and if I should be concerned.
