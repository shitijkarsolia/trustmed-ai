===============================================================================

I’m having a very hard time with the decision of whether my 10 year old daughter should have an ablation for her SVT. Her first episode was about 5 months ago at a sports competition (lots of anxiety + physical activity). We didn’t know about vagal maneuvers or anything at the time. Long story short, she was in SVT for 3 hours and given 2 doses of adenosine in the ER. She had 2 more episodes within a month of the first. One lasted for 5 minutes and vagal maneuvers worked. Second lasted about 45 minutes and resolved on its own on the way to the ER. She had a normal echo and cardiologist confirmed she does not have the WPW pattern on her EKG. After the repeated episode, I scheduled the ablation, which is next week. Since then, she has had no episodes or symptoms for close to 3 months, despite being very active and in competitive sports. The first hospital visit with adenosine was pretty traumatic and I do not want her to experience it again. However, I’m worried about the risks of the ablation too including possibly causing more rhythm problems or symptoms like PVCs chest pain etc, on top of the scarier risks to think about (which I realize are very rare - but this is my kid so even a 0.0001% chance still feels scary) It’s been a quiet 3 months which makes me wonder if this is the best decision right now, especially at such a young age. I know nobody can make this decision but us but I’m wondering if anyone can share their experiences with childhood SVT and/or thoughts on this? I know SVT won’t just go away but she’s doing so well and I don’t know I should try to “fix something that isn’t broken”. Maybe she would handle it better physically and mentally when she’s a few years older? (Although she has pretty much zero anxiety over the procedure - that’s all me lol) I’m terrified to make the wrong decision either way I go.😭

My blood pressure is in my flair. Does she happen to have blood pressure issues of any sort? I've never been ablated per se but it's very safe and effective (95 percent success rate). In rare cases it can recur like once or twice. After the procedure she may experience changes in bowels very temporarily, as expected.

3. u/Subject_Bumblebee645 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T03:49:51]: I'm not a professional and this is just my opinion. I would not get the ablation. SVT is rarely dangerous and she's so young. If no episodes happen, maybe wait until she's a teenager atleast so the decision wouldn't be solely on your shoulders. Any medical procedure should be carefully considered. I personally have had SVT and i needed adenosine and 2 doses of metoprolol. Started managing stress and haven't gotten it since. No ablation needed for me atleast.

5. u/HopefulKiwi [score=1, created=2025-11-13T13:53:10]: I’ve had an ablation for SVT, I’m older (39) but if the cardiologist is recommending it I would have no hesitation doing it. The process was simple and the risk is very low.
6. u/Depressedaxolotls [score=1, created=2025-11-13T15:58:18]: Not a doctor, but I had an ablation for SVT when I was ~14. I also have WPW. Before my ablation, I would go weeks to months without an incident. The procedure itself was super easy, I went home the same day and just took it easy for a day or two. I haven’t had an incident since! I would listen to the doctor, or get a second opinion if you really aren’t sure.
7. u/Individual_Ad3796 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T20:40:18]: Thanks everyone for your input. Today, she had an episode and had to receive adenosine again. So, we got our clarification and going through with the procedure next week. It sucks but I’m glad it happened now vs after I cancelled it. Hopefully we can put this all in the past after the ablation. Fingers crossed.
