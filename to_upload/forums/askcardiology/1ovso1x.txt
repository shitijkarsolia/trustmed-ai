===============================================================================

So I am a 36F and I am pretty active but lately I have been having a weird chest ache that comes and goes for a couple days now. My stress level is pretty high and I am worried that I am actually going to have a heart attack. I am scared the stress is catching up to me. I have been experiencing bad stomach aches and extreme fatigue. What would you do? I just had my last myannt 8 day monitor last month because I had an ablation back in 2023 and they said everything looked normal.
