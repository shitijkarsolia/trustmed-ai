hello! i’m a 24f who has been having left side chest pain, high BP, and shortness of breath for \~2 weeks. had an abnormal chest x-ray and my PCP and they sent me to the ER. at the ER they did another x-ray and and EKG, and i was told my EKG was perfect and sent home with a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection. i’m sitting at home a few hours later and they finally upload my EKG results to my chart - does everything look normal here? i’m confused by “nonspecific ST and T wave abnormality” and “abnormal ECG” when at the ER they told me everything was good. TIA!
