Two weeks ago i coughed and suddenly my bp spiked my HR spiked chest pain dizzy lightheaded. Troponin went up to 9 then down. Called ambulance hospital said -&gt;dehydrated. Two days later different hospital admitted for observation had an episode they treated with valsalva and metropolol diagnosed as SVT. Kept having a lot of spikes in HR the following days 10+a day then was put on propranolol 60mg ER small spikes (no higher than 120) kept happening then days later no episodes for 2 days followed by an event 2 days ago where my bp rose to 151/105 and Heartrate of 73 ???? I double checked this my cardiologist had me do a stress test and Coronary CTA all came back clear. Awaiting zio patch results that captured another event but not this last one but i thought SVT the heartrate has to be high so what was this last event then???could it have been kept in check by propranolol?? I was at the ER and same thing happened but i was not on the monitor at the time it felt bad once it started getting better they started monitoring it did read : NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM NORMAL ECG WHEN COMPARED WITH ECG OF 12-NOV-2025 12:18, THE AXIS SHIFTED LEFT T WAVE INVERSION NOW EVIDENT IN INFERIOR LEADS-&gt; this was after physician review not the automated text on the paper All labs my cardiologist ordered came back normal thyroid lipids etc. Any thoughts? I am desperate and scared and terrified Asides from all this I have some gallbladder stones and sludge i am 5m postpartum breastfeeding no other issues
