===============================================================================

I recently saw my cardiologist (about 2 weeks ago) who changed my medication from nebivolol to Half Securon SR to try and reduce the symptoms I feel with palpitations etc, I have mainly been feeling single beats but have a history of nsvt and family history of heart issues. I have been having very strange sleeping patterns/hours and decided to get up and try to sleep later. I suddenly had a bit of a funny feeling and did my ecg on my watch as usual and it was a bit all over the place. I sat and didn’t another one shortly afterwards which was better. I assume this is just down to the fact of my body adjusting to a new medication as I have been feeling quite a few more palpitations this week anyway. I have attached the 2 ecgs I did on my watch and would appreciate any thoughts anyone might have.
