===============================================================================

The issues of my heart are apparently quite complicated but for a short version, I originally had a mobitz type 1, wencheblock. Upon the birth of my son I went into complete heart block which has since gone away. I do have SVTs, about 8% and PVCs . My resting HR is usually in the 60a now that the CHB has gone away. I have currently come down with a virus or infection of some sort and my resting HR is now 110, and has been in the 100s for the last 12 hours. Given my known conditions and the uncertainty of everything, is this a cause for concern? Or just the body fighting infection? Please know I realize my shortened scenario does sound odd as I’ve been told it’s very rare for CHB to just go away. This has been confirmed with numerous monitoring sessions and EKG’s.
