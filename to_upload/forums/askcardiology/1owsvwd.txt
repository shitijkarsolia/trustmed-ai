Hi All, I feel bad for evening asking because I know my issues aren't nearly as bad as many out there. I have this funny irregular heart beat feeling and I can feel my heart beating when lying down. It's not consistent but happens a few times per day. I would say an annoyance of 2/10 though I am completely hyper focused on this and can't seem to think of anything else. I had this for about 2 months and it actually went away for 2 weeks (whilst I had the flu) but today and yesterday is now back. I have had an echocardiogram and that was healthy. In fact the doctor mentioned how "impressive" my heart was. I then did a three day holter monitor. This showed a isolated benign "?AFlutter" at 0.03% burden and at a max bpm of 69. I am 25 years old, very active, running and gym every few days. No family history, no smoking, no drinking and healthy weight. I also had my bloods taken and everything was healthy including high-sensitivity troponin I result was **&lt;5 ng/L.** I don't have any other symptoms apart from the occasional air hunger. None of my symptoms are made worst with movement and actually I can feel the most when i'm at rest. I know it's not as bad as others and im sorry, I am just very worried and hoping for someone to shed some light on my case. Thanks so much
