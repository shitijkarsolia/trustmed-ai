So i’ve been dealing with something weird for almost a year now and I honestly don’t know what to do to get rid of it, i get this strange spasm-like feeling in the heart/chest area it’s not painful, but it’s definitely uncomfortable and worrying it feels like a straight line of spasms starting from the front of my chest and going to my back, almost symmetrically. It comes and goes randomly I’ve seen two doctors already one general practitioner and one gastro specialist both did an exam, used the ultrasound machine, checked everything, and told me i was totally fine they both basically said it’s probably stress or anxiety, and to be fair… I do stress a lot because of work and life. But this sensation hasn’t gone away and it’s affecting my peace of mind, it also happens more when i come back home after work, did anyone experience smth similar ?
