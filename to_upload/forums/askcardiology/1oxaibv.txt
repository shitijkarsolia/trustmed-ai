===============================================================================

Hi all, I'm short, mid 40s and have been following up on a slightly elevated heart rate that weirdly got flagged (I always felt I was slightly high but couldn't prove it) when I went in for a possible stomach ulcer. Only family history my mother got flagged for atrial flutter unexpectedly a couple of years ago and that got dealt with. In short - ECG this May. 12 lead. Normal sinus rhythm but I averaged approx. 105 the whole time and was like I'd like to follow up on this please. Holter in September. Result in October; 55% Tachycardic over 23 hours, with a normal sinus rhythm and Blood Pressure (which I didn't know you could get from a Holter). This has been referred back to my local Cardiology unit &amp; I now have an appointment with them. Had to see my GP today about something (stack off odds symptoms this year, discomfort around my left eye which I have a stigmatism in + PEDS) &amp; my sinus area. I asked whilst I was there if they had more details about my Holter. Low of 65bpm, high of 150bpm with no symptoms, normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure throughout and an average of 102bpm (which I thought wasn't bad as its only slightly high but then thought I was supposed to be asleep for some of it - had a really bad night's sleep with it on though so didn't actually get much). Does this actually tell me anything more? - I'd imagine it doesn't and I'm just going to have to wait for my Cardiology appointment?
