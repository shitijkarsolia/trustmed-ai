===============================================================================

I took this ecg while at rest and calm so basically should be my baseline ecg. Ive been learning how to read them and teaching myself. Does it mean anything that it seems like the t waves dip below the baseline at the end then that baseline goes back up towards the p wave? I cant find anything that tells you what this could mean? Any help or advice would be appreciated or where is best to learn these things? Also do3s the rest look ok? It does to me but im no where near a medical professional just teaching myself 😅
