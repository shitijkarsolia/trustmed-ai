===============================================================================

Hi there, I’m only 2 days into wearing this (scheduled for 2 weeks) and I can’t lay down without my breasts completely squishing the device and causing quite a bit of discomfort. Beyond that, the actual adhesive (not the surrounding, but the strip on the device that goes down) is not just itchy but stinging. My question is this… what are my options? It’s obviously the weekend now, so I doubt my cardiologist will get back to me until Monday. I really need these results, but I’ve had multiple symptoms recorded in the 2 days already. I’ve also seen placement horizontal on the upper chest, and I’m not sure why that wasn’t an option for me. I’ve done a holter monitor before and it was the lanyard/electrode kind with no issue. I welcome any input, including “suck it up for two weeks.” Thank you!
