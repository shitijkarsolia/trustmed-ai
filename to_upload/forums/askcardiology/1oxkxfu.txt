Sometimes its associated with some pressure or some pain in the surrounding area. I saw a cardiologist and he ordered an ultrasound and CT of my head/neck and chest which isn't scheduled until next week because they needed to do a prior authorization first. He said that he had only ever seen this (horizontal) once before and he was concerned for possible SVC syndrome or muscle compression of SVC. Today I feel a little lump under my left posterior jaw maybe 1-2cm in size. I am concerned it could be either a swollen lymph node or a blood clot. No fever or cough. My tests are next week and follow up is early December. Can this really wait this long? What are some signs I should be concerned about or thoughts in general about what could cause this? Thanks!

If they see anything on your EKG, they will definitely admit you. That's what happened to me, and I didn't even go to the ER for my heart. I didn't even recognize how serious it was until later. I went because my stomach was in so much pain. I knew I had bradycardia and had been dealing with it for a few years. I had just seen my cardiologist, was scheduled for an ablation, and was prescribed blood thinners because of atrial flutter. However, when the ER doctor saw my EKG, I was admitted, kept overnight, and had surgery on Monday.

In adults, the most common cause (of SVC syndrome) is compression of the vein by a tumor in the chest, such as lung cancer or lymphoma. I’m not trying to scare you. Malignant tumors are responsible for up to 70% of SVC syndrome cases.
