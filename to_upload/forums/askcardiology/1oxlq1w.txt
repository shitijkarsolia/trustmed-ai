===============================================================================

5 Images. Heart rate is 66. I'm a fairly large 41-year-old male. I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I've always had random palpitations like these, but I've noticed they have been happening much more lately in the last few months. 1000 - 2000 per day, I would say. There are times when I will get maybe only a hundred or so a day for like a month. Then a bad stretch. No other symptoms. Good stress ECG and ECHO 5 months ago. No known heart issues. Just mild high blood pressure that is basically controlled now with 40mg. I was able to catch a few of these palpitations on this KARDIA test. Usually, I get 1 to 3 a minute, mostly when resting when my heart rate is low. Don't really feel anything when up walking around. So basically, I was just looking for some advice on this result on my 6 LEAD Kardia device. Any other concerning issues you can spot? Otherwise looks ok? Thank you.
