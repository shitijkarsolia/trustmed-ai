M 28 Indian BMI 35 So since last 3 months I am under stress and sometimes my anxiety spikes, My chest tightens and a I Feel a pain (quite easy to localise) so as said Chest pain should always be addressed so I got an ECG done (two days ago) and it returned normal result and Got my lipid profile Thyroid Diabetes screening electrolytes everything came back normal and that eased up my anxiety but today when I was studying I experienced sudden squeezing pain on my Right chest lateral side (anterior to mid axillary line) it was there for 2 minutes and I stretched my arm and the pain reduced a bit but returned again then I stood up and the pain was subsided BUT again returned when I sat so I had to stand again but this time pain was settled down (pain is completely gone but my right arm feel little sore). So should I consider getting other investigations done? My HR is always around 90-100 and BP is quite normal and My GP has prescribed me Propranolol I have a bad posture and due to my exam I have to sit for long hours could that be a reason for it?
