Hi. Recently, I have had squeezing pains in the chest and jugular area, as well as sudden confusion spells that last for only a few seconds. The squeezing and rapid onset of confusion happens after exertion. 33 male. Went to er. Told it was chest pain unspecified, no catscan. Troponin was minimal They checked it twice. Thrombocytosis, they noticed as well. Primary and my endocrinologist say anxiety. Endo did say platelet count is high at 530. A Hemotologist at a hospital for platelet count of 530 says blood clot and needs catscan for the sudden onset of confusion, squeezing at heart area and jugular area. He said I needed to go to ER, but the thing is, no one escorted me to the er. He wanted me to walk over on my own, unsupervised. If they let me walk over on my own, it must not be an emergency. I saw him at a hospital, which is a few minutes' walk to er. Why would he let me go on my own with symptoms such as trouble walking, sudden confusion spells, jugular area squeezing, and chest pain. Also wants an abdominal ultrasound ? Primary care prescribed beta blockers for anxiety. Only 10 day supply. I heard it's dangerous to suddenly have to stop them. Bottle says 10mg 3x day. 10 day supply. I also asked my primary if he could order a catscan outside the er, as it would be way cheaper, but I dont think he'll do it. He doesn't see a need for me to go to er, and I know he won't want me to do a catscan. Im afraid to go to er. They'll likely just say it's anxiety, too. I'll be on the hook for thousands just for people to say "it's anxiety." Endo says say 530 platelet count is high, er doc primary and hemotologist says it's not. Then why did they put thrombocytosis on discharge papers for er. I can't stand this anymore. Edit: I wanted to add, my upstairs neighbors would terrorize me and my nervous system by jumping up and down on the floor as a form of harassment for calling the police on them for loud music 130am on a Monday night. They proceeded to stomp the floor so hard they would put cracks in the ceiling. They would stomp at random very frequently for months on end. It really terrorized my nervous system. I've already seen psychiatrists and therapists. My psych says I have hypervigilance. Edit 2: I have watched people die countless times, also making my heart rate climb. Seeing so many family members lying dead on a hospital bed. I never felt the same, and Im talking physically, seeing my mom passed away on a hospital bed. Already on meds and psych and therapy. They dont treat physical things. Is this dysautomia?/pots ? My heart rate gets high doing the simplest things. Im very active and ride a bike alot too, but stopped because of scary symptoms listed at top. I think my heart got too used to beating so much it's like stuck if you will.
