===============================================================================

I often struggle with episodes of accelerated sinus rhythm. For example, when I lift something or do even mild physical activity, my heart rate can suddenly jump to around 150+ bpm. I immediately get warm and start sweating, even though the effort is minimal. I also sometimes get these episodes out of nowhere. My heart rate then stays elevated for a while, sometimes around 100 bpm, sometimes 130–150 bpm even when I’m just resting. I also run regularly and try to maintain an easy, steady pace, but my heart rate often climbs higher anyway, even though the effort feels light. Afterward, it can stay high for a long time, even if I’m not out of breath at all. I’ve had multiple tests done by a cardiologist (Holter, stress test, echocardiogram). They concluded that I have SVT and elevated sinus rhythm. I tried verapamil but stopped because of side effects. My cardiologist mentioned catheter ablation as an option, but I barely suffer from SVT since it’s only occasional. My main problem is these frequent episodes of (presumably) elevated sinus rhythm, and medications tend to give me side effects. Are there other options I should consider, or what would be the smartest next step in this situation?
