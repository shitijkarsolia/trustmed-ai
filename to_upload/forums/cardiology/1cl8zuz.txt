===============================================================================

Hey everyone, I’ll be starting my IM internship next month, and I’m interested in cardiology. I would love to hear any advice on how you think I should go about learning EKGs? I was thinking of getting Dubins, but I wanted to hear some other perspectives before making a purchase. Thanks so much for your time!

My recommendation is a Goldberger's Clinical Electrocardiography. Marriott's is also excellent and more detailed (than Goldberger's), but it's graphic design is old-fashioned. I guess it's for cardio fellows.

If you really want to go into Electrophysiology and Arrhythmology, then I recommend Clinical Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology. A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease. If you want to specialize in Ischemic ECG then ECG in Acute MI by Stephen Smith is great.

Also, practicing with real cases can be super helpful. Check out Dreambound for some good resources and courses that could help you dive deeper into EKGs. You can find more info here: [https://dreambound.com/blog/how-to-become-an-ekg-technician](https://dreambound.com/blog/how-to-become-an-ekg-technician) and [https://dreambound.com/blog/ekg-classes-near-me](https://dreambound.com/blog/ekg-classes-near-me). Good luck with your internship!

No one is going to appreciate the intern talking about the electrical axis but they will appreciate the one who picks up heart block and can appropriately respond to the patient with “new onset afib” correctly
