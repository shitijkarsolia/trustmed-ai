Hey guys! I watched a medical lecture while cleaning yesterday over Tetralogy of Fallot, and the instructor made a really interesting point that I never really thought of. TOF is really one actual defect, a misalignment of the conal septum with the rest of the ventricular septum. The rest of the associated defects (overriding aorta, hypertrophic RV, pulmonary stenosis) follow that defect. What do you guys think about that??
