===============================================================================

Hi all, I'm an incoming USMD PGY1 who had the good fortune to match at a "big 4" IM program. I have a strong clinical interest in cardiology and recognize that my residency reputation will be a big help in getting me into fellowship. While I enjoy an academic atmosphere, I want to either pursue private practice or clinical-only academic medicine down the line. When it comes to matching into cards, I recognize some research is necessary, but honestly I have low intrinsic desire to pursue it. I have a non-traditional background with prior business experience + research in econ/policy. I have no clinical or translational research experience nor a desire to explore it more than I have to. My question is this: how little research can I get away with during residency if my goal is to match at clinically strong (but not necessarily research-focused) fellowship program while coming from a big-name residency? If I do pursue research, would cards programs be intrigued by my (not at at cards-related) health econ research?

IMO you should have something current to at least put down on your resume and talk about during interviews to at least give the illusion you care about that stuff. Many of us really don't, even in big name programs and fellowship, but it's part of the game. Give yourself the best chance of success to at least have options later down the road. Get involved with something cardiac related preferably. Hard to say if some general econ/policy is good enough, but I've had friends match into other specialties with that background. It really doesn't take much and you probably won't have to grind at it like some others. Just connect with an attending or fellow and tag along with whatever they're doing. Producing something legitimate during 2yrs of fellowship is somewhat unrealistic anyway.

Just play the academic card for a couple more years. I would just get involved with something cardiology related. Your IM name will carry you but you still have to at least check the box.

4. u/docmahi [score=3, created=2024-06-06T13:05:25]: I have no idea what a big 4 IM is - i'll just assume its a top 4 program so a John's hopkins, harvard etc.. honestly with that big of a name you can match at a mid tier university program probably with minimal research. Also I know people would definitely like hearing your story of non-medical background. Should you do some research? probably will just expand your match possibilities plus it helps build bridges at your home program which I am guess has a great cards fellowship. Will you match without it? Yes you will - with a big name program like that you will get plenty of interviews and match somewhere.
5. u/buffnfurious [score=2, created=2024-06-06T11:56:48]: I did not do any research (not a single picogram) in residency and ended up at one of the hyper-competitive top cardiology programs and received interviews at almost every top program (minus Duke). Some of the notoriously research heavy programs were actually very interested and there was one interviewer who called my application “refreshing to see”. So it is possible but by no means without risk. Early during residency, I made myself a promise that I didn’t care where I ended up and that I’d rather be who I truly am because that’s my personality similar to you. I also weirdly wanted to test my hypothesis about it being possible. Furthermore, I knew that coming from a top IM program and with a humble but practical sense that I was one of the top clinical performers in my IM program, I would match somewhere if I applied broadly. I also notably had very unique scholarship that was not research that essentially no other applicant could possibly have so that is probably what helped open doors at the research heavy programs despite it not being anything close to research. I have a couple of friends at top fellowships who did not do research either and had some interesting pursuits. However, without any type of scholarly work or strikingly unique work, it would be practically impossible to match at a top program. Again, it is possible but you have to align all your cards perfectly and is not a path I’d recommend unless you are fine matching anywhere. I do admire your character and integrity but honestly even from an extreme example of no research like myself, I wouldn’t judge if you did a bit to get where you wanted to get. Feel free to DM me.
6. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2024-06-06T23:01:00]: I think you are missing the point of "research" and should adjust your attitude. - The vast majority of us, even those of us that train at big-deal programs, end up doing clinical cardiology (not research). Your end-goal is the norm, not an exception. - The purpose of doing research is not typically to lead to a career of research. The idea is to participate in the creative and scientific process and to demonstrate some sort of passion, interest or commitment beyond being "just a good resident who does well on tests". - For most cardiologist, the years in training are the last time that research is a significant thing. It's a good thing to embrace as an experience which will add perspective to your life and clinical practice, even if (like most of us) you don't continue to do research. - "Research" absolutely does NOT need to be bench, translational or clinical. In fact, it should not be one of these if you are not interested in them. If you are interested in health econ, that is an excellent thing to do a project in. Outcomes research, education research, etc. are also valuable. All the better if you can peripherally involve cardiology (which is easy, because cardiovascular outcomes--MI, stroke, death, etc.--are common and are excellent end-points for an analysis). When I interview fellow applicants (for a highly-ranked cardiology program) I want to see that they are (1) excited about cardiology, (2) creative/inquisitive and (3) hard-working/dedicated. What they invest in informs on this. I'm not passionate or knowledgeable about health econ but I would love to interview someone who is and invite them to our program. - I am not sure what a "big 4" IM program is (what is it?). However, if you are at a top-ranked IM program and do reasonably well, you will probably have no problem matching into a cardiology program *somewhere*. If you want to choose where that *somewhere* is, put in the effort.
