===============================================================================

Currently studying the topic and came across this correlation. Tried searching on Google but couldn't find anything, the closest thing i could find was just stating the fact in another way," delayed ventricle contraction leads to soft s1" , but why is soft s1 heard here? Is it because there is longer for ventricular filling to occur as systole is delayed, resulting in the valves being closer to a closed position, hence not travelling a lot during ventricular contraction, which leads to a soft s1?
