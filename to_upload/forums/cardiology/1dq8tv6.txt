Hello there. I am a paramedic and frequently encounter situations where diagnosed NSTEMI patients are transferred from a rural ED or smaller hospital without cardiology to a hospital that does have cardiology but no cath lab. Typically cardiology has been consulted, their orders have been initiated, and the patient is being transferred to their hospital to be admitted under them. My understanding is that these patients will typically, eventually, undergo angiography, which will require interfacility transfer to and from the cath-capable site. I am wondering if you can enlighten me about the benefits of being admitted directly to a cardiologist vs remaining in the smaller hospital under FM or IM + tele cardiology consults, considering there is no cath capability at either site. I am in Canada, in case that makes a difference.

I will say though that a lot of patients transferred as nstemi are just type II mi who rarely need an inpatient cath and perhaps the cost savings of bringing these patients to a lower acquity center outweighs the risk of needing to retransfer in the case you mistriage them and they end up neeeing a cath.

Any NSTEMI who is sick/high-risk enough to need an on site cardiologist really ought to have access to a cath lab. The only things I can think of are… - The hospital is super rural. Getting to a place with a telemetry ward, a full pharmacy and a helicopter pad may be useful. - This is some quirk of the Canadian health system that I don’t understand. I either case, I imagine that they are going to these non-cath-capable hospitals because a higher level-of-care hospital is not an option for some reason. Otherwise it’s foolish.

One of the primary advantages is the immediate access to specialized cardiology care. Cardiologists have more expertise in managing complex cardiac conditions, which can lead to more accurate diagnoses, more effective treatment plans, and better overall patient outcomes. When a patient is admitted directly under a cardiologist's care, they benefit from continuous monitoring and management by a specialist who can quickly respond to changes in their condition. Additionally, being admitted to a cardiology unit in a larger hospital often means access to more advanced diagnostic tools and a broader range of medications and therapies tailored specifically for cardiac patients. This specialized environment is typically better equipped to handle complications or emergencies that might arise, ensuring that patients receive prompt and appropriate interventions. This level of care can be critical in stabilizing patients and preparing them for eventual angiography or other advanced procedures. In contrast, remaining in a smaller hospital under the care of a family medicine (FM) or internal medicine (IM) doctor with telecardiology consults may not provide the same level of specialized attention. While telecardiology can offer valuable guidance, it lacks the immediacy and direct involvement of an on-site cardiologist. The FM or IM doctor might not have the same depth of experience in managing acute cardiac conditions, potentially leading to delays in recognizing and addressing complications. Furthermore, smaller hospitals may have limited resources and less experience with complex cardiac cases, which can impact the quality of care. In Canada, where the healthcare system emphasizes coordinated and specialized care, transferring NSTEMI patients to a hospital with a cardiology unit aligns with best practices for ensuring comprehensive cardiac care. This approach not only optimizes the immediate management of the patient's condition but also facilitates smoother coordination for any necessary interfacility transfers for procedures like angiography. The continuity of care under a cardiologist ensures that all aspects of the patient's cardiac health are addressed systematically, reducing the risk of adverse outcomes and improving the overall quality of care. In summary, the benefits of transferring NSTEMI patients to a hospital with cardiology services, even without a cath lab, include specialized care, access to advanced diagnostics and treatments, and better preparation for potential procedures. This specialized care model enhances patient outcomes compared to staying in a smaller hospital with only telecardiology support.
