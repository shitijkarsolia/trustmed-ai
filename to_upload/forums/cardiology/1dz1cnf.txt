Title: In a CAVB with VVi, why dont we see P waves all around on the EKG? Does the pacmaker inhibit them?

1. u/Cornballer [score=5, created=2024-07-09T10:08:38]: Could be afib. In sinusrythm you should be seeing them allover unless there is retrograde conduction from the ventricle. In that case look for it in the t wave. There could be some level of isorythmia where the frequency in the atria matches with the lower rate of the single chamber pacemaker causing the P to hide out in the QRS.
2. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2024-09-17T01:24:24]: To answer the question if you just have ventricular pacing in complete block then yes the p waves should be present. But why would you have a VVI rather than DDD when the patient is not in AFib?
