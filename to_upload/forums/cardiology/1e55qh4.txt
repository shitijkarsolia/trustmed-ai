===============================================================================

Im a 4th year medical student deciding whether to apply IM (then specialize in cards) or apply to rads. Cardiology was one of the only rotations that I truly enjoyed and could see myself doing. I would love to become a cardiologist. I am kind of terrified of not matching cardiology and getting stuck in IM. I personally do not think I would like that at all and i know how competitive cardiology is. It will also be a very long journey and i am curious to know the future outlook of cardiology. That being said i have been intrigued by radiology but during the rotation i was bored out of my mind. However, I think I am just drawn to the lifestyle aspect of radiology and how relaxed the residents seem to be compared to IM, surg, ect. Its also appealing to me because of the high pay obviously lol. I guess I am just looking for advice or wise words to sway me one way or another. What do you guys think I should do? TIA

To be fair, i like cardiology more however you said “getting stuck in IM”. I think thats a red flag for one reason… you could and youd be miserable. Also im general, reapplying for fellowship in 2-3 years sucks so hard. As a M4, you dont think that but as training progresses, the grind while working is a big pain in the ass.

Why don't you want to get stuck in IM? What don't you like about it? What do you like about cardiology? Cardiology's future is fine. Do you want to see patients (for better or worse) or look at images all day? Cardiology isn't necessarily a poor lifestyle at all and I certainly wouldn't make a career decision based on a perception of residents at a specific program.

I’m obviously biased (I’m IC) but I think cards gives a ridiculous variety and I love it Your chances to match are much worse for lower tier IM programs especially community - definitely doable but much harder
4. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2024-07-21T04:05:04]: If you like the lifestyle of radiology, do radiology. Cardiology is not a lifestyle specialty.
5. u/D-ball_and_T [score=1, created=2024-08-18T14:11:20]: I’m an IM rads prelim intern, once in rads you’re done. No more grinding, can focus on life. I see my co interns going for cards absolutely grinding. And the attending lifestyle is more or less the same. Both good fields, both can titrate up or down their work for more $, both can do procedures. One will be more clinically based and the other more (all really) imaging based Also, some radiologists will complain about the cognitive load etc, they would get absolutely destroyed in cardiology, radiology is an easier field as well
