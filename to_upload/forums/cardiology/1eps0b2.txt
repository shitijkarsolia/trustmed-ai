===============================================================================

Hello everyone, I would love to get your opinion on my job numbers. I am signing up for non invasive cards jon in northeast, very close to big city. Work includes outpatient, echo, stress, and inpatient rounding. Comp - 430 base( 7k RVU), then 55 per RVU. I have a conversation with lawyer, he believes it's relatively low. Any thoughts are really appreciated.

2. u/shahtavacko [score=3, created=2024-08-11T16:40:19]: I don’t know for sure, but presuming that the cost of living is higher there than it is here in Houston; the offer is a bit on the low side. Where I work we just got increased to 65 per rvu, the presumed production is 7585, 493k base. I am invasive but the noninvasive guys are not much lower (I think maybe 63).
3. u/jiklkfd578 [score=3, created=2024-08-11T23:07:27]: Of course that’s low. Quick glance at any MGMA or AGMA data will show that. You’re probably in the 25-35% range. On an RVU scale, $65 is about 50%.. I believe $55 would be 25% range. But total comp obviously depends if it’s an rvu mill or if you’re grinding to hit 50% production But if that’s the market you want to be in then it’s all about what the local offers look like. If you don’t have any others than it is what it is. Even if you do have other offers there is likely collusion so it’ll likely be pretty similar. Regardless, even if you tell them it’s low you’re likely not getting any huge increase. If you really don’t have to be in that particular area then you likely can get 100-200k more pretty easily. Our non-invasive guys in an employed mid size metro area are at 700k (salary plus quality) day 1. I think anything less than 600-650k total package plus benefits and you’re getting screwed personally. But again, it depends on how many rvus you’re expected to hit and how easy it is to grind out rvus (not all rvus are created equally)

5. u/maker879 [score=1, created=2024-08-12T17:07:55]: Need some more information. Close to which big city? And how close? Are you joining a private practice or a health system? Your numbers are the norm for Westchester, Long Island and North Jersey
6. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=1, created=2024-08-14T00:13:23]: I find it strange how often $/RVU go down (in this case $61 to $55) after hitting a benchmark. The marginal increase in insurance, benefits and other overhead is minimal-to-none, so the most lucrative billing (for your employer) is where you get paid the least.
