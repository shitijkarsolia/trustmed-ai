===============================================================================

Hello all, I am a third year medical student considering CT surgery as a career. I did it for part of my surgical rotation and feel like I have seen enough to know what I am getting into. However, when I bring up doing CT to basically anyone who is not a CT surgeon (Gen Surg, Surg Onc, Ortho) they all say that cardiology is taking over CT. They say cards will make much of the field obsolete during my career. The CT surgeons I talk to say that is not true. But I would like to hear from you all. What do you think the future of CT holds? Do you for see it becoming obsolete or is it a field that will still be viable for my career? I know no one has a crystal ball but I am curious to hear everyone's thoughts. Thank you in advance!

I do Mitraclip, but nothing compares to a mitral valve repair. I place pacers, and sometimes need CTS to place an LV lead when mine fail to get good biventricular capture. EP does PVI, but surgeons can do a MAZE. Some things I feel I do better are TAVR (sorry CTS, my endovascular skills are better than yours) and Watchman (which I feel to be superior to surgical ligation/excision). CTS is here to stay, and in dire need.

They’ll also be needed for coverage and won’t be needed to churn and burn (which gets old). Now granted that doesn’t mean it’s an easy lifestyle but they can have some pretty decent setups for a million a year.
