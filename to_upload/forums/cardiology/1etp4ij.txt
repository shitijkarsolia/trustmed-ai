===============================================================================

Looking for advice on how I can make this decision. I love critical care medicine, and have been debating for a while between Cardiovascular -&gt; CC or Pulm/CC. Now I got exposed to EP and I'm once again thrown for a loop. Really enjoy the science behind it and the procedures, though a lot of it is too esoteric for me to truly appreciate at this level. Looking for some advice on how to get a good grasp on whether EP is for me as an IM resident when it's just so intellectually far from where I currently am. Going to reach out to the EP PD here to see if I can come in for a case or two on clinic weeks but outside that any recommended resources I can peruse to see if I'm as truly excited by EP as I am by CCM? Thanks!!

To be honest though, even 1st or 2nd year cardiology fellows don't get as much out of the lab, esp in EP studies and ablations, it's very boring if you don't know what's going on. The best way I can explain is like watching the Matrix movie through only those green text scrolls, it doesn't make any sense, but once you start to understand signals, EGMs etc and can "enter the Matrix" so to speak, it becomes a eureka moment and the procedures become "cool". I think it would also be beneficial for you to see implants of newer devices like leadless dual chamber pacemakers or extravascular ICDs. Personally though, the complex ablations are what really got me into EP. I think you should first decide if you like general cardiology enough to do 3 years of that, and then having to re-apply into EP for another 2 years. It's a long road.
2. u/CardiologistCapital [score=5, created=2024-08-18T06:11:17]: I am currently an EP fellow. I agree that it is hard to get a grasp of what is going on since it is so far from what your exposed to with other fields of medicine. I absolutely love it, but of course I am biased. For one, I would argue it is the most "surgical" of all Internal Medicine subspecialties so if that is something you miss, then its good to get a taste of it. Also, it truly is amazing to go into a undifferentiated SVT case, make a diagnosis, treat it, and have a 95%+ of that arrhythmia never coming back. I agree reaching out and scrubbing into a few cases would be the best way to see if you like it. As far a resources go, there are some excellent presentations on Youtube, but probably going to be pretty esoteric. Really getting a good grasp of EKGs and indications for different procedures EP performs are probably a good place to start.

Consider though that the cards-ccm job market is going to be much more limited than pulm/cc. Meanwhile EP is unlike either in that it's a lot of clinic, procedures, M-F 8-5, call, patient messages, etc. You may even have to do some general cardiology as well.
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2024-08-19T01:32:40]: You should not be deciding between pulm/CC and cards/CC at all. If you want to be in the ICU very frequently, do plum/CC. The way critical care works, this is (by far) the best IM-based model to be able to practice critical care. Cardiology critical care, on the other hand, is for people who really want to do cardiology and just have a stronger interest in inpatient/CCU. It gives them a beefed-up skill set for that. You almost certainly will not be allowed to run a MICU with this background. If your goal is to do critical care go Pulm. If you are interested in cardiology (or any of its subspecialties), pursue cardiology. If you do pursue cardiology, it’s great to have a focus you are interested in, but you won’t really know until you are a fellow and get a lot more appropriate experience. From a practical standpoint, if you are interested in EP, it will open a lot more interview doors for you than saying you are interested in “cardiology critical care”. A vey small percentage of hospitals (even top ones) utilize “cardiology critical care” specialists. The programs that have this model will love your interest in it. The remaining (overwhelming majority of) places will range from not understanding it to being skeptical or outright hostile towards the whole concept. Practically speaking, it will be easier to match if your interest is in EP, HF, imaging, IC, ACHD or general cardiology with a specific unique interest. Again, you are very likely to change your mind again once in fellowship anyway (as I and many others did).
