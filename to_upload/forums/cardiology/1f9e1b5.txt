===============================================================================

I am a US MD internal medicine resident at an academic program in the Midwest intending to apply to Cardiology next year. My family is based in California and I would love to match and settle down in California, if possible. I’d consider my program a “mid tier” medicine program, we match well enough at other Midwest programs, but we have not had anyone match in California for cardiology for several years. I am wondering if doing an away rotation at a California cardiology program would be worthwhile for someone in my situation? On one hand, the idea of being able to get my “foot in the door” at a program that may not typically consider residents from my program is enticing. On the other hand, I am very aware that I will be in a hospital and EMR system that I would be unfamiliar with, where it would be hard to impress compared to the in-house medicine residents. Do California programs typically look favorably upon away rotators?
