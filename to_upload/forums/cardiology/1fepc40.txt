===============================================================================

Medical student here currently interested in applying a surgical subspecialty but I’m also secondarily interested in cardiology, and due to the competetiveness of surgical subspecialties, I’m thinking ahead of the possibility of not matching and soaping into another specialty. I noticed a lot of community IM programs tend to be ones involved in soap, and I’m wondering how hard/doable it would be for a US MD to match into ANY cardiology fellowship across the country coming from a community IM program

Just keep in mind that cardiology is competitive. Anything you can do to set yourself up for match success helps. Number one on that list would be “Go to a strong IM program with a good reputation.” You should probably try to figure out a little more about what you want to do. Cardiology may be the “most surgical” of IM specialties, but you are still firmly in the internal medicine camp as far as your day-to-day and training go. If you really want to do a certain surgical subspecialty, prepare for it now and apply broadly for programs—it’s easier practically and emotionally to move or go to a less prestigious program after med school than it will be 3 years later if you go the community IM —&gt; cards route. If you decide that cardiology is for you then apply to strong IM programs now and set yourself up for success during fellowship match.
