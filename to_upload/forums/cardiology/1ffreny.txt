Hello everyone! I have some wonderful news that I hope will bring favorable updates to all who have diligently prepared for their Echo Boards - ASCeXAM. I reached out to the boards, and they mentioned that the results are expected to be available by the end of this week. It appears that, over the past two years, they were issued on a Monday. Personally, I believe the results might be disclosed on Friday (today), but in the worst-case scenario, they could be released on Monday. Keep an eye on your email inbox and spam folder. Wishing you all the best!

4. u/Myocardoc [score=1, created=2024-09-16T03:58:58]: Passed, thank god. Huge relief! Congrats my dear friends!

Because of these questions, I was worried about the results. But we have a professor who is high up in the ASE chain and well known figure in the area of echocardiography. They told us that they will review all the questions following the test and remove some of those questions which doesn't pass validity. That kind of assured me. One thing I still don't like is why not remove those questions before hand. But there will always be some experimental questions in all the boards and that is the reality. I used Klein, Mayo lecture series, ASE q bank, and Feigenbaum(for the reference).

7. u/supercoolsmoth [score=0, created=2024-09-16T03:37:01]: I think people overhype the difficulty of this test. I thought it was a pretty fair test if you do all the Klein study questions and watch all the Mayo videos. There wasn’t anything that wasn’t covered in one of those two. I say this only because I think overhyping difficulty gives people unnecessary anxiety about the whole thing. For reference, those were my two sources. I also had no interest in echo as a fellow so my decision to take echo boards came after getting a job that required (I’m subspecialized so usually wouldn’t need echo). That’s not to say I didn’t try to learn things well when I was on though. I also went in to the test with 1 hr of sleep due to a teething toddler being up. I still managed to pass — that should tell you a lot. Edit: forgot that I also did the ASE practice exams and quiz — the real thing was very similar to this. So pay attention to what you get wrong in these.
