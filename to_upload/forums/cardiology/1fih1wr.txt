===============================================================================

I am currently working as a hospitalist. It's nice seeing that paycheck and one week on and one week off schedule. Applied for cardiology fellowship this year, God speed. I have few Questions for my attending Gen Cardiologists. I know it's very location/practice specific. 1) What does your work week look like? In terms of hours and calls? 2) How many weeks of vacation do you get? Are you happy with it? 3) Do you feel overworked or burned out? I know that's a common complaints of Hospitalists physicians. Thanks so much.

2. u/shahtavacko [score=10, created=2024-09-16T16:34:20]: 1. Work around 10-12 hour days, all but Fridays; Fridays are very variable, from 8-12 hours. 2. 6 weeks of unpaid vacation. Any cardiologist that thinks they have paid vacation doesn’t understand how their pay works (well, most, I haven’t seen one that is set up differently). I typically lose around 2-4 weeks of the vacation because I don’t have time for it. 3. I’m overworked, I don’t know that I’m burned out, I do feel that way at times I guess. I’m an invasive cardiologist, not interventional; I work for a hospital group; I do about one weekend out of 4 presently and I average around 12-13000 rvus per year.
3. u/Cornballer [score=3, created=2024-09-17T07:00:44]: I’m in the Netherlands so things work a bit differently here I suppose. We work as a collective. We have an acute PCI service so we have two different call rosters. I myself do CIED and heart failure. We all work 4 days. My week is currently more or less 1,5 day cath. 0,5 admin for CIED (basically troubleshooting and discussing cases my peers need help on). 1,5 day of clinic and 0,5 day other stuff. Full clinic day is about 40 contacts. In by 0800 out by 1730 except for the usual meetings (about once a week). Call is once every 8 days and weekends once every 8 weekends. 10 weeks off. I don’t feel overworked. Pay is fine. I feel pretty lucky to have found a group that makes enough money but is not intent on working themselves to death.
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2024-09-16T20:25:59]: Our non-invasive salaried guys get 12 weeks off.. which is on the higher end. Most are 6-8 weeks in our part of the country. But remember call isn’t counted as shifts like Hospitslists so if you’re in a heavy call group those nights and weekends aren’t included in that tally. If you subtract those extra shifts it can come pretty close to no vacation. They’re not burned out but they make 60-70% mgma with those 12 weeks and with pretty infrequent hospitalist-supported call since they’re in a big group. You can find some decent lifestyle gigs. Find a large employed group that has specific rotations (inpt, imaging days, etc) and it can be fine..
5. u/TillWilling6216 [score=2, created=2024-09-26T01:40:43]: Hi everyone, I’m developing a software platform designed to help cardiologists track their patients’ vital health data more efficiently. I’m looking for cardiologists who would be willing to share insights on the pain points you face in your day-to-day work and provide feedback on the app. Your input will help shape a tool tailored to your needs. As a thank you, contributors will receive free access to the platform for the first year. Thank you in advance for your support!
6. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2024-09-17T09:58:01]: Employed, 4.5days/wk, 45-50hrs, easy call 1x/wk, 1 weekend every 2mo. 6wks vacation plus random days off as I see fit, I'm happy. 10k- 11k rvus. I don't feel overworked and have found the right balance. But I'm paid by production, the less I work the less I get paid.
7. u/Medical-Rooster8709 [score=1, created=2025-02-02T19:18:57]: I get 10 weeks vacation a year. It's busy but very doable. I'm very efficient and go in at 9 am, leave by 5 pm, sometimes my notes are done by then and sometimes I do 1-2 hours more at home, off on weekends.
8. u/PositivePeppercorn [score=-18, created=2024-09-16T15:43:28]: How did you think it would be a good idea to apply to a subspecialty without having asked this very basic question in advance?
