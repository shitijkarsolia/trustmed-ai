===============================================================================

Thank you mods for allowing me to make this post. I know someone recently posted about being worried about not matching, but I would appreciate another perspective. This is my third year applying for the match. My first year I applied to 90+ programs and had 4 interviews. I applied to 12 non-accredited 1 year fellowships that year and interviewed at 4 programs but ended up not being accepted into any of those either. My second year I applied to 120ish programs and had 1 interview. This year I've applied to 135+ programs and am sitting at 0 interviews. I'm currently in my second year as a hospitalist at a large academic center, but the cardiology program here seems to prefer outsiders (aka not hospitalists at the program). I am wondering if my application is weeded out early and if there is anything I can do to fix it. I am a USDO who graduated residency from an academic/university affiliated program. I know more research would help my application, but I don't think reviewers are even getting to that part of my application. Do you think I am weeded out because of my board scores? Level 1 - 561 (that was my only year taking Step 1 as well and that score was 235) Level 2 - 536 Level 3 - My first attempt during intern year I failed. I really struggled that year mentally with adjusting but worked on my mentality and in six months, my Level 3 score went from the 200s (not passing) to 659. I address this issue in my personal statement, but I feel like that one exam "fail" immediately removes me from a lot of programs. I wish people would look at the actual scores and think something like "wow, she experienced this failure and seemed to have learned from it and improved exponentially." I would hope that overcoming this failure would show resilience, but my guess is that it's what is hurting me the most regardless of my second score. Is there anything I can or should do to help programs reconsider reviewing my application? Am I probably correct that this one failure is what has been holding me back? Any and all help is much appreciated!

It was about a 50/50 shot at matching to their general program, which was honestly my best bet at that point. Having a decent number of publications helps. Focus on getting some first-author papers in respectable journals if you can. However, I would focus all my efforts here only if you're confident that you can accomplish by certain deadline, not just abstracts, Otherwise you will enter the next cycle with similar CV. It's a process, but keep at it. You'll get there.

For reference, I applied during PGY-3 from a mid tier university affiliated program that has University in its name and has dozens of fellowships. I applied to around 120, and got 3 interviews (1 through connection). I applied to two new programs after not matching and also did not receive a match offer from either of those places. It was a really dark time for me especially since literally everyone else matched into something (two colleagues matched internally to the cards program so you can imagine how that felt). I went to see a therapist for a few months and I am sure I had mild depression. It took awhile but I was able to get out of that rut. I found an external PGY-4 Chief position and a currently doing that.i applied to 199 programs this year and to be genuine surprise have 9 interviews. My board scores: USMLE Step 1 243, Step 2 237, no Step 3 (COMLEXs all 500s). I have wha to consider a decent # of publications that tilt mostly towards abstracts. With that out of the way, I think a combination of things may be at play. Which one is the primary barrier I do not know. Anecdotally, folks who who seem to be 2+ years out of residency are having a harder time getting interviews. I certainly think the Level 3 failure does not help 😕. The way it was phrased to me is that PDs are finding any reason not to interview candidates and board feeling is low hanging fruit. I think being a DO also hurts us in general and especially can be exacerbated depending on one’s residency program institution. A DO from Mayo Clinic versus, say, a program that has a loose affiliation to some large academic institution will not be viewed equally. I think you would need to leave the hospitalist job and really commit to cardiology in terms of some kind of 1 year fellowship that likely will extend to 2-3 years of working at said institution in order to backdoor into a program. Part of why I say this also is I see USMDs struggling to get a good # of interviews. I recently was on an interview with a candidate who is an imaging fellow and she is a USMD from a decent program. I was shocked to see that. I am not sure what advice to give, but I just wanted to say I am right there with you. Feel free to DM if you want to vent or anything. I can share more details if you think that would help contextualize how you are doing. Edit: I think more research is not the answer unless you literally have &lt;5 research items. More than anything, you need to find a mentor who can vouch for you and aggressively advocate on your behalf. Those things don’t happen overnight as you surely appreciate so it may take some more time.
3. u/parachute45 [score=1, created=2024-09-27T17:36:40]: Did you have mentors aggressively emailing places for you to get interviews? I'm a DO reapplicant and that's made a huge difference for me. I'm also doing a one year fellowship. Programs are getting 700-900 applications, if you have some orange flags (DO, IMG, boards, visa) and no one advocating for you, the harsh reality I learned is they're not even going to open your app.
4. u/New-Exit-1983 [score=1, created=2024-09-28T17:52:38]: Not every institution is the same, and I agree with the IC above. Every program will have a set of filters to thin out some of the 700+ applicants. I don't know what the filtersmy program uses, but I know my program uses board failure as one of those criteria, sorry to say. There are still literally 500+ applicants after that filter is applied, all for 2-6 spots depending on the program. Although you had a tough time and subsequently came back with greater fortitude, programs don't know and won't know that if you get filtered out. All they see is another 500 applicants who didn't have the failure. To bypass the filter, you could send an email to every single program you applied to and let them know your situation, and ask them to review your application. If the program reads the email and feels compelled enough by your story, then you may get lucky and get reviewed. Half of the applications may reach the PD/faculty to be reviewed. I reviewed about 200 applicants and I know the program coordinator read all that were not filtered out. Re-applicants is not a huge detractor unless the application is the same, or we interviewed an applicant prior and we didn't like them. There are people who will have beefed up their application from year to year and they are now different people. Unfortunately, cardiology and desired subspecialties can be more about connections. I know the PD gets a bunch of phone calls and emails about applicants to review. That would be another way to get past the filter if someone calls on your behalf. Even if you had a co-resident who is currently in a fellowship program, they can ask the PD to review your application; that may get you past the filter as well. If you are get past the filter, I feel a majority of LORS, research are the same. Experiences and personal statement are big things that will get you the interview or get placed in the backup list, followed by interesting hobbies that resonate with the faculty. Make sure you have everyone you can, read that statement and get feedback to see if the statement really reflects who you really are. Finally, if you don't match, you can try to find newly accredited programs who are taking their first year class out of the match. That's how I was able to get a spot after I didn't match with 13 interviews, because there will be less applicants you have to compete against. Good luck with the process.
