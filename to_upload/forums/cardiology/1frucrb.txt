Hi all. I am wanting to go into cardiology fellowship. I am a current hospitalist and trying to figure out which cardiology conference I should go to this year. I went to and presented at the HFSA conference last year and had a good experience. I am hoping to at least attend a cardiology focused conference this year. I was considering the ACC conference, but it feels like that is the "big" conference everyone attends to try to advance their career, and I don't know how much I'd "stand out" in the largest crowd especially if I didn't present there. Are there any cardiology centered conferences that you think would be useful to start to develop connections that might also be useful for my current job as a hospitalist? Thank you in advance!

IC/structural: SCAI, TCT EP: HRS HF/Txp: ISHLT &amp; HFSA These meetings are easier to network and navigate as compared to ACC or AHA Scientific Sessions since they are smaller meetings. You can advance your career at ACC/AHA but you do need to be strategic (reach out to people in advance, arrange coffee meetings, go to specific talks, etc.)
