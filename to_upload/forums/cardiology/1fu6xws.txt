===============================================================================

Just wondering since there will be weekends where my partner might be gone/working and if I wanted to work more do I just take extra call from other partners or do y'all ever reach out to other hospital systems since their call rates are higher? I'm working likely in academics but if I pick up call at a community hospital, I imagine I could 1.5x my rate. Is that correct? What numbers could I be looking at as I sacrifice my weekend/sleep?
