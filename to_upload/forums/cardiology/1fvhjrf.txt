===============================================================================

Hi all, I’m trying to configure my third-year rotations and could use some advice. I’m interested in general cardiology and will probably sign with a large non-profit institution (aka prividemic place). I am level 2 in Nuclear and taking the boards this year. Per my discussion with our imaging leadership below are my options: * **Level 3 Echo:** * I’m somewhat academically oriented and would love to be an expert in something. * Most jobs will likely give me echo/TEE time. * Future leadership positions in echo could be possible with this path * I’m already Level 2 and echo-boarded at this point. * **Level 2 CT/MR:** * Being a multimodality imager is a big plus. * However, I feel like Level 2 MR isn’t as respected as it used to be, and I’m wondering if I’d need an advanced imaging fellowship to really get the most out of this path. What are your thoughts, Reddit community? Which path would set me up better long-term?

The level 3 won’t benefit you unless you are trying to bring a new modality to a hospital/clinic. You will need that extra exposure. MR is super if you love it. The time to read per rvu is high for MRI. That’s a reason to not go down that road. The more reps you get reading as a fellow with feedback the better off you will be prepared. If you want to be an expert imager for your future group I think you need that extra year - otherwise keep it simple.

3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2024-10-03T16:46:28]: Set you up better for what? What are your interests and goals? Are you genuinely interested in CT/MRI? Do you want to be an echo leader? If you have a job lined up or in mind, what's the situation with echo, ct/mri or other subspecialties? This discussion comes up time and time again and folks really overrate imaging stuff when it's generally not worth it. Meanwhile opportunities in HF, cardio-onc, womens health, etc. are ignored despite providing value.
