===============================================================================

Hello, Cardiology fellow here. I've wanted to do IC since end of medical school. However, after a couple of years of rotations with wearing lead, I've developed some back pain. Usually 2 or 3 out of 10, but 5 or 6 when it flares after a long case. My MRI showed osteophytic complexes and multilevel facet arthrosis. Didn't know what to make of it. I'm in my 30s. My PM&amp;R doc said I have signs of arthritis and that it could get better with strengthening exercises. So I find myself at a crossroads. On one hand, I don't want to make a rash decision and not do IC when this could get better with improved conditioning and better posture. On the other hand, part of the lack of conditioning is the time demands of the training. And if I'm already showing signs of arthritis at this age, is it worth it?

It has an endoskeleton that transfers the weight of the apron to your hips, similar to a camping backpack with an internal frame. It feels like the lead is floating over your shoulders, 100% recommend it. Don’t let MSK issues deter you from IC, there’s tons of alternatives too like zero gravity, rampart etc. that reduce exposure but they’re super expensive &amp; annoying. GLiFT is simple &amp; affordable

You don't always want to wonder what if. Get in whatever exercise/conditioning you can now and hopefully you can step it up once you have more time. If it all doesn't work out then you can always fall back on gen cards or take on a lighter load. Though you're likely to be in the cath lab less often as attending anyway.

At the same time, there are plenty of newer generation lead vests and skirts that are lighter and friendlier to the back. At the same time, you gotta lose weight and hit the gym. You can work with a physiatrist on which core muscle exercises will help with your back without further injuring it.
5. u/ColeV_2 [score=2, created=2024-10-15T09:08:09]: Depending on your facility, there are leadless systems like rampart and zero G available on the market. We have rampart in our lab and it's great. However, if you need to get IJ access, perf and need to tap , or a stemi (it takes extra time to drape the rampart) you'll have to wear lead. Our docs use the rampart for 90% of their cases and they say it helps with their back pain.
6. u/magicalmedic [score=4, created=2024-10-14T10:35:10]: My attending was told not to do IC and pursue advanced imaging because he had back pain. He did advanced imaging instead and developed worse back pain from sitting all day. Went back to IC and is a BOSSS!
7. u/VenusH024 [score=1, created=2024-10-21T01:18:06]: If IC has been your passion, it might be worth trying strengthening exercises and better posture to manage the pain before making a final decision. However, it’s important to also consider the long-term impact on your health, especially with early signs of arthritis. Balancing your passion for IC with your physical well-being is key—maybe explore less physically demanding specialties within cardiology if the pain worsens or doesn't improve. Keep an open dialogue with your PM&amp;R doc and give yourself time to figure it out. If you are looking for best cardiologist for treatment, look no further than Venus Hospital - the best hospital in Nepal.

This allows for little to no lead needed to be worn. Maybe look into that as another solution? Good luck with everything though, I’d recommend going to good feet store and getting soles fit for your shoes. Helped me out a ton.
9. u/Chief_SquattingBear [score=1, created=2025-05-11T13:36:51]: Did you ever figure this out?
10. u/UnhappyWater4285 [score=1, created=2024-10-14T14:52:29]: Do it if you can’t see yourself doing anything other than IC. Do exercises and go to a good chiropractor. It is worth if you are in love with it . HOWEVER Don’t get trapped by the prestige / money , for those who chose IC only for such reasons did regret it later .
11. u/wannaberesident [score=1, created=2024-10-14T20:06:40]: Was on the same dilemma - decided against doing IC. I asked around and decided to prioritize my health. Happy with the decision thus far, especially now that I cold-turkey'ed on cath lab and I try not to expose myself again to prevent relapse. That being said, I haven't started practicing. Only time will tell.
