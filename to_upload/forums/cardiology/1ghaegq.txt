===============================================================================

I am a first year fellow at a community cardiology program with interest in applying for EP fellowship. Would like to know the competitiveness and how much research is involved in securing a spot. I also intend to apply broadly. Thank you

Through no fault of yours I had to lock comments, but you are free to repost the question. If we can't maintain a professional decorum, I'll be happy to offer up some temp bans to cool people off.

But I’ve had friends train at very good places (eg ucsd ep) who did not do much research. Good luck! -HF PD
