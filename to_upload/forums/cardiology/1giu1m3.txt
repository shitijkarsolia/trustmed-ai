Hi reddit. I am an intern planning to go into cardiology. I am spending the month on our gen cards service. We have sent a lot of HFrEF patients to the cath lab for revasc. Unfortunately, I have already seen some complications, multiple patients on dialysis that is attributed to the cath, as well as some CCU stays requiring MCS. I read up on the REVIVED trial (as far as I know, the only RCT we have in this space) and it seems pretty damning. I listened to John Mandrola's take on it and I found it pretty compelling. I understand the diagnostic value of LHC for nailing the diagnosis. But outside of like, Left Main disease or symptomatic angina, why are we doing PCI for these patients?

Even with clinical trials, there is always room for clinical judgement (remember that trials typically study average effect for a population, not individual cases). 3. Not everyone adopts new trials as easily/quickly.
2. u/Grandbrother [score=8, created=2024-11-03T23:46:24]: Mandrola has made his career off of therapeutic nihilism - if he doesn't subscribe to his minimalist stance on everything he loses all relevance. He claims to be an objective voice but has just as much bias as anyone he calls out. A lot of what he writes about seems true superficially then when you really delve into it has holes everywhere. His whole take on DANGER-SHOCK and his butt-buddy Vinay Prasad chiming in was hilarious. REVIVED tells us that routine PCI shouldn't be performed simply solely for low EF outside of ACS. But a lot of patients end up in the hospital with ACS and have an ischemic cardiomyopathy. You have to consider whether your patient really falls into the REVIVED inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition as with many of these trials, people are often not willing to randomize the patients who stand to benefit the most. E.g. the young patient with TIMI 2 flow in the LAD and a huge territorial WMA. You have to delve into the details yourself and treat the individual patient. And any AKI after a cath gets attributed to the cath so that doesn't really mean much. True CIN is very rare nowadays.
3. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2024-11-03T21:37:51]: So, even though I don't usually consider PCI for HFrEF alone, there are some things to consider... \- It's not enough to just use the take-home points from a trial. You need to look in more detail. \- Upon reviewing REVIVED, I find it odd that they don't (at leas in an easy-to-find way) list the number of patients screened for the trial (This usually gives me a basic idea of how many people participating investigators "thought might be in the study group" vs the ones that actually were). \- "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence". This was a negative trial. It failed to show benefit. Furthermore, the CI for most of the interesting outcomes was clearly not decisive. Even a "negative trial" can dissuade you from doing something if the outcomes imply harm. I don't think that case can be made for this. In essence, it showed that using a PCI strategy didn't really seem to be much different from using a medical strategy alone. I don't think that means PCI needs to be forbidden (based on this data). \- If you look at "Table 2" for the study, the only significant outcomes were secondary and were: Unplanned revascularization (favored PCI) Bleeding at one (not significant at 2) year (favored no PCI) ...both of these are highly problematic to hang your hat on. If this study had shown that the primary outcome (death) were significantly worse with PCI (i.e. CI of 1.1-1.4), then I think you would have much more compelling evidence that harm is done with PCI in this setting. In fact, the treatment effect marginally favored PCI, though to a statistically and clinically insignificant degree (0.99).
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=5, created=2024-11-03T17:13:19]: I’ve found the non-invasive guys push it more than anyone. Just had a partner ask to cath his asymptomatic 88 yo because his EF is 35% with mild-moderate ischemia on his Nuc. Yea, no thanks.
5. u/zebubbleitexplodes [score=2, created=2024-11-03T21:10:58]: They also excluded anyone with ACS within 4 weeks and we know revasc improves outcomes in ACS. Could be that indication in your shop is not purely hfref, especially among inpatients. Also be cautious with mandrola, he overly simplifies data and doesn’t respect one of the most important parts of interpreting clinical trials, patient selection and the lack of belief of equipoise among those referring to trials. It’s likely the people selected for revived were those that were least likely to benefit from revasc because referring doctors would be hesitant to randomize someone who based on older trials would benefit (younger people eligible for cabg). It’s unlikely pci would be able to help someone who cabg wouldn’t. That being said, revived was generally a well done study so I tend to agree with your take. I would highly encourage you to read as much data for yourself as you can. You’ll find certain studies that are typically perceived as gospel actually have some major flaws and don’t reflect real practice (I.e. ISCHEMIA trial)
6. u/PNW-heart-dad-5678 [score=2, created=2024-11-07T18:48:02]: I’ve seen patients SUFFER from PCI single vessel disease when they have HFrEF not ACS. There is just little to no evidence for it. I take the following approach. No evidence for early invasive revasc for HF period. (LM dz aside). Even if a pt may benefit I want them optimized on max tolerated doses of GDMT with evidence of reverse remodeling and dried out. THEN if residual symptoms and or persistently low EF consider revasc after having a conversation about the possibility of benefit and the small risk of harm. Then proceed. I do not trust spect or ffr in decompensated HF. I’ve seen patients with decompensated HF have 3 vd by ifr/ffr then I optimize them and send them back to the lab and now they only have single vessel disease.
7. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2024-11-03T15:11:51]: Suspect the main reason is people’s practices have not caught up with the evidence from REVISED. I tend to stress test more than I used to since this trial was published. -HF attending
8. u/WSUMED2022 [score=1, created=2024-11-05T17:25:11]: Just out of curiosity, do you know if your institution does PCI with angiography only or do they routinely use IVUS/OCT/iFR? Sounds like a lot of complicatuons for routine PCI in otherwise stable patients.
