For the general cardiologists out there, any regrets about choosing general? As a fellow contemplating general, I worry about: - the grind and possibly higher burnout rate of doing outpatient clinic 3-5 days a week with 30-40 pts per day. - lack of diversity of case and complexity in practice (it seems a lot of general cardiology is seeing palpitations and the like as our field gets more and more specialized) - lack of diversity of what is done in daily practice (i.e. clinic vs reading vs procedure etc; more dependent on seeing higher volume of pts, as opposed to a subspecialty where you perform more different tasks throughout the week) Of course there are many advantages to general and disadvantages to sub specialties but the above are personally meaningful considerations. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you 🙏

In general, Gen cards is not grinding harder than the procedure based guys 2. Everyone is seeing palpitations and the like. Majority of subspecialists besides EP are doing Gen cards as the majority of their work. 3. There’s not less diversity.. maybe more.. probably the same. Everyone is doing the same stuff over and over. 4. Employed Gen cards in a big group with infrequent call and no procedure headaches can be a pretty good lifestyle - if you can tolerate being employed
2. u/cardsguy2018 [score=8, created=2024-11-06T09:49:29]: I'm gen cards, no regrets. You seem to be misinformed on multiple fronts. 30-40 patients a day is ridiculous and unrealistic. I see about 20. There's only so much diversity and complexity out there, and this is true for IC, EP, HF, etc. You have to be ok with the bread and butter of whatever specialty you choose. If you want variety via procedures, you have to decide whether you even want to do procedures and even then you're kinda splitting hairs as far as your day to day. Everything everywhere becomes monotonous to a certain extent. General still does echos, TEE's, nucs, stress tests, ct/mri if you choose that route. You can still cath (I still do RHC), cardiomems, etc. You can have a heavier inpatient presence too but this varies by job. General is absolutely not the worst type of call, not sure why you would think that.
