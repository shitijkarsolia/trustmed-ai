Per title. Ive seen Hospitalist/nocturnist position at Cardiology service. To me, this is kinda position to offload consult service. I passed initial IVs and soon IV w/group. To this point, i was sold this will help Fellowship matching. Be honest, Im not sure Im gonna apply fellowship in future (next cycle, definetely not applying fellowship). Your thoughts about this job? Pros/cons, longivity? Thanks in advance.

2. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2024-12-07T13:43:50]: Pro's is exposure to cardiology Con's is you don't get to actually do all the things cardiologists do Longevity is difficult since it's new; would try to find someone else who previously had this role and reach out/discuss. Some places (UCSF) have CV hospitalists which is usually a gap year to try and get in to CV fellowship
