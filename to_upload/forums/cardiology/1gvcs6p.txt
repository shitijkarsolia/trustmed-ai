Obviously an overly sensational title, and Mandrola is known to be a skeptic (self-proclaimed medical conservative). The OPTION Trial compared LAAC to oral anticoagulation in patients who underwent catheter ablation for Afib, and found that LAAC was non-inferior to oral coagulation with regards to stroke, systemic embolism, or all-cause-death, and superior in reducing risk of non-procedure-related major or minor bleeding. The trial was highly discussed at the recent AHA 2024 meeting and may lead to widespread changes in Afib management, which Mandrola is evidently concerned about. I'm just a medical student, so my perspective is limited, so I'm interested to hear what people in the field think of this trial and Mandrola's criticisms.

I actually think there is a reasonable chance that if you used "aspirin" as the intervention group (instead of Watchman device) and compared that to the anticoagulation group, you would have gotten the same result: aspirin would have been superior in the safety co-primary endpoint (bleeding) and the stroke/embolism/death endpoint would have shown noninferiorty. We need to hold clinical trials to higher standards.
2. u/OriginalLaffs [score=23, created=2024-11-19T18:53:52]: Mandrola’s take on OPTION, while perhaps overstated, is absolutely legit. This is an industry-sponsored trial clearly designed to be positive (ex they exclude procedure related bleeding… don’t see how that is excusable). This is a population with a low expected event rate (post-ablation). It is currently debatable whether patients with good post ablation outcome and few risk factors even need anticoagulation at all, in which case THAT is what is doing the heavy lifting in terms of the positive outcome, and the LAAO has nothing to do with it. If you have post-ablation patients party hats and stop DOAC vs continue DOAC and show the party hats group had less bleeding and similarly low stroke rates, did you demonstrate the value of party hats? Mandrola is right on this one IMHO- we need better studies before we start offering LAAO willy-nilly, and OPTION doesn’t really move us closer.

I get the criticisms that come with that but you also kind of need that too to really see what pans out over time as you push the envelope. So I have mixed feelings on it. Mandrola is a clown though.
4. u/vy2005 [score=9, created=2024-11-19T19:50:14]: Mandrola lost me with his criticisms of the GLP-1 trials for HFpEF. Basically saying that both KCCQ and HF hospitalizations are unusable endpoints because patients are functionally not blinded to their treatment arm. I get the criticism, but all the data, including biomarkers, 6MWD, and imaging is very compelling.
5. u/lobeams [score=13, created=2024-11-19T18:10:24]: Mandrola is a guy who likes to write inflammatory articles for layman-oriented sites like medscape instead of publishing research and furthering the science. He does a damn fine job of scaring patients and little else. And despite having criticized ablations in a similar way, he performs them on his patients. Can you imagine having an ablation scheduled for tomorrow morning and then reading his articles on it?
6. u/Mysterious_Job_8251 [score=3, created=2024-11-20T07:53:29]: Anecdotally, I deal with a lot of heart failure exacerbations after LAAC implantation. There’s a decently high proportion as well that either aren’t sitting flush with the orifice or have leaks or “non atrial side thrombus” not to mention the ones that don’t epithelialize and develop overt left atrial thrombus. I am not a big fan of the watchman and think most of the evidence is pretty weak. For the alcoholic with a GI bleed and neuropathy who falls all the time? Makes sense. However, I am unsure of the benefit overall.
7. u/Ok-Designer7283 [score=4, created=2024-11-20T19:35:50]: Have to agree to with Mandrola on this. I would’ve liked to see them separate the variables included in the primary efficacy endpoint. Throwing death of any cause together with stroke/thromboembolism is just poor analysis. It’s understandable why they did it - strokes occur at such a low rate in both groups and they needed statistical power to claim non-inferiority, but still. Larger, better studies are needed surrounding LAAO implantation
8. u/aupire_ [score=6, created=2024-11-19T20:15:28]: Layman but I work in the EP field and am quite interested in this debate and especially this recent trial. From what I've seen, once patients have the LAAO procedure explained to them, with the promise (or possibility) of getting off OAC, it doesn't really take much selling. I've never taken eliquis but clearly patients really *do not* like it. However I see some borderline cases where (again, not as a doctor much less an EP physician) I see 97 year old grandma getting a watchman and I do wonder where the benefit is. If I'm 97 I don't want to spend another day in the hospital for anything if I can avoid it, at that age all-cause mortality is extremely high period, I don't want people dicking around in my heart either even if it's "non-invasive." I've listened to mandrola's podcast a bit and it seems like his argument is that the patient population that would be most likely to get an actual benefit from LAAO is much smaller than the population currently getting it. So my question, and where I'm going with all this, is: what is the "ideal" watchman patient? is it 97 year old grandma who is otherwise pretty functional but with paroxysmal afib? and how often are OACs actually full-out stopped? Like what if you get a watchman than two weeks later oh look, a DVT... back to the pharmacy for an eliquis refill. Like there are supposedly way more indications for OAC than just afib. I'm over my head in a niche subreddit but if anyone wants to play ball with me I appreciate it
9. u/Acceptable_Cat_2135 [score=2, created=2024-11-24T13:47:41]: He should stop whining and push for an rct if he wants evidence The laao topic is extremely void of evidence I agree,even the choice of anticoagulation post device implantation doesn’t have a lot of evidence,aside adala trial nothing is out there If ya concerned push for studies I share his fear as Ep is moving more towards intervention as apposed to pharmacotherapy,which is logical American is heavy on the money side of things
10. u/systole01 [score=2, created=2024-11-22T12:17:21]: Unfortunately mandrola is the current version of the contrarian in EP. You have to take him with a grain of salt. Some of his criticisms are fair, many are based in what will sell an article. He gets a lot of attention. My disclosure is that I do plenty of Afib work, plenty of watchman implants. My watchman folks are some of my happiest patients. We follow our implants closely, we have very few leaks and our closure rate is 98%. Watchman is a good thing. One issue he raises with Option is not including implant related bleeding. We know about implant related bleeding. It’s been documented in all previous trials and in the registry. The data with option is purely related to how the device functions when compared to medical therapy without implant related issues included. Another is that they should have had an arm without OAC or device? I’ll just leave this one alone on a trial with an average C2V of 3.5. Our current guidelines do not advocate stopping OAC after ablation if indicated by C2V. All patients want off OAC so it is a valid concern from patients. This trial showed nothing unexpected, that oac and the watchman reasonably compare in efficacy after an Afib ablation. It should be an option for our patients if they are interested.
11. u/neutronneedle [score=1, created=2024-11-19T18:51:50]: As far as I know the Watchman LAAC was basically released in 2009 and FDA approved in 2015. The procedure LAAC did not happen much prior to this, but it started in 1949. The Watchman is mostly implanted in old people, because mostly old people have indications for it. Young(er) people get afib ablations essentially more often than old people, so if you go sticking a LAAC in all afib ablation cases, I'd wonder what the research says about having a Watchman for 50+ years after a 25 year old gets one (impossible to have happened yet with this specific product). So a fear is there is not long term data on the Watchman, but it's not a new concept (75 years). It was done "surgically" before.
