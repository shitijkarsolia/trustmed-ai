===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I am looking for any advice or feedback. I am currently working in the business setting and looking to make a move into the healthcare field. I have always had an interest in being a Cardiac Tech. The dream would be to work in a Cath Lab. I am currently trying to find the smartest/ cheapest route for myself. I was thinking about getting my EKG Certification to start than potentially getting a hospital or company to pay for my schooling down the line. Any advice is appreciated!

2. u/JuniorSquirrel3323 [score=2, created=2024-11-21T16:42:43]: I would get trained as an RT instead. Can still work in cath lab but you have more flexibility.
3. u/LegendOfKhaos [score=1, created=2024-11-21T16:37:07]: I graduated from a CVT program at a tech college. It wasn't very expensive (relatively), but I believe some hospitals will pay you back if you sign a contract to stay there for a while, but I doubt it's more profitable in the long term. The CVT program has you intern at a hospital for a semester or more, and often that internship doubles as an interview. CVTs are in high demand, though, so you don't necessarily need a job at your internship site. I personally went elsewhere. If you have more questions, let me know.
4. u/Remote-Status-3066 [score=1, created=2024-11-25T06:59:45]: I work in Ontario as a registered cardiology technologist. I love my job and would do it again any day! I took the program not knowing what it was, and I’m so glad I did. There’s a lot of different types of work you can do. You can streamline into only ECG, Holter Monitors or stress testing, or find a clinic that rotates techs between the 3. In Ontario we are not yet a regulated profession, while we could work in a cath lab it’s usually staffed by nurses. If you’re looking for cath lab specifically, at least in my experience, I’d either wait to see how this profession develops or go into nursing. Not sure what advice specifically you’re looking for, but familiarize yourself with ECGs, Pacemakers and cardiac diseases before starting to give yourself a head start.
