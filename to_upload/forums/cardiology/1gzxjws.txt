===============================================================================

Hi all, trying to figure out what a decent first job out of IC training should look like. Have gotten an incredibly broad spectrum of schedules, compensation structures, and practice models, and having a hard time making sense of it all. Personally looking for a smaller place where I can grow out of fellowship into a solid cardiologist/IC and build my skills and career gradually thereafter. Not interested in academics, research, teaching, or specializing further into CHIP/CTO/structural/peripheral off the bat. Not pursuing any particular HCOL areas; nor am I locked geographically. Eventually can see myself shifting more into a mixture of clinical and admin work. What would a solid starting job look like for the above wants? Including clinic/lab/call schedule, CME, admin support, and compensation? Any input very welcome! Thank you! Edit: I am incredibly grateful for all of the responses! Thank you guys, this is all very helpful to hear

Earning 20k RVU per year would put you above more than 90% of practicing ICs. - The median annual number of PCI for IC in the US is about 50. - Pay varies a ton, from lower-half 6 figures well into 7 figures. A couple of thoughts: - I highly recommend that you start with a job that gives you significant PCI volume during year 1. More is better. You can’t rely on just recruiting your own PCI patients. You need to have a stream of patients that you can do PCI on. This means taking call or working as part of a system that can make you the “procedure person” when you are on…at least some of your week. - How much is “significant PCI volume” for year 1. Obviously, if you can do a thousand, that would be great. That’s very challenging to do. I would aim for an absolute minimum of 100 in your first year. I would not consider a first-job that can’t supply at least that. - If you are interested in any non-clinical opportunities such as administration, leadership (not to mention teaching and research), consider that larger practices (and especially large health systems) often provide a lot more opportunities. Don’t rule out clinical jobs at academic institutions if they can give you what you need. - I know everyone talks about mentorship. If you can find good mentorship, great. That’s not always something that you can find out about a job, though. What you need are colleagues that are willing to help you out by discussing challenging cases, helping with coverage/call and occasionally joining you for a procedure. If the group is not microscopically small and has good camaraderie, you’ll be okay. - A lot of these jobs that pay at the extreme high end right away and/or make high RVUs really work you hard. That’s not a bad thing. However, it may not make the most sense if you want to explore non-clinical career options. - Unless you are planning to take a temporary job (like working at a high volume county or VA hospital short-term to get PCI experience) do NOT take a low-paying job. Not only will you get paid less, but many of these are scams for new-grads.

IMHO it’s worth taking less money to have a practice where you will be supported and you can grow. Also the idea of going to a small place so you can grow doesn’t really make sense - you’ll be on an island, that’s not a great situation for most.
3. u/kgeurink [score=16, created=2024-11-25T19:08:49]: Currently in my first job, 4 months in. Here's what I'd say. 1. Volume and lab time. Are you gonna be doing enough cases? I've done over 100 pci and get 4 days in the lab. Most jobs offered 2-3 days in the lab. Starting out I wouldn't take one with less than 3. 2. Gen cards burden. I only do one day gen cards/ ic clinic and otherwise no gen cards. Echo/nuc are optional. No gen cards call. This is amazing. 3. Culture. You need to find a group you fit with and some people that are gonna support you. 4. Compensation. I wouldn't accept a private job &lt;500, ideally 700. This is certainly possible, especially if you are not geographically narrow. If academic, top of the scale 400-500
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=28, created=2024-11-25T17:08:38]: A “smaller” practice where you can grow, etc is kind of a misnomer. It’s the opposite (ie, large group) where you can have protection, mentorship, and can grow at a more reasonable pace oftentimes. The safest models imo these days are large established employed groups. Now that’s not to say those don’t have a ton of issues (no autonomy) but they can definitely allow you to “grow” at a slower pace. The most volatility I see is with private practice groups still practicing a chaotic 1990/2000s practice in today’s world (rare) and/or smaller hospitals that are always fighting for coverage or having competing groups or completely clueless admin trying to exploit you with you having no protection with numbers. Obviously lots of variation to that out there but beware as “small” practices can be the most chaotic and exploitative in IC - minimal shared coverage, no partners for protection, more competition, more risk with procedure, etc But a large group (20+ docs, 5-7 ic, 700-850k with 8-12 weeks off) is what I would be targeting based on what you’re mentioning

6. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2024-11-27T00:53:24]: One thing to dad: the starting pay should be fair, but I would not focus too much on that. Look at the people who have been working there for 3+ years and see what they are taking home. Make sure that you will be able to follow in the same path (make sure they did not get a special deal by selling a private group to a health system or, if they are a private group, make sure that they don’t limit partnership benefits to just a few members). Some positions have really good starting pay but it doesn’t go up much after a couple of years.
7. u/clinictalk01 [score=3, created=2024-11-29T19:40:00]: Congrats. For a first job, I’d aim for a balanced setup—maybe 2-3 days in the lab, 2 days in clinic, and manageable call (Q4 or better). In MCOL areas, $450–800k base with a solid bonus model seems fair. For salaries - if you haven't seen it - this is a great [data-set of anonymous salary contributions](https://www.marithealth.com/auth/new-user?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vs-comm) from the community where you can see what salary others are getting including comp models, shifts, etc. Outside of salary - i'd look for good admin support (like an MA or RN), $4–$8k CME budget, and a place where you can grow without getting overwhelmed. A smaller community hospital or private group might be a good place to start, especially if you can find a good mentor. Good luck!
8. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2024-11-26T09:46:05]: Too many subjective variables to say and there's plenty exceptions out there. What you think you want or don't want will likely change once you start practicing. Certainly was the case for me. My schedule, tasks and even compensation structure has changed a bunch in just the past few years alone. I think the most important thing overall is who you're working with and the overall culture and support of the group/hospital. Overwhelmingly the top reason for unhappiness I see with other doctors is related to this. Doctor-unfriendly hospital, bad partners/ownership, toxic environment, etc. Not lab time, call, money, etc. Though they generally seem to go hand in hand. Some other thoughts. Take into consideration the patient population. Evaluate the call intensity, not just frequency. De-emphasize starting pay, look closer at how you're paid beyond that.
