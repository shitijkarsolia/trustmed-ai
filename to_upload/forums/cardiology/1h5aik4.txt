1. u/wannaberesident [score=5, created=2024-12-03T08:53:45]: Studied partially for around ~2 months (one video a day speed) with rotations. Dedicated ~1 week or so in my research elective. Did Mayo Board, ASE Board Review, ASE questions and Klein Q Bank once. Passed the exam comfortably ~80 percentile
2. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2024-12-02T17:32:13]: I started the February before my exam in July.

4. u/supercoolsmoth [score=3, created=2024-12-03T20:33:15]: I started around April/May. I was out of general fellowship for a few years as I had done 2 year of research and HF fellowship. I did mayo and Klein and the two practice tests from ASE. The real thing was very much like the tests from ASE so highly recommend that. I think with that preparation, it was a very doable test.

6. u/confoundedarab [score=2, created=2024-12-07T12:22:17]: Doable to not *seriously* start til March (depending on your schedule) but ideal is to go through as many of those Mayo videos before then for exposure and then it gives you a leg up in knowing what you’re good and bad at to focus on. Include Klein as a LEARNING tool with the Mayo videos + ASE practice tests for combined learning and gauging your knowledge base closer to exam. Edelman for physics.
