Cardiology fellow here. Im having trouble understanding the concept of HFpEF. Is HFpEF an specific disease of increased extracellular matrix and reduced distensibility that can be imitated by other disease such as AS, amiloidosis, HOCM, etc? Or is HFpEF a clinical syndrome caused by several diseases like the ones Ive mentioned? If you read some review papers its says the first thing, that is an specific disease with its own histopathology, epidemiology, etc but if you read the definitions used by guidelines it just says its symptoms of HF with preserved ejection fraction and signs of elevated filling pressures… but that definition can be caused by many things! Theres also a lecture on youtube of Mayo clinic boad reviews that explains using hemodynamic pressure profiles how HFpEF is unique and different from AS, HOCM, etc.

Mechanistically, I understand it as due to increased end diastolic pressures of the LV due to different diseases (uncontrolled HTN, HCM with or without LVOT obstruction etc.). AS and HOCM behave a bit differently due to increased after load from the obstruction and not impaired relaxation during diastole (which to be fair may also be present due to LVH there as well). Might be wrong, but this is how I have navigated it so far during consults etc.
2. u/Libyanforma [score=27, created=2024-12-03T04:03:27]: My key to understanding HFpEF came from an old episode of cardionerds podcast. Basically, HFpEF is not a concept but an umbrella term. Don't look at it as a single diagnosis and try to look for a spectrum of conditions and end results. That is most evident in the treatment plans for HFpEF, giving the priority to treat the underlying causes and conditions, unlike the 4 pillars of GDMT in HFrEF
3. u/mustbethatotherguy [score=17, created=2024-12-03T05:40:38]: I believe that HFpEF is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by symptoms of HF but with preserved EF which is caused by the diseases like the one that has been mentioned here (AS, HTN, HOCM). In these diseases, HF occurs due to diastolic dysfunction which leads to increased LVEDP. But as per Harrison's, other pathophysiological processes other than diastolic dysfunction is a cause for HFpEF as well. Examples include vascular stiffness, renal dysfunction, inflammation related with adiposity and more. This shows that HFpEF is not a single disease with a specific pathology, but in fact a clinical syndrome that could result from multiple pathophysiological processes, mainly diastolic dysfunction,but not exclusively that.
4. u/shahtavacko [score=6, created=2024-12-03T03:31:03]: I think for many reasons HFpEF needs to be separated from many other mimics (a few of which you mentioned). Here’s a brief overview of this I came across recently: https://www.vumedi.com/video/heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction-modern-day-diagnosis-and-management/?token=e3b25bd2-d7ef-4c22-915e-4b6afeea4e54&amp;utm_source=%5BEmail%20Subscription%5D%20Cardio%20%7C%20CC%2C%20HF_144836&amp;utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_campaign=Heart%20Failure%20with%20Preserved%20Ejection%20Fraction%3A%20Modern%20Day%20Diagnosis%20and%20Management&amp;utm_content=Heart%20Failure%20with%20Preserved%20Ejection%20Fraction%3A%20Modern%20Day%20Diagnosis%20and%20Management&amp;utm_term=Heart%20Failure%20Pharmacology&amp;link_data=eyJidWxrX21haWxfYWN0aW9uIjoiYyIsInJlY2lwaWVudF9pZCI6MjQzNzY2ODYyMCwibWFpbF9pZCI6MTQ0ODM2fQ%3A1tHgnh%3AZrBeJd5PNZA8a56WoXJEqvzurCQYKVjwRLgJQbUQgNs&amp;mail_id=144836 Hope it helps.
5. u/Sartorius2456 [score=5, created=2024-12-03T04:36:27]: The things you mentioned are specific diseases. HFpEF is an umbrella diagnosis of exclusion (I. E. All it means is you don't have low EF but you have heart failure syndrome). HF remains a clinical dx and not a path, echo, lab DX. It's mostly, if not all due to diastolic dysfunction but you can technically have it due arrhythmia if you have a normal EF.
6. u/justhanging14 [score=5, created=2024-12-03T06:07:38]: I did some research in HFpEF and I can see where your confusion is. I think the problem is terminology. You can’t think of it as a syndrome because then you are missing what sometimes is called ‘garden variety HFpEF’. This is a disease in its own right which is very different and treated very differently compared to others you mentioned. Garden variety Hfpef is the most common thing we see and is an inflammatory disorder caused by age and co morbidities. When I use the hfpef term in notes this is what I’m referring to, not hcm and amyloid etc, but obviously they are mimickers because they all present with the Hf syndrome and preserved EF but they are not the same disease. This is where your confusion lies. What do we call patients that have this syndrome (hf and preserved EF) but are still undifferentiated in that they can still have HFpEF, hcm, amyloid, etc? There is no term for this. Now a caveat is the even within garden variety hfpef there is considered to be a lot of heterogeneity and potentially many phenotypes that in the future might be distinguished as a different disease.
7. u/Specific-Fix9841 [score=5, created=2024-12-03T06:53:53]: physisican scientist in training here, with a particular focus in HFpEF - can provide my understanding from a basic research perspective. As many above said, HFpEF is a clinical syndrome which encompasses a wide variety of etiologies. Emerging basic science research is beginning to notice distinct molecular mechanisms contributing to HFpEF driven/associate with obesity (the more american subtype), and that associated with mainly hypertension (the “european subtype”). Like others above treating the underlying cause is important - which may be why GLP-1 drugs seem quite effective for these patients (although only obese HFpEF patients were included in the STEP-HFpEF trials). In the future as someone interested in the basic science aspect I assume the treatment regimens may be quite different if there were better patient stratification as opposed to only assessing parameters on echo.
8. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2024-12-03T06:45:06]: I think of it like ARDS - a grab bag of different insults which result in a similar phenotype and histopathology as the organ reacts to different injuries in a stereotypical pattern. Like ARDS or pulmonary hypertension or cirrhosis, there are few targeted treatments available because it is more of a final common pathway than a specific disease entity. These processes are hard targets, though HFrEF is the best example I know demonstrating that they aren’t impossible targets.
9. u/PNW-heart-dad-5678 [score=3, created=2024-12-04T16:07:27]: Cardiologist with 10 years of treating thousands of patients with heart failure. You are going to drive yourself crazy looking for a great answer. Here is my framework. HFPEF is a diagnosis when anyone gets treated by a provider with a diuretic and their EF is normal. I.e. Therefore many people are going to be misdiagnosed with the condition when they don't have it. Here is the framework: There are cardiac muscle conditions that cause HFpEF (ie Amyloid, HCM, Possibly Sarcoid, Iron overload, idiopathic (there are these idiopathic conditions where people have very stiff ventricles without any evidence of any other disease and these can be seen in families). Then there are the cardiac conditions that CAUSE abnormal filling patterns or hemodynamic consequences due to the muscle dysfunction ( valvular disease, ischemic disease, atrial fib/flutter ). Then there are the secondary causes of cardiac fibrosis that stems from systemic diseases such as long standing hypertension, diabetes, and maybe microvascular dysfunction. Lastly, there are all of the non-cardiac conditions that cause "hfpef" such as morbid obesity, sleep apnea, ohs, COPD exacerbations that cause diastolic dysfunction, renal failure, urinary obstructions, severe anemia. So to summarize 1) intrinsic cardiac muscle diseases 2) valvular/coronary/arrhythmias diseases leading to elevated LVEDP 3) systemic diseases that cause diastolic dysfunction and elevated LVEDP 4) non-cardiac disease that cause diastolic dysfunction and elevated LVEDP and 5) non-cardiac disease that mimic heart failure with or without elevated filling pressures.
10. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2024-12-03T08:23:01]: Sometimes when I'm confused by a disease I just consider it from a slightly different perspective. One way to consider the taxonomy of a disease is to define it by what treatment it responds to. Patients with HFpEF benefit from SGLT2i as shown by EMPEROR-Preserved. Patients in this trial were pragmatically defined as "New York Heart Association functional class II–IV chronic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%. The protocol required patients to have an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level of more than 300 pg per milliliter or, for patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline, an NT-proBNP level of more than 900 pg per milliliter and did not have a disorder that could change their clinical course, independent of heart failure". So for me it's a clinical syndrome supported with an elevated BNP.
11. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2024-12-03T19:02:16]: Unfortunately the current diagnostic criteria of HFpEF are primarily what it is NOT. It is a preserved EF (e.g. not a reduced EF) and evidence of clinical congestion This broad criteria for a syndrome have left the HF community limited in terms therapeutic options because of how heterogeneous HFpEF has been over time. Many have tried to sub categorize or phenotype (e.g. obesity HFpEF, hypertensive HFpEF) which is probably a step in the right direction. \-HF attending
12. u/Gone247365 [score=1, created=2024-12-03T20:09:00]: Sounds like, from reading these comments, it is both a syndrome and in some cases a specific, as-yet-to-be-differentiated, disease process of the myocardium (which begets its own chicken vs egg situation with precursor comorbidities), thus leading to your confusion when HFpEF is being used without further description.
13. u/supercoolsmoth [score=1, created=2024-12-03T20:26:26]: To add a bit more nuance to some answers above though — yes, a lot of things cause HF in which there is a preserved ejection fraction, but increasingly, HFpEF when there is nothing else going (amyloid, valvular disease, etc…) does seem to be the result of a abnormal metabolic state that affects myocardial function. So i think currently it is used as an umbrella term but over time it’ll become more a phenotypically specific disease that requires exclusion of other disease states that cause HF with a preserved EF. I would not lump a 67 year old obese woman with hypertension, diabetes and HFpEF and a 40 year old patient with HCM and HfpEF as the same disease. Over time, either what we used to refer to the former will become a more specific term or the broader umbrella term will be abandoned
14. u/Silly_Bat_2318 [score=1, created=2024-12-04T05:00:03]: HF- defined as clinical signs and symptoms of HF + either a structural and/or functional defect of the heart. HFrEF- the above with reduced EF HFpEF- the above without r reduced EF, however, we still need to look at ED/ESLV volumes, CO and pressures. As you can get “preserved” EF (which is just a fraction of 2 values) but low CO. Just like in Pulm FTs - in restrictive lungs- your ratio is “normal” but your actual FEV/FVC/TLOC values are lower
15. u/uiucengineer [score=1, created=2024-12-04T12:02:48]: I’d be interested in seeing any references that call it a specific disease.
16. u/ratpH1nk [score=1, created=2024-12-05T15:05:46]: It is a clinical syndrome. It can be all of the above. LV compliance changes as a function of aging, comorbids and acute pathology. HFpEF for most is the sequaelae of chronic HTN and aging. There might be a predisdisposition of F&gt;M. The rest are secondary causes of HFpEF. The easiest way to think about the heart failure aspect is the LVEF is WNL but the absolute volume is lower beat to beat due to increased filling pressure. In addition, with tachyarrthhmias decreased filling time (HFpEF is time dependent) worsens the beat to beat blood volume ejection. Sorry if that is not what you meant, I am also in a meeting. :)
17. u/StepChemical3329 [score=1, created=2025-05-31T03:27:28]: You're touching on the core ambiguity of the HFpEF diagnosis — and I tend to agree that it's often used too loosely, especially in acute care. In the emergency department, we frequently see HFpEF diagnosed based solely on dyspnea, elevated blood pressure, and a preserved EF — often without any meaningful structural, rhythmological, or hemodynamic workup. But a structurally normal heart shouldn't "fail." If there's no significant valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, hemodynamically significant arrhythmia, or infiltrative process, acute decompensation should raise red flags for alternative diagnoses. In my experience as a cardiology consultant, nearly every patient with preserved or mildly reduced EF had a clear, often mechanical reason for their presentation — especially severe valvular disease. Personally, I think HFpEF is more of a **diagnostic abstraction** introduced to group together multiple causes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, rather than a disease entity *per se*. Importantly, in most major HFpEF trials, patients were not “pure” HFpEF as currently defined by guidelines. That is, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) should require signs and symptoms of HF, EF ≥50%, elevated filling pressures (at rest or on exertion), and objective structural or functional cardiac abnormalities — *in the absence of significant valvular disease, pericardial pathology, high-output states, or alternative causes like PE or arrhythmias*. In many of these trials, echocardiographic assessment was either missing, outdated, or not performed during the index decompensation. Some relied on echo studies from months earlier, and significant valvular disease was not systematically excluded. Others used only ICD codes or vague clinical scores to define heart failure. Crucially, **no systematic echo or radiographic assessment was performed to confirm actual congestion** at the time of enrollment. As a result, these trials may have included a large proportion of dyspneic patients without hemodynamic evidence of volume overload — diluting any treatment effect and undermining the specificity of the HFpEF construct itself.
