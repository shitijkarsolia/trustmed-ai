===============================================================================

I’m a junior UK cardiology specialist registrar currently learning to do echos. I’m able to do a full scan according to the BSE minimum dataset and can get good images compared to my peers. I know around 50% of what needs measuring and where on a basic TTE. I am struggling so much with learning to report though. We don’t have any formal teaching other than a sonographer helping with difficult windows or telling you what to write on the report. I’m struggling with how to go about learning it. I have signed up to an exam in the hopes that it’ll push me to learn more but I honestly don’t even know where to start. Are there any good resources that come recommended?

2. u/EchoTrucha [score=7, created=2024-12-03T14:01:12]: For actually learning to read an echo and fill out the report, most software has the generic sentences made out: but I have my students print a copy of this: AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT Recommendations for a Standardized Report for Adult Transthoracic Echocardiography: A Report from the American Society of Echocardiography’s Nomenclature and Standards Committee and Task Force for a Standardized Echocardiography Report. It is very comprehensive for 2002 but does not have things like Takotsubo, etc. But it is a great learning tool for the basics on all valves and chamber, etc. good luck.
3. u/astrofuzzics [score=5, created=2024-12-03T19:39:46]: Keep it simple. Many people learning echo want to write a lot in the report, probably to mitigate some of the paranoia about missing something. Resist this urge. Simple is better. 4 chambers (LV and its walls get some special attention), 4 valves, pericardium, great vessels. Most important is to answer the clinical question at hand. If you report something, that means you think it’s relevant and worth attention. Avoid pointing out absence of pathological findings unless you know it’s relevant to the clinical scenario - e.g. in a bacteremic patient referred to evaluate for endocarditis, if there are no vegetations, I would write “no vegetations.” If it’s a routine follow up echo for a patient with diastolic dysfunction, I’m not going to write that. Also, if a mitral valve is normal, I’m not going to write “bi-leaflet mitral valve with no leaflet thickening, calcification, prolapse, flail, restriction, papillary fibroelastoma, perforation, or cleft.” I’m just going to write “normal mitral valve.” This is an exaggeration but you get my point.
4. u/Cornballer [score=5, created=2024-12-03T12:19:06]: “ Questions, Tricks, and Tips for the Echocardiography Boards” by Sorrell et al was great for me. Lots of practice questions and explanation with theory. This got me through the EACVI exam. The EACVI handbook is a great resource. As far as reporting goes. I don’t really know what kind of guidance you’re getting but in general I can say that a systematic approach is essential just like ECG’s.
5. u/elliegsw [score=3, created=2024-12-04T03:47:18]: I have a reporting template I use (according to BSE standards) I can send to you if you’d like. It’s not fully comprehensive as I do a lot of free typing still but saves me so much time on my reports as I’m a bit of a perfectionist with them and like them to be consistent. I also frequently look at old reports my colleagues have done and will save wordings of certain pathologies in a word document so I have that to refer to.
6. u/dramajemzzz [score=2, created=2024-12-04T03:51:48]: 1. LV diameter/thickness and systolic function. RWMAs. Diastolic function. 2. Left sided valves. Aortic size 3. Atrial sizes 4. Rv size and function 5. Right sided valves. RVSP. IVC 6. Pericardium. Grades: trivial, mild, moderate, severe. Also refer to the guidelines your practice follows. Quote gradients if significant. Keeps it simple if overly normal/trivial. Answer the question. If you can’t confirm or exclude things (I.e bacteraemia) don’t imply that it’s normal, say the valves are unrestricted instead of normal and cannot be excluded with this modality. Just a few things off top.
