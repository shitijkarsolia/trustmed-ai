===============================================================================

Hey guys, I unfortunately didn't match to EP this cycle and was surprised by how competitive it's become. There were only two unfilled spots post-match, and each of those positions received 30-40 applications! Meanwhile IC had 56 unfilled and 70 unfilled (although I'm sure not all of them are "real" unfilled spots). I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach this. I know I definitely want a career in EP, and I plan to reapply next cycle. I currently have a wonderful job as a general/imaging guy, and my colleagues have been very supportive of my EP plans. I'm trying to decide between: 1. Staying at my current place and focusing on bolstering research. My CV was fairly healthy research-wise, so I'm not sure how much this would help. My current workplace is (pseudo)academic and has an in-house Cardiology fellowship, but no EP fellowship. My colleagues already offered to keep me on as I prepare to re-apply next cycle. 2. Doing a 1 year HF fellowship as a pathway to EP. Although I'm not passionate about HF, I'm curious enough about that I think I'd enjoy doing it for a year and then moving on to EP. Question is, will it be seen favorably by EP programs? I'd probably try to do this at a place with an in-house EP fellowship. 3. 1 year arrhythmia/research fellowship. Not many of these around, but found a couple. This would probably take me away from clinical medicine, which I'm not too keen about leaving. Thanks for your thoughts. If any of you guys do hear of an open spot later this year or next year before July, please keep me in mind!

2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=19, created=2024-12-06T19:30:41]: Doesn’t surprise me that EP is popular. When I’m in clinic, I send at least 2 patients to an electrophysiologist for each one I take to the cath lab.
3. u/KtoTheShow [score=3, created=2024-12-06T21:16:42]: Can anyone at your current program review your application and provide feedback? Trying to pin down what your gaps may have been can be helpful. Between the 3 options you've listed, I would rank 1&gt;3&gt;2.
4. u/gibolas [score=3, created=2024-12-07T07:40:47]: I'm a third year fellow in the same boat my friend. Scrambling to figure out what to do. Had my sights set on EP back in residency. I was surprised not to match and in hindsight I would have applied much less regionally if I had known how competitive it would be, but I wanted to be close to family. Would have definitely opted to move across country vs not matching, though, as it's hard to imagine doing something else at this point and was really looking forward to all the lab time I'm getting in my 3rd year. I was able to get feedback through a contact who told me my top choice did not feel I was enthusiastic enough during my interview, which is really frustrating because I definitely didn't feel unenthusiastic. Anyway, I'm interested in what you decide to do.

6. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2024-12-07T08:31:01]: Definitely not 2.
7. u/Uppers [score=2, created=2024-12-08T05:19:53]: Hmm this is disheartening. I’m planning to apply EP next cycle and it seems to be getting more competitive. Any advice for an upcoming applicant? My EP attendings said they would call on my behalf.
8. u/afibarveear [score=2, created=2024-12-10T10:20:14]: I wouldn’t waste a year of attending income to do a unaccredited fellowship. Even if you do it, there is no guarantee you will match next year and you would have just wasted a year on nothing. My advice is to take a job as a general cardiologist at an academic center that has an EP program and try to get more research and make connections that way. Even if it takes a few years to match, at least you will be making good attending money.
9. u/wannaberesident [score=1, created=2024-12-07T14:15:13]: Here is another thought why EP has gotten more competitive this year. They just become 2+2 this year which meant there were a lot more applicants as it allowed both second year and third year fellows to match this year. If this indeed was the reason, next year should be an easier match. That being said, 2+2 will probably make the EP match more competitive in general as now the additional year of lost income is gone with this pathway. To OP, I would highly highly recommend pursuing the research route - you can do locums/moonlighting or get a part time gig on the side doing research. EP is a small world and connections do matter. I can’t see how an ADHF fellowship would help.
