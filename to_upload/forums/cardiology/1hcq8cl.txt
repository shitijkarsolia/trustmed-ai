Hi… Im a cardiology resident in Spain (here cardio its a residency, not a fellowship). How difficult would it be to match a EP fellowship being an IMG with no letters of recommendation or observerships? I could do the steps and get my ECGMG certification but I dont have the resources to do a rotation there.

2. u/strikex2 [score=10, created=2024-12-12T19:05:24]: Not possible without doing a 3 year ACGME accrediated general cardiology fellowship first. Met an Italian guy at a conference a couple years back who was doing a non-accrediated EP fellowship with Dr. Natale's group at TCA with plans to practice back in Italy. Not sure about the details but perhaps something you can look into.
3. u/afibarveear [score=6, created=2024-12-13T05:49:40]: You would have to redo IM residency (3 years) and general cardiology fellowship (3 years) in the US before applying to EP (2 years). IM is easy to get into. From there cardiology has a 66% match rate and EP has an 85% match rate.
