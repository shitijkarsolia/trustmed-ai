===============================================================================

I went to a USMD school and University based IM residency here in the States. For family reasons, I'm now working as an academic Hospitalist but plan on applying to Cardiology. The catch is most of my family live in Austrailia or Canada now and I'd like to explore options regarding training in one of those countries (or even other English speaking countries such as the UK, Ireland, NZ, etc out of curiosity) and possibly settling there versus coming back to the US. Is this a feasible option and does anyone know how that process would work? Anyone here have experience working or training in those countries as well? Thanks

Specifically, will it allow you to practice in the US? I don’t know your whole story, but keep in mind that the US is among the highest-paying countries for doctors while the UK and many commonwealth countries are among the lowest paying. That may be okay with you (family/community/etc.) but it would be nice to have the option to practice in the US.

You need to be able to see if your IM qualifications can be cross credited to the equivalent with AHPRA/MCNZ and the RACP. Then apply to the matches across hospitals. For some states in Oz it is centralised, and in Nz it is hospital specific. Usually they take people that they have worked with and can trust and have a good rapport with. Happy to discuss if this is helpful.

It will be easier if you do your cardiology training in Australia. There is a shortage of Physicians right now and you may be able to your MD and residency experience accepted. Transfering specialist qualifications used to be difficult. They did accept UK and Irish qualifications and depending on the need, South African too.
