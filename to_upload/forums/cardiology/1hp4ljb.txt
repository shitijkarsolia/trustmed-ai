===============================================================================

Hey all, current first year fellow still trying to figure out what kind of cardiologist I what I want to focus my time on during training and what skills i want to learn. I have no interest in doing procedures like cath or EP, so I'm out on them. Literally even less interest in advanced heart failure and ever hearing the words IV milirinone with bridge to LVAD again. And no way jose on congential cardiology. Wanted to ask y'alls opinions on the advanced imaging fellowships a lot of places have. I know a common sentiment is they're not necessary, and not ACGME accredited, but looking forward into what kind of practice I want to be part of and what I want my day to day responsibilities to focus on it might be worth it. I like echo (including TEE), my program allows us to get Level II nuclear numbers. I would also be interested in reading cardiac CTs and cardiac MRIs. Now asking around the faculty and 3rd year fellows at my program, reading cardiac MRIs are not worth it for private practice. Takes a lot of time, access to an MRI machine and the RVU is not worth the effort. However the 3rd year fellows applying for private practice have told me that a lot of practices have asked them if they're CT board certified/eligible as they read their own CTs. For reference I'm at a fellowship in Philadelphia. I wouldn't mind my day to day responsibilities to be reading echos, doing TEEs, nucs and CTs. I'm hoping if I join a private practice I can take on these responsibilities and hopefully exchange that for less inpatient consult time. I like clinic so I can keep that as a major patient facing interaction. Is that feasible? I just really detest inpatient consults and would prefer to avoid being inpatient and rounding as much as possible. What I don't want to end up doing is all the TEEs for TAVR, mitral clips and LAA closure devices. There's an advanced imaging guy at my institution and he literally does all the TEEs for these cases. They work this guy like a dog, and if cath lab decides to start the mitral clip at 430, well he's there until the case ends. I want to be as in control over my time as I possibly can. I don't want my time dictated by the interventionalist or the EP. So i don't want to pursue advanced imaging if I end up in a job like this. I've also talked to some faculty who took CT courses and got board certified on their own. Again, if all I really need for a good PP profile is CT proficient than it might not be worth it do a fellowship year. Personally, I enjoy reading echos and nucs. While inherently i'm not the biggest fan of patient interaction (yes I realize now maybe i should have done radiology), I actually don't mind clinic. My fellow's clinic is well staffed, good amount of resources and attending's give us a lot of freedom to institute our plans. So going into practice I don't mind clinic responsibilities. I just really want to re-iterate I hate inpatient and want to avoid it as much as possible. There's 1 vs 2 year advanced imaging fellowship. One year for PET/CT/MRI and the 2nd year is usually for the advanced structural TEE experience. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts. Those who decided against advanced imaging or pursued it or those who got CT boarded on their own. Thank you guys!

He wanted to do structural work but anesthesiology was doing it there. My current institution advanced imaging person spends a lot of time on CT, MRI, structural interventions. We are base + wRVU and she is the least productive by far. I would pursue the advanced imaging if you want to be an imaging director, echo director or want your time to be mostly CT and MR. If not, I would stick with general and try to find the job that fits what you want.
2. u/BadonkaDonkies [score=9, created=2024-12-29T13:33:31]: The imaging is great but cardiac CTs and MRIs can be very time consuming. I think if you want to focus on those and other imaging academia would likey be better suited less pressure to hit RVUs. Academia will generally pay less than PP, but still very comfortable. Mostly all private practice groups you will be doing ALOT of general cardio, like &gt;75-80% easily. Depends on what you want. Doesn't hurt to have the qualifications, doesn't necessarily mean you must use them if you decide you don't want to
3. u/wannaberesident [score=7, created=2024-12-29T14:57:44]: My take as a general fellow who eventually decided not to do advanced imaging fellowship. I think it really depends on what you eventually want to do. If you are looking for a &gt;2 days of reading time, and if you are looking for cross sectional imaging as a big part of your portfolio and want to live in a big city, I think it’s worth it. If any of the above is “no”, I don’t think it’s worth. Personally, I enjoy clinic and TEEs but can’t see myself reading for 3-4 days a week that’s not what I signed up for when I start doing Internal Medicine. Job market for general cardiology is hotter than advanced imaging - I also find getting a skill set and not using as some above users suggested it after 6 years of PG training, kind of waste of time. If you’re PP-bound, I wouldn’t recommend advanced imaging either. CMR and CCT are low RVU skill sets, and most institutions either don’t have both, have both but low volume, or have both but not control both (like radiology does). Most institutions separate structural imaging and cross-sectional imaging, so you shouldn’t be worried about getting stuck in structural cases. I agree with you that structural imaging is a terrible deal for any cardiologist right now. The radiation exposure is terrible, the reimbursement is low, and the occupational hazards and lack of schedule control are the same as an interventionalist. I wouldn’t be worried about getting stuck at inpatient, most jobs I came across were actually predominantly outpatient based where the access issues lie at. If you eventually decide to imaging fellowship - here is my take on them. As you pointed out, some good ones (NW, CCF) are two years and breaks down like you suggested. I wouldn’t do the at if you are not into structural stuff. BWH is another top program that is more cross sectional oriented and two years. I probably would have pursued a one-year CCT/CMR combined level 3 programs based on what you have indicated.
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=5, created=2024-12-29T13:53:27]: I would just fight to get level 2 in echo, nuc and Ct Sure not super ideal for CT but you can learn as you go. I wouldn’t waste a year and 500k+ on an extra year if you’re looking for a comfortable community set up. Even then no guarantee you can read CT even if you did a fellowship.
5. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2024-12-29T22:36:55]: I think way too many fellows don’t understand how most practices work: in one way or another, you tend to be paid based on productivity. What this means is that most of us want to read trans-thoracic echos and various types of stress tests. It’s one of the most efficient ($/hour) things we do and it relaxes the schedule to make more time for other important things that loose money (I’m looking at you, diagnostic angiograms). Aside from salaried positions (Kaiser, VA, county, etc.), no one is going to WANT you to read echos. They may LET you read them, but they are taking a loss by doing that. In my opinion, you should only do an advanced imaging fellowship for two reasons: (1) You are just super interested in it to the point that you are willing to spend an extra 1-2 years in training to scratch that itch or (2) you really want to be an imaging lab director or advanced imager at a large group/institution. In general, if you really want to be an imaging director keep in mind that it will probably not help you financially, it will limit job opportunities, and you most likely will be expected to have some sort of participation in the structural program. To participate in structure procedure imaging (which it sounds like you want to avoid), imaging fellowship is “nice to have” but not mandatory, CMR and CT are things that groups are interested in but, outside of academic research, they don’t tend to help your career too much. MRI machines are generally owned/controlled by radiologists and CMR is something that they generally take a financial hit by offering. You may be able to count the number of (non-academic):cardiology groups that own MRI machines on your fingers. It looks like CCTA is going to start paying more and you can add on CT-FFR in some cases. However, very few cardiology groups/departments own scanners (again, radiologists do) and there remains the concern of missing extracardiac findings (liability). CT does seem to be a developing area. However, even though I am a big fan of CT, I’m in the minority opinion who do not think that it is going to become more prominent in the future (for a few reasons). I may be wrong. In terms of pay: In my large teaching institution, our imaging director is paid on the same productivity scale as general cardiologists. He also gets a nominal stipend for running the lab. He is at about the 25-50th percentile for income among our general cardiologists. He likes that part of the job and, especially, teaching fellows to be good at echo. Not bad, but you can see that money is not the reason to do it My advice: If you are super interested in imaging, really want to be the best at imaging for structural procedures and/or really want that rare imaging job running the lab: go for it! Imaging is interesting and imaging gurus are great resources for the rest of us. Otherwise: general cardiology is a great option. However: - On average, it will not increase your expected pay beyond general cardiology. - It’s still more likely than not that you either won’t be able to participate in CCTA or that you’ll take a pay cut to do so. Same, but more true, with CMR. - Unless it’s your passion and focus, you are unlikely to be doing/reading CMR. - If you are not going to do structural procedure imaging, you are most likely to basically be a general cardiologist, even if you have this training.
6. u/astrofuzzics [score=10, created=2024-12-29T13:35:33]: I am a current advanced imaging fellow. The catch-22 in your objectives is more or less as follows: you want a job that includes echo, TEE, CT, nuclear, and clinic. You have to work at a hospital that has all of that equipment, which is not cheap - the hospital has to have sufficient patients to make all of that hardware financially viable (doing 5 nuclear studies a week is not going to keep a nuclear lab financially solvent). Basically, you’re looking at working at large, urban medical centers; the kinds of hospitals that attract competitive job-hunters. Those with a dedicated imaging fellowship under their belt will have a competitive edge, so without the fellowship you may be looking at community centers, many of which will not have all the equipment you want. This principle applies to private practice jobs as well. This is something that applies not only to your first job, but also to subsequent job applications 5-10+ years down the line, at which time no doubt imaging training will be quite robust and possibly accredited. At that point, you will definitely be out-competed by people with fleshed-out fellowships under their belts. Basically, if you’re going to just do extra CT training, you may lose out on some opportunities. You’re probably not going to find a dedicated imaging fellowship that just does CT, but you’ll probably find one that does CT and MRI or something like that. You can do a year of training in that and then just read CT when you go into practice, but you will always have the fellowship under your belt forever - and that can be the difference between nabbing a great job you really want vs. getting edged out by someone with an extra line on their CV.
7. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2024-12-29T16:22:34]: Not worth it. I also doubt many attendings out there wanna trade for more inpatient time. But there's certainly jobs out there with little to no inpatient without having to do CT. You're absolutely right about MRI and structural TEE. But CT isn't necessarily a whole lot better. Edit: Just saw that you prefer to not even see patients and would rather be 100% imaging or even a director. In which case it's probably worth it and even necessary.
8. u/Normal_News_1080 [score=2, created=2024-12-29T17:15:16]: I’m in the same boat right now. I’ve been practicing as a general cardiologist for 7 years. I have done the CT course and am level iii. I’ve been imaging director at both of my jobs and started the ct program at my current. They aren’t huge programs but have all imaging modalities. First job - rads controlled ct. Cirrent job we do ct and potentially mri on the near future. I’m looking to do advanced imaging fellowship for a couple of reasons. One is for MRI as most fellows will be coming out of fellowship with CT based on the new Cocats, second I want to stay relevant as a cardiologist. It’s a field which is becoming saturated with sub specialists and being general in 5-10 years may not be enough. I’m afraid that I would be easily replaced as imaging director once someone with an advanced imaging fellowship comes along. I’m also tired of referring out for everything in cardiology. I’d like to at least be able to manage the imaging aspect of my patients from A to Z. It’s a tough decision for me because I have a family that I’d have to leave for a year of fellowship. The fellowship itself seems pretty nice with no calls or weekends. In the end I think it’s a personal decision. I still have a good 20-25 years of work ahead of me and am looking at the future of this specialty. Staying relevant is important.
9. u/UnhappyWater4285 [score=2, created=2024-12-30T17:13:56]: Interesting topic . In my academic institution I see advanced imagers happy with their schedule and reimbursement . Would like to see more input from advanced imagers in private practice though
10. u/Normal_News_1080 [score=2, created=2025-01-01T14:42:48]: I personally prefer smaller group practices whether hospital employed or private. I have never worked academia but don’t like the idea of having to do conferences routinely and research. That’s what makes doing an mri year to me feel like a waste. Especially if majority of jobs for advanced imaging are at larger academic groups. Are there academic jobs that don’t expect conferences and research but rather taking on residents and fellows only?
11. u/PNW-heart-dad-5678 [score=1, created=2024-12-29T21:15:52]: You described my current job. I had a six month “advanced imaging” block my third year. We did nuc, CT, and dabbled at MRI. My cofellow went on to do a dedicated MRI fellowship and he felt like it took a year or two feel confident at it. I had no interest in MRI. I felt well trained to do CT on my own. Now as someone who is hiring and looking for cardiologists I’m looking for people who do echo, TEE, nuc, and ct. that’s it. We have an mri guy and he gets some protected time for it. I do mostly outpatient and love it.
12. u/Cautious-Map-9568 [score=1, created=2025-01-01T22:12:11]: I will choose 2 years one and I like TEE
13. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=1, created=2025-01-10T04:16:21]: No.
