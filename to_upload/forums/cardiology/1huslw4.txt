===============================================================================

As the time nears on deciding General vs IC, hoping to get input from current attendings on call burden (how often, description of an average night in the life) and how this has affected your relationship with your spouse (such as sleeping arrangements, division of home/child duties, etc). Thank you all.

There’s like never anything you get called about that requires you to go in physically. General groups also tend to be larger than subspecialty groups so you’re on call less frequently. It really also depends on how well the group and the on call system is set up. We have a great answering service and strong ED and IM. I’m on maybe two or three times a month and the max I’ve gotten called overnight was like 3x. Calls are like pts worried about their BP or med refills, ED calling about whether they should admit a patient. Anything that smells like ACS gets paged to IC.
2. u/docmahi [score=13, created=2025-01-06T06:59:26]: Im IC in PP My call is about 1 in 8. I do tend to sleep in the guest bedroom on call nights more so I don't wake up my wife. I dont always get called in but you usually do always get some calls to go over an EKG or something like that. Morning after call if its a weekend my wife usually gets the kids up and lets me sleep in, if its a weekday then I'm usually up anyways getting ready for work.
3. u/No_Paramedic_2039 [score=10, created=2025-01-06T09:09:43]: General Cardiologist here in a large single specialty group. There are a number of things that have vastly improved my QOL over the years. Most recently, the best thing was limiting our practice coverage to a single large hospital. On call frequency is less though it’s quite busy when we’re on. If you have a PA with you, even better. As a noninvasive doc, it’s great to be at a hospital with a STEMI team, solid ER, fellows and intensivists. The IC even covers emergency temporary pacemakers so once I go home, it’s remarkably unlikely to have to come back in. Yes we get overnight phone calls and maybe some ECGs to look at but not having to go in is priceless. You’ll make very good money as a noninvasive doc in a good practice. Unless you have a real passion to do IC and are willing to literally lose sleep over it, I’d say the noninvasive route is preferable. Btw my wife is a doc and doesn’t mind the occasional middle of the night phone calls since my on call frequency is not bad at all.

It’s hard to give up IC once you’re there but it’s harder to convince myself it’s worth it in today’s world. Unless you’re at a small hospital with minimal hospitalist support and a non supportive ER than general cards call would be a breeze for me in most current day employed set-ups.
5. u/imjustawatcher [score=9, created=2025-01-06T14:44:46]: General Cardiology - secured a job with no call or weekends. Life is great, relationship stronger than ever. Could not recommend this setup highly enough.
6. u/doctaco36 [score=8, created=2025-01-06T06:57:19]: As an IC I can tell you calls are much more busy than general because at least where I work, anything remotely urgent is routed to me, heart failure, chest pain, ecg lookup etc. That said we sleep in same bed and it’s amazing how my wife’s brain filters out the phone calls and beeping… If your sig other is a light sleeper, may need different rooms once a week or so
7. u/cardsguy2018 [score=9, created=2025-01-06T10:18:02]: Gen cards. Call q7. I've never been bothered overnight. Maybe a call here or there after dinner. Never have to go in. Part of this is probably hospitalist, ED and hospital culture and hospital size. Obviously has had zero effect on home life. Edit: Also to add, it's not just nights but days and the cath lab. It can be unpredictable. Cases can run long, cases can be delayed, there can be add-ons, etc.
8. u/kgeurink [score=6, created=2025-01-06T21:35:44]: I'm an ic- q5 call at a medium sized hospital. It's not bad at all. I don't do general call. Stemi about 40% of calls. I just go in and do the stemi. Don't get bothered about other nonsense. My wife doesn't wake up at all. We have two small children and it is largely a non issue.
