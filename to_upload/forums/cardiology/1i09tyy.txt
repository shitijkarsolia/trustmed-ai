Hi everyone, I’m planning to sit for the EACVI TTE exam this June and would love some advice. For those who’ve taken the exam, what study materials, books, or resources did you find most helpful? Also, if you have any tips for preparing, strategies for the day of the exam, or things to watch out for, I’d really appreciate your insights! Thanks in advance! 😊

If so “Questions, Tricks, and Tips for the Echocardiography Boards” by Sorrell et al was what I used. A lot of practice questions with detailed explanations of the answers. I actually enjoyed it. It was more than enough and I wouldn’t really recommend anything extra. This was in 2020 I believe so things shouldn’t have changed too much. Good luck!

3. u/CodingMeez [score=1, created=2025-01-18T00:23:02]: I sat for the exam back in 2008 😱 When it was called the EAE (European association of echocardiography). It's still the same as I currently act as the supervisor for colleagues looking to enter the exam. My tips: If you have been working echos for over 3 years it'll be a piece of cake. The difficult part is the physics of course. I recommend Catherine Otto's short book Review Guide. Good luck
