===============================================================================

Hello everyone, I am a PGY2 IMG from a community hospital interested in cardiology fellowship. I have completed MPH and did postdoc in CV imaging at JHU. I cowrote a grant, have publications and did many oral presentations at AHA and ACC as well. I am now set to do away rotation at few places. I am also part of ACC IM cardiology program. Also received few awards, recently, best intern award in my program. My red flags though: community program, visa requiring, step 1 attempt but passed the rest. I need some guidance and advice from fellows and cardiologists. 1. What do you think are my chances of matching? I am not picky with location or program. 2. What should I do to maximize my chances? 3. I have a possible away rotation that I can schedule in the month of Oct- Nov in an university program. Is that a good time to do an away rotation? I am not sure if it will help me get IV at that program this 2026 cycle. Would there still be a chance for them to give me an IV or better yet rank me, if I do well, ofcourse? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you for your time.

2. u/one_plain_slice [score=7, created=2025-01-15T19:03:16]: Remember to apply very broadly (as broadly as you can afford), and emphasize the research/imaging niche hard on all your apps/interviews. Having mentors call/email will be huge. Good luck!
3. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2025-01-16T09:19:42]: Make sure to use your connections. Reaearch, experience etc means nothing nowadays compared to good connections. If you have any advantages (less presented minority, female, family, etc) use that as well.

The only way you are going to know the answer to your question though is empirically by applying to essentially every single program. The other option would be for you to do something like a HF hospitalist year. I've seen this many times really boost a candidate. Most HF fellowships for instance do not fully match and so you can usually fill in for manpower purposes. That can have a really positive effect on your app.
