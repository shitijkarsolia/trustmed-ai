===============================================================================

I am a first year fellow with plans of doing non-invasive cardiology. Are there people like me that struggle in the cath lab ? I am having difficulty getting access even with ultrasound and I just seem to look stupid in the eyes of the interventional cardiologist that I am having anxiety just being in the cath lab. I am always ready to try but nothing seems to be working. I am hoping to just get my 100 caths and just call it good but I just feel terrible that I am being judged by this. I am okay otherwise, i study hard and always been in the 90% percentile in all my ITE’s including ACC ITE

So one of his colleague in internal medicine posting while trying to have an internal jugular vein puncture created a pneumothorax and unfortunately that patient died. So after this incident he was very heavily criticized in the department for his setback. So basically he was so demoralized that he was left with only two options either never to try again for IJV puncture or become a master of it. He chose the second part and from the very next day he attempted as much as IJV puncture as possible. By the end of the year he was almost perfect at it. So choices are clear my friend. Choose wisely. Take care.

4. u/FeedMeBeets [score=11, created=2025-01-28T09:56:17]: Congratulations on getting through the first half of first year. Just like most things there’s a bell curve when it comes to natural hand eye coordination in the cath lab. But also like most things, we all get better with experience. If you’re able to, I’d use the through and through technique with an ultrasound. I’d probably work with the techs and attendings to make sure you’re applying the ultrasound correctly, approaching the artery at the right angle and pulling back at the right velocity. Your upper levels may have more specific advice.
5. u/astrofuzzics [score=8, created=2025-01-28T10:03:06]: I struggled to do it until I started feeling the pulse with the pad of my left thumb rather than with the tips of my index/middle/ring fingers. Once I got used to using my left thumb, which I place oriented along the long axis of the artery, I got better at aiming the puncture needle. The dogma of “don’t use your thumb to check a pulse because it has its own pulse” is wrong, and the pad of your thumb has a lot of nerve endings for good spatial resolution to feel the position of the pulse. Try a different technique. Edit: this applies to radial access. Femoral access, in my opinion, should be done with ultrasound and radiographic verification of femoral head position unless there are extenuating circumstances.

A lot of times if you are cool with the staff they will point out mistakes you are about to make before you make them so you dont feel stupid. Give yourself a break because most first year cardio fellows struggle in cath.
7. u/jgarmd33 [score=6, created=2025-01-28T10:36:14]: This is normal. Trust me it happens to all of us.
8. u/doc2025 [score=4, created=2025-01-28T13:35:24]: It takes a full 3 years for most people who are interested in IC to finally get a hang of it. Just keep practicing if you want to learn.
9. u/FlimsyPope [score=5, created=2025-01-28T17:07:04]: Practice with the ultrasound Spend time with the vascular techs Ask senior fellows for their thoughts It takes time When I start in the 1980s it was all groin Change to radial 2012 Not easy just takes practice This is what fellowships are for
10. u/[deleted] [score=4, created=2025-01-28T14:16:39]: I've worked with consultants (attending?) who even with 30yrs experience just go straight for the femoral because it's easier. Stick with it, you'll get there! Simulation and practice is your friend in almost everything
11. u/cmb1313 [score=3, created=2025-01-28T19:20:40]: My approach for femoral - pin the artery down with your first and second finger on the left hand, and make sure the pad of your right hand on the fifth digit side rests on the thigh so it is supported, stable and doesn’t move. It probably takes 50 catheterizations to have a vague idea of what you’re doing and 150 to get fairly decent at it. Funny story, we used to use only multipurpose catheters. One day when I was attempting to access the ostium of the right coronary artery, my attending, a short but tough French Canadian, who had saved more lives than anybody else in the city, snapped in his French Canadian accent STOP! Then he said “what is it you are doing?” I told him I was trying to get into the right coronary artery. He replied, “either you are lying, or you don’t know what the fuck you are doing…which is it?” By the end of my fellowship, a couple of years later, he was giving me his box seats to baseball games and asked me to stay on staff.
12. u/lhagins420 [score=3, created=2025-01-28T11:10:54]: this is normal. i’ve worked with attendings that still had issues, and we’d all hold our breath but at the end of the day we are all on the same team and we all want you to succeed. I promise that no one is like “wtf”…some patients are harder to access too.
13. u/agnosthesia [score=3, created=2025-01-28T20:53:42]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoPxLxhoufE This is regarding central lines, but the bullseye technique and the angle between probe and needle are still salient. (Recommend you 2x it). Keep going!
14. u/BookishDoc20 [score=3, created=2025-01-29T11:32:14]: Literally are you me? Minus the scores I’m more of a bum, but I feel you in the lab. I just want to be an imager. I felt like I was better with my hands in the MICU than I am in the cath lab right now.
15. u/docmahi [score=4, created=2025-01-28T15:37:29]: I'm IC It took me two weeks to be able to get reliable radial access - it just takes time. I came into cards thinking 100% I would be an advanced imager but ended up falling in love with the cath lab, but for me it did take some time to build the confidence. Dont stress - just keep at it

18. u/mahesoo [score=1, created=2025-10-27T19:00:12]: Hello, I’m a cardiologist from a developing country, and I’m currently doing my interventional cardiology training in China (I was sent here by my government). I’m also struggling, especially because I don’t speak Chinese, which makes communication quite difficult. I’ve been having trouble performing radial punctures and coronary angiography. The situation is quite challenging since I’m only given a short time to complete an angiography — if I fail within 15–20 seconds, they immediately take over. Do you have any tips on how to engage the Left and Right Coronary Ostium more quickly, especially when using a TIG catheter?
