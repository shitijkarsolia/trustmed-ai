Hi guys, as title says I am a Canadian Cardiology fellow. Was wondering how favorable Canadian grads are looked at in the Interventional Cardiology ERAS match, particularly for a top 10 program, ex. Cleveland Clinic, etc. I am pretty good in the research front, but not sure if coming from Canada / not having US connections / STEP scores will be a major hinderance? thanks,

1. u/KtoTheShow [score=8, created=2025-02-01T18:49:24]: IC Fellowship is primarily selected from internal candidates followed by strong professional relationships. Cath lab directors and PDs etc call each other for IC fellowship. There is now a match, which will may make it more challenging to match coming from Canada.

3. u/wunsoo [score=1, created=2025-02-05T06:02:01]: Forget the “top 10” programs. What are you actually trying to learn? I’m sure most of us here can point you in the direction of great community programs that will actually let you touch a catheter and not be the fellow running the manifold.
