Hello! I've got a question for cardiologists. I'm studying for the MIR and I encountered this question while studying the EKG. We're taught that the initial septal depolarization vector points downward and rightward. Following basic ECG principles, when a vector points toward a lead, it should produce a positive deflection (R wave). So why do the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which "look up" at the heart, typically show small Q waves instead of an initial R wave?

1. u/Onion01 [score=12, created=2025-02-05T08:33:25]: The “perfect” inferior lead won’t show a septal Q wave because the depolarization vector is perpendicular to the lead. But the truth is that most hearts are a little rotated and you may capture some septal forces heading towards the inferior leads.
