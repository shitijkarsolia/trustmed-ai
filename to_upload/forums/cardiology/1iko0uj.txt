===============================================================================

Wanted to ask y'alls opinions on how many boards a gen cardiologist really has to take. General boards of course, and by now echo and nuc are pretty much becoming mandatory. What about all these extraneous ones? CT and RPVI? A lot of the 2nd and 3rd years at my program are creating a lot of hysteria by saying you absolutely need these boards to get a job. But i'm pushing back on that. If you're going private practice reading CTs and vascular studies isn't worth it. You make more money seeing patients or reading nucs. Also the private practice group has to have access to a CT scanner. And even with CT who reads the extra-cardiac findings? I can see interventional fellows doing RPVI, but i don't really think it's worth it for general fellows. Maybe if you join a practice that has vascular doctors you can diversify the workload and read those studies? But in all honestly they're gonna give you the boring, tedious, poorly reimbursed ones. Speaking to recent fellows who have graduated and gone into work CT and RPVI isn't something sought out after in private practice or academics (where you'll have either imaging trained cardiologist, radiologist or vascular surgeons handling those studies). To me it just seems like high school again where everyone was saying they're taking 20+ AP classes and some were nonsensical ones you never used like AP Human Geography. But based on my googling, talking to some graduated fellows and attendings in the private practice world outside of echo and nuc, you don't really need to take other boards.

2. u/cardsguy2018 [score=15, created=2025-02-08T08:25:52]: I'm hospital employed. I only use my general and echo boards. I stopped reading nucs pretty much right away because I hardly order them and have no interest in it, I just send it to my colleague. That was an unnecessary $1k board exam right there. CT/MRI goes to rads. RPVI goes to vascular. Pretty much any board exam can be done after you get your job and you see what you'll actually need or want to do. Moreover, consider that even what you want to do may not have the volume to support board recertification down the road. Good on you for doing your research and pushing back on what clueless fellows (and even academic attendings) say.
3. u/pantless_doctor [score=10, created=2025-02-08T07:58:00]: In my opinion it allows more options for you. It’s not necessary but maybe you find a perfect job and they “only need a ct reader” or vascular. Who knows. For what it’s worth rpvi is super easy and can be taken any time. My work paid for mine as I took it after I started working. Also I think ct will become just ubiquitous as spect in the future so you might want that even if you don’t use it or need it for your first job. Most people only stay in first job a few years statistically.
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-02-08T22:27:10]: You need general boards. In some places/states, you need nuc boards to read MPIs. In some practices this is important or lucrative. You probably still won’t “need” it (partners can read these) but they can be beneficial. Most hospitals and systems do not require echo board certification. Some do. CT and RPVI only make sense if you want to do those. I bot board certified in all of these things. I only “use” the echo boards and none of the places that I read or TEE at actually require me to have them. I did very briefly use nuc boards.
5. u/creamasteric_reflex [score=2, created=2025-02-08T10:37:02]: I didn’t do echo because I hate math haha but did nuclear and rpvi just because they were easy to get with my program. I am Fully credentialed to read echo and do tee without echos boards as I did enough in fellowship and therefore didn’t want to spend the money or agony on echo boards. Each place you work will be different but in my group I’m able to read vascular and my partners read ct. however as others have posted those are delegated to vascular surgery or radiology respectively at some places. Just do what you like
6. u/TomNgMD [score=2, created=2025-02-09T18:32:35]: I have ct, nuc, echo and rpvi. I did them mainly to further my knowledge base and obtain everything possible out of fellowship Only general board is truly necessary The extra imaging boards help with deeper understanding of the imaging modalities and help you read betters. Depend on your job you might not able to utilize all these boards, for example i cant read ct because radiology control them, but the ct board help me to review the images myself
7. u/Ornery_Jell0 [score=1, created=2025-02-08T10:47:02]: Minimum echo and nuke. If you can do RPVI, it is worth it and is easy $$$ (many places vascular reads and won’t let cards fellows get numbers/sign off)
8. u/TheCVascularGuy [score=1, created=2025-02-09T18:39:31]: I think for gen cards, get the echo and nuclear, however it depends where u gonna work. Some hospitals, u won’t read the nuc and also it doesn’t require echo board, so doesn’t make sense u get these boards and u won’t use them.
9. u/jiklkfd578 [score=1, created=2025-02-08T09:52:39]: I personally would do everything I could to at least get CT numbers but would also try and get CT boards as well. I guess people basically have to do echo these days which is stupid. I would personally wait on nuc boards and only take it if I was at a weird hospital that required it and that wasn’t flat salary. Nuc is just easy money/rvus
