===============================================================================

So I feel like I know the answer already, but wanted to pick the thoughts of the group. USMD, intern at a mid tier academic IM program. Step 1: P, Step 2: 253, Step 3: 220 Step 3 is below average. Will this be a deterent to matching Cardiology, assuming I do the research and make decent connections w good LORs? Also just in general, how do you make "connections" in the industry besides those that are just in your program? Or is it usually just connections within the program? Thanks!

I never had any luck with networking and “making connections” so I have no insight there, other than getting to know the folks at your own institutions and going to conferences with them so they can introduce you to other industry folks? That’s the best I’ve got.
2. u/soysizle [score=12, created=2025-02-19T14:58:27]: I had an info session with a cards PD recently and he said sometimes a really good step 3 score will usually help very little, but generally average and even below average will not hurt your chances too much. “We just assume you guys passed it”
3. u/hello_there2125 [score=8, created=2025-02-19T15:35:18]: I matched with lower scores, you’re fine
4. u/doogiehouser-08 [score=6, created=2025-02-19T18:29:44]: Home PD for a top cards program telling us factors they look at was basically like “what’s step 3?” and said any of the steps are of no/minimal influence as long as you pass
5. u/KtoTheShow [score=5, created=2025-02-19T15:11:13]: Connections are made through collaborating on projects either at your institution or across institutions. They can be leveled up at conferences/meetings
6. u/Ornery_Jell0 [score=3, created=2025-02-19T16:54:58]: No one cares about Step 3
7. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=2, created=2025-02-19T20:59:18]: I don't think many programs care about step 3 scores.
8. u/Gold-Solution1066 [score=2, created=2025-02-25T22:25:01]: I am below those scores and matched!
9. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=1, created=2025-02-19T20:59:25]: I don't think many programs care about step 3 scores.

11. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-02-20T10:27:03]: I wouldn't sweat about connections outside your program. Just be an excellent resident, do multiple cards rotations, identify strong LOR writers, connect with your cards attendings, fellows and upper residents going into cards. Everyone talks, not just attendings.
