Hi everyone! I'm currently preparing for the ESC Heart Failure HFA Certification exam and would love to hear from those who have successfully navigated this process. Specifically, I'm interested in any tips and recommended resources or materials Any pitfalls to avoid during preparation I've reviewed the official guidelines and curriculum, but personal experiences and insights would be incredibly valuable. Thanks in advance for your help!

You definitely need to know the latest ESC heart failure guidelines (kind of by heart) and learn about the most important heart failure trials. Don't forget to have a good idea about devices, hemodynamics, ventilation.
