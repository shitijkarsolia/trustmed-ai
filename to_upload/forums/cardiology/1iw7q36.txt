As the title states, any ideas on how to be better on reading echo’s? In particular, how can new fellows improve on identifying valvular pathology, interpreting various CW/PW dopplers, and diastology? Appreciate any advice and tips.

It’s critical to get feedback on your reads, it really all comes down to volume, if you’ve seen 100 prosthetic aortic or mitral valves and have googled parameters for stenosis 100x you’ll be better than when you’ve looked at just one. Same with diastology. Literally just put whatever search term and then “echo” or “echo parameters” and in google images the ASE stuff should pop up.
4. u/gatorblazerdoc [score=10, created=2025-02-23T07:58:54]: Pick one set of ASE guidelines, read through it, and apply it to the echos you’re reporting. Focus on putting those guidelines into practice and becoming comfortable with them before trying to tackle everything else. Some attendings would say, “For these two days, just focus on really mastering chamber quantification.” Once you become proficient in that, move on to valves, prosthetic valves, diastology, pericardial disease, and so on. As you progress through the different ASE guidelines, you continue building your skill set until you’re comfortable reading the whole study. It’s also helpful to do bedside echos while on call—make your own assessment first, then compare it to the official report. You can scan with the echo techs and do the same comparison. Once you’re comfortable with interpretation, work on efficiency. Develop a systematic approach for each echo so you can mentally check off key findings as you go. If you follow the same process every time, you’ll reduce the risk of missing anything. Most importantly, make sure that everything makes physiological sense. Echo findings should align with the clinical picture. If something seems inconsistent, take a closer look. For example, if you’re seeing severe mitral regurgitation but the left atrium isn’t enlarged, reconsider your measurements—was PISA measured correctly? Was the LA measured on-axis? Double-check to confirm it all “makes sense”. Finally, ASE has an app called EchoGuide, which includes all the guidelines along with built-in calculators to help you out. It’s a great resource that I still use daily to double-check myself. Bonus: It works in a web browser, so you can pull it up alongside the echo you’re reading.

6. u/astrofuzzics [score=2, created=2025-02-23T09:36:55]: Read a textbook and make sure you understand the fundamentals. I recommend Jay Oh’s book. There’s a chapter in there called “Color and Doppler.” It’s chapter 4 in my edition but probably a different chapter in a more updated edition. It’s very dense material but it’s important to understand those concepts as a base foundation for the rest of your interpretations. I also think the American Society of Echo board prep videos, as well as the Mayo board prep videos, have some good instruction, though some of the material is definitely catered for exam-prep rather than didactic instruction. If you read the book and watch the videos and understand everything, you should be on a rock solid foundation to interpret studies.

8. u/xpietoe42 [score=2, created=2025-02-24T10:27:21]: watch ALOT of videos from any teaching files, YouTube, purchase online or anywhere!! It will come when youve seen enough examples!
9. u/Omzdagoat [score=1, created=2025-02-23T09:02:08]: I feel your pain, when I struggled with echoes last year I got ecgwaves which has an echo section and went through that. Also the small echocardiography Washington manual helped a lot. I come from a front loaded program so first year was really busy. Didn’t really have time to watch the videos etc and felt they were above my head. Just keep reading is also a tried and tested method, it will all click eventually. Best of luck from a pgy v suffering through echo board studying
10. u/KtoTheShow [score=1, created=2025-02-23T11:22:35]: I liked starting with the book Echo Made Easy (Kaddoura) before jumping in to any guidelines, ASE guidelines, mayo videos, reading with faculty, etc. You need to walk before you can run.
11. u/BobbyBalmoral [score=1, created=2025-02-25T14:26:12]: Exposure. Keep doing it, and then do it more. As a former trainee, and someone who has since taught trainees, I can promise you that after a time it just clicks. ASE and ESC materials help a bit, but just keep looking at real studies and I promise you it'll come.
12. u/coldcase311 [score=1, created=2025-02-25T18:14:59]: I’m in the boat where getting through volume with feedback on your reads is the best way to go. Our program essentially has an excel echo workbook that has the images for the ASE criteria for valves, ventricular dimensions, etc. The combination of volume with continually referring to this workbook has made my reading better. Now that I’m starting to prepare for echo boards, I can see how this strategy has helped significantly. Cutoffs for stenosis/regurgitation, left atrial size, etc. are all second nature.
13. u/Few-Particular1780 [score=1, created=2025-02-26T05:28:45]: Basically, you’d need to see more Echos to be able to differentiate between different pathologies. It doesn’t all come in one day.
14. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2025-03-01T07:53:36]: Washington University Manual of Echo. Small and concise, the best intro to echo in my opinion. Can easily read it front to back during first 1-2 echo rotations. I never read any of those huge textbooks, but eventually supplemented with Mayo videos, Klein question bank, and some other resources when it came time for echo boards. Passed comfortably.
15. u/Dense_Hamster_1212 [score=1, created=2025-03-01T14:12:02]: Have a read over American Society of Echo (ASE) guidelines for the various pathologies. They outline the various cut-offs for mild, moderate and severe disease which will help when reading reports. Additionally they a provide a good description of the theory behind these cut offs, better than my own (British) society so much so that when training (I'm an echocardiographer) we were adviced to read ASE guidelines more than the British ones and they were educational and technical moreso than the British society guidelines.
