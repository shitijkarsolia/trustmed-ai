Hi everyone, just messaging as I need some advice. I’m straight out of uni having studied science. I have the option to complete either a masters or a graduate entry mbbs. The issue is, before I make a decision I want to know all the areas of cardiology to help steer me towards a specific role allowing me to decide whether or not I should complete a masters or a mbbs. The reason I say this as I have looked at roles such as an echocardiographer which requires only a masters here in the uk. However, before I decide I want to know what roles there are within cardiology in case there is something else I want to do which would require me to take the medical route. Hope this makes sense! Thanks!

1. u/Paranoidopoulos [score=3, created=2025-02-26T12:23:14]: Fairly different roles and commitment levels there… First decide if you want to be a doctor (and all the baggage with it) - not just cardiology - or whether you’d prefer something allied to it (e.g. echocardiographer)
2. u/Dense_Hamster_1212 [score=2, created=2025-03-01T14:03:30]: If you are in the UK and have an interest in a career in Cardiology without becoming a doctor or doing graduate entry medicine, then I would recommend looking into the Scientist Training Program (STP) or the Echocardiographer Training program (ETP). Both are run by the National School of Healthcare Science and Health Education England. On completion of the STP you will have a master's degree in Clinical science, paid for by Health Education England (if I'm not mistaken, but in any case you certainly do not pay for it yourself), and you train on a full band 6 salary. With the degree you are eligible to register with the Health and Care Professional Council as a Clinical Scientist. You cover all the basics of cardiology diagnostics as a cardiac physiologist from ECGs and ambulatory monitoring, to the more advanced cardiac implantable devices and/or echocardiography. You work toward achieving accreditation in either echo or devices which will make you eligible for a band 7 post. Once you have finished your STP training there is nothing stopping you from achieving accreditation in the other specialism if your hospital accommodates the further training. It's 3 years to complete at the hospital in which you obtain a place with block release for the university portion (currently Newcastle Uni and Manchester Metropolitan unis provide the MSc course). This is obviously quite competitive given the pay while you train, and I may be biased as this was the route I took, but it offers an excellent career route with lots of progression and varied opportunities. I currently do 60% echo with the other 40% doing basic pacemaker follow up and implants, cath lab, and I also run a scientist-led rapid access chest pain clinic. The ETP is more direct and a newer programme. You train for 18 months at band 6 focussing solely on gaining skills in echocardiography and achieving British Society of Echocardiography accreditation. This is obviously a quicker route to completion but you do not complete a masters degree, I think it's a diploma level. As such, you cannot register with the Health and Care Professionals Council which somewhat limits career progression opportunities. I do not want to disrespect the ETP or those who have completed it but the clinical knowledge of ETPs varies quite a lot depending on their prior experience. Some have entered the ETP having been cardiographers or physiologists first. Therefore they have good ECG interpretation skills at the very least and some relevant clinical knowledge and experience. While others have entered straight out of a basic science or biomedical science background and, while being technically proficient echocardiographers, lack some even basic ECG knowledge or understanding of the wider clinical implications of a patient's background or their echo findings. I have some colleagues who completed the ETP that are excellent both technically and clinically and others who could not identify barn door atrial flutter on an ECG (a true story) . Being only echo trained also limits any variety within cardiac physiology and with it being quite physically intense on your back neck and shoulders, should you find yourself unable to scan, you don't have much room for manoeuvre elsewhere (unless of course you already come from a cardiac physiology background). For example, I have developed tendonitis in my elbow from when I was scanning more often but I am able to scale back my scanning time to do more pacemaker follow up and implants. I am sorry for the long post but I thought it may benefit any other UK people in a similar position to you who is considering a career in Cardiology but not specifically as a doctor or nurse. It's a wonderful career, we work closely with the doctors, nurses and radiologists, we see patients and have a direct involvement in their care, and have a very good work-life balance (99% mon-fri 9-5 or thereabouts with the exception of call if you are in the cath lab). Feel free to message me OP if there is anything else you would like to know. Good luck with whatever it is you do decide to do anyway!
