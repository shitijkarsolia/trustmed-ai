... specifically as it relates to generally young healthy patients. I get the call semi regularly to "clear a patient for transfer to inpatient psych." Obviously, I never write the words "cleared" anywhere in the medical record, but instead I generally write something like: "If QTc has been below 480ms x2, the patient is no longer [having symptoms relevent to drug in question], and there is no family history of sudden cardiac death then the risk of TdP due to this acute intoxication is very low going forward" I then recommend follow up and repeat ECGs if starting any QT prolonging agent. Do you guys and girls think this is too much? Not enough? I havent been able to find any data or guidelines on this specific scenario.

Cardiology would be smart overall about it and helpful if the patient is in Torsades, but what are they going to do for every patient who snarfs a few benadryl other than have their time wasted?
2. u/Oxford___comma [score=5, created=2025-02-26T16:49:51]: Isn't this a poison control center issue? They're typically very helpful for acute ingestions and complications... I'd imagine they can give guidance on this to inpatient teams?
