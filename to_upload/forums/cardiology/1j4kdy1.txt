===============================================================================

Background: 57 y/o F presenting to outpatient clinic 1 day after acute episode of dyspnea. Unclear if still dyspneic at time of ECG. Patient then had ambulatory monitoring without further episodes and has not had another episode for &gt; 1 year. I came across this ECG in clinic this past month and disagree with the documented interpretation of AF (but not of the patient’s subsequent treatment). Given the regularity and rate, my first thought was atrial flutter, though I’m now considering atypical AVNRT. It’s a nice ECG to catch sinus arrhythmia with a PAC initiating a re-entrant arrhythmia. I would love to hear more insight into this ECG’s interpretation, strictly for my own learning.

1. u/[deleted] [score=26, created=2025-03-05T19:16:05]: Sinus with an AT- and to expand: atypical AVNRT could be in the differential but the RP is too variable to be a fixed pathway in mind. Too much wobble. Also, probability wise suggests AT more likely.
2. u/rsp74 [score=15, created=2025-03-05T19:00:01]: AT vs AFL
3. u/mau5head87 [score=10, created=2025-03-05T21:12:03]: Sinus rhythm with onset of atrial flutter with 2:1 AV conduction. The rate of SVT is approximately 150 bpm which is very suspicious for atrial flutter. Additionally, in the lead II rhythm strip you can see what appear to be flutter waves at the end of the QRS complex which were not present during sinus rhythm. AVNRT is less likely as it is generally faster (around 160 - 180 bpm) and there is no consistent pseudo R'
4. u/ceelo71 [score=6, created=2025-03-05T23:24:58]: Looks like an atrial tachycardia which eventually stabilizes with 2:1 AV conduction. The rate could be typical atrial flutter but the atrial activation in lead II doesn’t not have the characteristic sawtooth pattern. Unlikely to be atypical AVNRT as it appears to have A&gt;V. Also, another clue is that there isn’t PR prolongation with the initial PAC, which indicates engagement of the slow pathway (seen in typical AVNRT and usually in ORT).
5. u/One_Fruit_8876 [score=2, created=2025-03-06T11:41:32]: It is common AVNRT (slow-fast), it starts with little PR jump (prolongation) and during SVT in V1 lead you can see pseudo r' wave after QRS (short RP)

7. u/ItsObvious_c_it [score=0, created=2025-07-17T22:22:00]: I’m back with another AI summary, this time from Grok4. Thoughts? AI seem to be getting better? Interesting ECG! Definitely not AF—the rhythm is regularly regular with a ventricular rate around 150 bpm, which rules out the irregularly irregular pattern of AF. The narrow QRS complexes point to a supraventricular origin. Looking at the rhythm strips (V1, II, V5), it starts with a few sinus beats showing some variability (sinus arrhythmia?), followed by what looks like a PAC—note the early, slightly different P wave morphology—then abrupt onset of the tachycardia. This sudden initiation is classic for a re-entrant mechanism. ￼ No gradual acceleration like sinus tach. For atrial flutter: The rate fits (atrial ~300 bpm with 2:1 AV block giving ~150 ventricular), but I don’t see the telltale sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF)—the baseline looks pretty isoelectric there. ￼ In V1, there might be some subtle notching, but it’s not convincing for the upright flutter waves you’d expect in typical counterclockwise flutter. ￼ If it were flutter with variable block, it’d be irregular, but this is rock-steady regular. That leaves re-entrant SVT, and AVNRT seems spot-on. During the tachycardia, P waves aren’t clearly visible before the QRS, suggesting they’re either buried in the QRS or retrograde right after. Check V1: there’s a small positive deflection at the end of the QRS (pseudo-r’ wave?), which is a hallmark of typical slow-fast AVNRT where retrograde conduction up the fast pathway hides the P in or just after the QRS (short RP interval). ￼ No long RP with inverted P waves post-QRS like in atypical fast-slow AVNRT. ￼ Could be orthodromic AVRT (via accessory pathway), but that’s less common in a 57 y/o without pre-excitation on baseline ECG (assuming no delta waves here), and the pseudo-r’ leans more toward AVNRT. ￼ Junctional tachycardia is possible but usually doesn’t initiate with a PAC like this. Clinically, the single episode of dyspnea, no recurrence after &gt;1 year, and ambulatory monitoring clean—all fits paroxysmal SVT. Treatment-wise, if it was misread as AF, they might’ve considered anticoagulation unnecessarily, but good that you agree with the management (observation? beta-blockers?). If this were in clinic, adenosine would’ve been diagnostic: it’d likely terminate AVNRT abruptly or unmask flutter waves if present. ￼ Great case for learning—thanks for sharing!

9. u/ItsObvious_c_it [score=-31, created=2025-03-05T19:38:14]: Just posted it to grok and here is what it said: I can help analyze this 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram) and provide a detailed description based on my knowledge. However, I must emphasize that I am not a medical professional, and this analysis is for informational purposes only. A qualified cardiologist or physician should always be consulted for an accurate diagnosis and interpretation of an ECG. ECG Analysis and Description General Overview: This is a standard 12-lead ECG, displaying the electrical activity of the heart from different angles. The leads are labeled as follows: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1 through V6. Each lead provides a unique perspective of the heart’s electrical activity, helping to identify abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, and potential ischemic changes. Key Observations: 1 Rhythm and Rate: ◦ The rhythm appears regular, with consistent R-R intervals across all leads. ◦ To estimate the heart rate, we can use the “300 rule” (dividing 300 by the number of large squares between two consecutive R waves). In lead II, there are approximately 5 large squares between R waves, suggesting a heart rate of about 300 ÷ 5 = 60 beats per minute (bpm). This is within the normal range (60–100 bpm). 2 P Waves: ◦ P waves are visible before each QRS complex, indicating sinus rhythm (the normal electrical impulse originates from the sinoatrial node). ◦ The P waves appear upright in leads I, II, and aVF, which is consistent with a normal sinus rhythm. 3 PR Interval: ◦ The PR interval (from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex) appears to be within the normal range of 120–200 ms (3–5 small squares). Measuring in lead II, it looks to be around 4 small squares (160 ms), which is normal. 4 QRS Complex: ◦ The QRS duration appears normal, less than 120 ms (3 small squares). In lead II, the QRS complex spans about 2 small squares (80 ms), which is within normal limits. ◦ There is no evidence of a bundle branch block (which would widen the QRS complex). 5 ST Segment and T Waves: ◦ The ST segments in most leads appear to be at baseline (isoelectric), which is normal. There is no significant ST elevation or depression that would suggest acute ischemia or infarction. ◦ T waves are upright in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, and V3–V6, which is normal. In leads V1 and V2, the T waves are slightly inverted, which can be normal in these leads, especially in healthy individuals (particularly younger patients or those with a rightward axis). 6 Q Waves: ◦ There are no significant pathological Q waves (deep and wide Q waves that might indicate a prior myocardial infarction). Small Q waves in leads III and aVF may be normal, especially if they are less than 1 small square wide and less than 25% of the R wave height. 7 Axis: ◦ The electrical axis can be estimated by looking at the QRS complex in leads I and aVF. ▪ Lead I: The QRS is predominantly positive. ▪ Lead aVF: The QRS is also predominantly positive. ◦ This suggests a normal axis (between 0° and +90°), which is typical in healthy individuals. 8 Leads V1–V6 (Precordial Leads): ◦ There is a normal R-wave progression across the precordial leads (V1–V6). The R wave amplitude increases progressively from V1 to V4/V5, and the S wave diminishes, which is a normal finding. ◦ No evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) based on the R and S wave amplitudes. 9 Other Findings: ◦ There are no obvious signs of arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia. ◦ No evidence of Brugada syndrome (coved-type ST elevation in V1–V3) or long QT syndrome (QT interval appears within normal limits, though exact measurement would require more precise calculation). Summary: This ECG appears to show a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 60 bpm. The PR interval, QRS duration, and ST segments are within normal limits. The axis is normal, and there is appropriate R-wave progression in the precordial leads. There are no obvious signs of acute ischemia, infarction, or significant arrhythmias. The slight T-wave inversion in V1–V2 may be a normal variant, especially in younger individuals or those with a more vertical heart position. Recommendations: While this ECG appears largely normal, a few points should be considered: • If the patient has symptoms (e.g., chest pain, palpitations, or syncope), further evaluation may be warranted, even with a normal ECG. • Comparison with previous ECGs (if available) can help identify subtle changes over time. • Clinical correlation is essential—factors like age, medical history, and symptoms should guide further interpretation. If you’d like a more detailed analysis (e.g., exact measurements of intervals or comparison with specific criteria for conditions like LVH), or if you have additional context about the patient, let me know! I can also search for more information if needed to refine the interpretation. However, for a definitive medical diagnosis, please consult a healthcare professional.
