Hi there! Was wondering if there are any folks who were non-traditional students or older students who pursued Cardiology and/or IC? What was it like? Can you share some bits about your experience? *Either career changed and entered medical school or took a five year gap + before starting medical school or maybe even took time off during medical school as examples by non-traditional *

By the time I finish IM residency will be 37 goin to 38, but I plan to pursue cards. So when I’m done we are looking at 40/41 as a general cards attending or 42/43 as IC. FYI, I was a nurse for 7 years before med school. Not sure if this is what you mean nontrad

What is interesting to learn is how FEW physicians (in the USA) actually follow a completely "traditional" pathway (I am not one of them). In general, having a unique experience/career and still being able to perform well enough to get into medical school and cardiology fellowship is considered a very good thing. It also, IMO, allows for better perspective when practicing (either a unique skill set or simply an understanding of "adult life outside of medicine").

7. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-03-12T08:39:07]: What exactly are you looking for? I took a couple years off myself which is hardly non-trad but I've met or trained with folks from all walks of life. As long as you understand the financial math, age is mostly just a number.

I finished cards fellowship at 37. Now practicing non invasive cards with great work life balance and plenty of money. Other than an even later start at saving good amounts I am happy I did it.
