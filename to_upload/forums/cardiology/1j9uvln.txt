2. u/[deleted] [score=32, created=2025-03-12T14:54:52]: The easiest way to identify the important ones are the trials cited in the guidelines. Take a look at this Anki deck of the ~150 most important trials. https://www.mediafire.com/file/xblatqx9syq64ic/ROMA_deck_v2.4.apkg/file

Now To compare it with previous study ask open evidence to look for similar trial in the past. you can be as detailed as you want at any level (e.g you can ask to compare inclusion criteria of X amount of trial or to make a table of their outcomes, of course it's advised to double check) . If you have more time you can get all the articles/trials of choice and put it into AI app like notebook LM and ask it direct question, I usually do that will guidelines, and it will only try to answer from that documents. You don't have to do the above more that once a month and it will take you less than 30 min if you are just skimming.
