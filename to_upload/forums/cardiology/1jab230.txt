===============================================================================

So I’m about to head into application season, but feel like my CV isn’t strong enough to where I want it. I do have good Letters of REC and can even get more. My program is I only giving me 2 weeks of externship. My residency program is in a community hospital that is very Cards/CC Centric and the patient population is sick. Im not we’ll published either because I really work so much and have many found time. Should I do a year of CardioHospitalist build up my CV and then apply or go for it this year with just Good letters and minimal away rotation? Edit: want to go for IC

I will say that your step 1 and 2 scores are great however step 3 (assuming typo and meant 210) does raise a red flag bc of how different it is from your priors. Having said that, I think PDs are viewing applicants on a much more holistic basis and board scores don’t really matter as much as used to. Regarding research, that will depend on the “academic rigor” of the programs you apply to. If you want to match at a community center then I think quality &gt;&gt;&gt; quantity of research. Would focus on making more connections and reaching out to programs of interest and I would not recommend doing a cardiohosp if you can avoid it. I see no reason why you wouldn’t at least try to apply cards this season and see where the winds take you. Best of luck!!

3. u/pill-ow_talk [score=1, created=2025-03-13T07:40:50]: Definitely apply. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
4. u/TheWizardPenguin [score=1, created=2025-03-13T16:20:33]: I would advocate to take some time off. Programs know who applied again and if applicants don't get in anywhere, questions start getting asked. As you move away from medical school, it actually becomes less meritocratic in some senses. Scores don't matter as much. I would say two top things we used to look for. #1) where you did your training. #2) who you knew. I can't remember how many spots were given out or filled just because someone well knows called our PD or one of our senior attending "hey this guy is phenomenal - you have to take him." Certainly, I would say 1/3 of my own interviews immediately came after one of my mentors made a few phone calls. Research is in some ways cherry on top and matters most to those going for top research institutions.
5. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=1, created=2025-03-13T22:57:52]: There are too many variables here to be able to tell you the best course of action. In general, your best shot at matching is after doing well in a residency program or after a chief residency. If you have a good shot, go for it now. In addition to looking at your publications, etc., it's a good idea to take an honest look at the experience previous residents in your program have had in doing cardiology. Cardiac hospitalists jobs can help, but not necessarily as a resume-booster. The biggest impact that they will have is in getting you connected with the local cardiology division.
6. u/Spintroll28 [score=1, created=2025-03-15T03:53:46]: Have you thought about doing a research fellowship? There are quite a few places that offer it and I think you do need a good amount of research ahead of time but some may not require as research intensive or a resume and those could be targets for you to streamline your way into a fellowship after doing research for a year.
7. u/Gold-Solution1066 [score=1, created=2025-03-13T07:34:29]: A year or two of cardiac Hospitalist will help big time. I did 2 years of it and then matched in house
