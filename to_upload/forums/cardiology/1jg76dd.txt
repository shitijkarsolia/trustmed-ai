Hi, looking for advice on what to look/ask for when interviewing for my first job out of fellowship (non invasive). I have a rough idea of base pay is but more so wondering about what would be a normal call/rounding/clinic structure or if there’s any major red flags to be aware of when interviewing. Thank you in advance!!

If you see that people don't last very long in the group, that is a red flag. Avoid. \- Private group where people don't make partner or where there are unequal partners. In a well-run private partnership group nearly everyone should make partner after 1-3 years. If they are quitting before they or not making partner...avoid. Better to be employed elsewhere. \- Any unfair reimbursement schedule. Of course you are paid less before making partner or becoming productive. After that, there should not be a major imbalance. You should be paid--in some way--for the work you do. Avoid places that make sweetheart deals to certain members. Also consider: \- Cardiology practices vary widely. Although there is no "normal" for call and clinic burden, those do tend to say a lot about the attitude of the group. If you are seeing 30 patients a day in the hospital or 40 in clinic, you should be making gobs of $$$ but probably will have very little "down time". \- Don't focus too much on starting salary. Look at what people make 3+ year into practice. That matters a lot more. $100k for the first two years doesn't matter if you are loosing much more than that each subsequent year due to a bad contract. \- No matter what type of practice you join, it is important that you be viewed as a colleague. \- Carefully review contracts. Unless you are completely sure that the contract is fair, review it with an attorney. This matters a lot more in some states. \- If you are "settling" for a short-term job, make sure the contract is appropriate: no cancellation penalty, tail insurance coverage, etc. Sometimes "signing bonuses" are taxable but paying them back if you leave early is also post-tax.

Academic Jobs: • Schedule: 2 clinic days, 2 dedicated imaging days, 1 admin day • Inpatient: ~8–14 weeks/year (mostly consults, fellows typically handle first call) • Call: Fellows cover primarily • Compensation: Salary + RVU; lower $/wRVU and higher thresholds to hit bonuses • PTO: ~4–5 weeks 2. Employed Non-Academic Jobs: • Schedule: 3–4 clinic days, 0.5–1 imaging day/week • Inpatient: ~8 weeks/year; APPs handle first call, you’re backup • Call: APP primary coverage • Compensation: Salary + RVU; higher $/wRVU than academics • PTO: ~5–6 weeks 3. Private Practice: • Schedule: Usually 5 clinic days, imaging integrated into daily workflow (no protected imaging days) • Inpatient: Varies widely based on hospital arrangements (floors, units, or consults) • Call: You or APP; varies greatly • Compensation: Lower initial salary but excellent earning potential after partner track (2–3 years typically), unless acquired by private equity • PTO: Limited initially, but significantly improves after partnership ⸻ Important questions to ask when comparing jobs: • What’s your $ per wRVU conversion rate? • How many wRVUs do most cardiologists produce annually? • Is dedicated imaging time protected and guaranteed? • How many inpatient weeks/year, and is this floors/units or consult-based? • Is there fellow/trainee or APP support? • What’s required to achieve partnership (timeline, financial buy-in)? • What’s the clinical and administrative support like (MA, RN, APP coverage)?

Turnover (including staffing) is the biggest red flag and can mean many things that warrant investigation. Another cocnern is not being particularly open or forthcoming.
4. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2025-03-21T05:09:12]: A lot of variability. Interview or look into a lot of places Generally speaking unless you’re a grinder I wouldn’t go private in today’s world. When looking at employed I would go for the largest group possible. Less call. Less direct administrative communication. Typically more stable/protection within your system. Typically a much more standardized and protected schedule.

7. u/Novel_Chip9652 [score=1, created=2025-03-23T05:00:02]: All of the above plus if a large system with multiple outpatient locations where cardiology sees patients ask to clarify where they would expect to send you for clinic days. If you know where or roughly where you would be living, write into contract the locations you would be agreeable to go to save yourself a possibly much longer commute a few days a week or month. If they arent willing to negotiate that, at minimum that is a useful data point to know
8. u/DrCareerPath [score=1, created=2025-04-08T06:43:03]: Hey there! First off, congrats on wrapping up fellowship, it’s an exciting (and a bit nerve-wracking) time! I totally get wanting to make sure your first job is a good fit. When you’re looking at call, rounding, and clinic structure, it’s all about finding the right balance. For call, you’ll want to know how often you’re expected to be on, and if there’s a good team or support system to help out when things get busy. Same with rounding—make sure you’re clear on how much inpatient work you'll be doing and if there’s a hospitalist team to help with the heavy lifting. As for the clinic, it’s key to understand how patient load works, what the patient base looks like, and what kind of support staff you’ll have. As for red flags, just watch out for vague answers when it comes to expectations around hours, volume, and what kind of backup you’ll have. If anything feels like they’re not being clear on those things, it’s worth digging a bit deeper. That being said, we’re actually looking for a **Non-Invasive Cardiologist** to join a Regional provider in the Greater Atlanta area! It’s a great opportunity if you’re looking for a manageable call schedule, a solid clinic setup, and a supportive team. We’re all about making sure everyone has the right balance of work and life, and we’ve got a strong infrastructure in place to help you thrive. Worst case, it could be great interview skills. If you’re interested, I’d love to chat more about the role and see if it might be a good fit for you. Feel free to reach out anytime! Good luck with everything—hope to hear from you!
