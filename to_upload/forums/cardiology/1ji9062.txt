Focus more on keeping your job and reputation intact (limit complications.. dont take on hard cases early. Don’t pipe up or get yourself in trouble with your bosses). Make sure your job is reasonable in intensity. Make sure you don’t burnout. Make sure you’re getting the best deal in your chosen market.

IRA/401k isn’t enough for saving IMO, many still prioritize due to perception of tax benefits, perhaps moreso if 1099 status and able to contribute $70k with match and employer portion. For me I’ve focused on practice equity (if available), brokerage account (no limit on what you want to have in your portfolio ) to make up the difference, and then opened another practice on the side.
4. u/TheWizardPenguin [score=9, created=2025-03-23T20:55:15]: Two years out now as an IC attending. Most important thing I think is really save save save. It will seem like you're earning a lot but in reality it's not because a lot will go to taxes. So that $500k salary becomes really $300k (roughly after state taxes) before even anything else. And whatever you spend will be taxed again. So save money, live conservatively. Retirement accounts maxed first. Don't buy a house in the first year. Wait until 2 years to see if you like the job - roughly 1/3 of new graduates change jobs after 2 years and you don't want to buy/sell so quickly, you'll lose money.

Tithe and give to charity. Save up a 6 month emergency fund. But during those first six months to a year out, focus on the best practices and guidelines, and pray to stay away from the complications that your attending kept you away from without even knowing it. I agree with the above recommendation to protect your reputation. Make it known that you are thoughtful and that you take advice. This is particularly important because when (not if) complications arise, you want the general consensus to be that “these things happen”, not that you’re reckless and don’t listen. Ask for advice from your senior partners, even if you already know exactly what you’re going to do - for interventional and noninterventional cases. Marry the right partner. Seek God.

Maxed out 401k/457, additional 4 k monthly in brokerage, upped life insurance, disability insurance. I also got a new house, bike, and have taken a couple nice vacations. With ic salary there is more than enough to do all.

As a result I’ve focused on aggressively paying down student loans which has been a good strategy My plan after is to continue to save some as cash, and invest some as well You should also maximize tax advantaged accounts such as a 401k, HSA, etc or as pertains to you. I also set up a back door Roth Again white coat investor has lots of resources
8. u/Live4now [score=3, created=2025-03-23T15:07:30]: I paid down private student loans and also started putting money into Vanguard total stock fund. Once loans were gone I put the extra money into the Vanguard fund. Starting that habit early made it much easier to continue as my income increased.
