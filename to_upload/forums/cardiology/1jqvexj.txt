Interested in learning vein procedures (sclero, ablations). Any books or resources recommended, aside from attending courses?

Some surgeons have an easier time because you can wrap some of the capital costs into the hospital OR budget and over-charge for these services in an OR setting, but if you’re trying to run an ambulatory clinic (where these things should be done) it’s a really big climb now. It’s why a lot of vein clinics have closed or otherwise consolidated. Especially if your payor mix in your area skews Medicare/Medicaid. You need a large steady case volume to even justify the resources you need to getting things set up and done. But if you’re determined and passionate about this space, definitely want to check out a course. VIVA is good, there’s a few vein related vascular courses, NCVH. I don’t do cosmetic vein but truncal vein closures and some clean up branch treatments in the real deal symptomatic patients can be life changing and very rewarding work.
