===============================================================================

Just wanted to see what the experience of other members has been with some private practice contracts. Seems like there are quite a number of usually solo private practices that have adopted the model of churn and burn through new associates. They usually lure people in with promises of partnership offers in 2-3 years. Usually people are worked hard as indentured laborers and then when the time comes for partnership comes they never materialize for one reason or other. The associates then usually have to leave the area due to non competes while the practice hires another victim to start the cycle again. Since there is usually no database of such predatory practices the new person gets sucked into the same trap like hapless mice. Unfortunately such practices seem to be quite common in some areas with no consequences for them. Wondering if other people are aware of similar practices

Just being on call q2 for your groups pts would be brutal.. Similar to hospital employed, the larger the group the better imo. It’s your best protection from a call standpoint and job security standpoint, but even then yes be very careful in what you sign in the PP world.

The partner burned out hard doing q2 call and moved elsewhere and the other guy who owns the practice has been trying to replace him for at least 5-6 years. Every year or so he has someone sign on with the promise of making partner and having 1M+ compensation. After about 6 months they inevitably leave because it is an unrealistic workload. In the interim when it is just the one guy working, he just cuts back on patient load and outsources some of his caths to the bigger group in town and still makes money hand over fist doing outpatient diagnostic caths in his office. Then when he gets someone to work with him he just slams in the volume, almost as if he is trying to squeeze maximum profitability before his partner inevitably quits. It's a very scummy way to do things, but it's also very lucrative apparently.
