Hi everyone, I’m planning to challenge the CSCT test and could use some advice. If anyone has taken the test, I’d love to hear about your experience—any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated. Also, I’m a bit unsure about where to purchase the books listed in the reading materials. If you have any suggestions or know of good places to find them, I’d be grateful for your help. Thanks in advance!
