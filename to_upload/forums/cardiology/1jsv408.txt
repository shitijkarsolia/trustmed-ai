Hi everyone, I'm a general cardiology fellow with a strong interest in electrophysiology. I'm considering staying at my home institution for EP fellowship for several personal and professional reasons. However, one downside is that the program doesn't currently offer exposure to some of the more advanced technologies—for example, it remains largely fluoroscopy-dependent. One of my specific goals is to learn fluoroless techniques. That said, I'm curious how EPs typically learn and adopt newer technologies after completing fellowship. As the field continues to evolve rapidly, I imagine this is a critical—and potentially challenging—aspect of staying current and expanding one’s skill set outside of a structured training program. I’d really appreciate any insights or advice from those who have navigated this in their own careers. Thanks in advance!

A lot of skills you learn in EP translate nicely to new technologies (like PFA isn’t very hard if you do a lot of RFA afib). But I have to say if a program is not using electroanatomical mapping for bread and butter procedures and more fluoro… that might be a tough spot to start from. Is the program doing afib/flutters/EP studies with just fluoro? I can’t even imagine that in 2025.
2. u/Furqan23 [score=7, created=2025-04-06T07:56:48]: They have courses as mentioned As unsolicited advice - EP fellowship is only a couple of years of your life and in my own opinion unless absolutely necessary I would consider programs more in line with what you are looking for training wise Its a potentially short term burden for a long term career Again I know you didn’t ask for that advice but take it for what it’s worth
3. u/changwufei801 [score=6, created=2025-04-06T09:12:59]: The core things you need to get out of fellowship is being able to manipulate different kinds of catheters in the heart and how to differentiate arrhythmias. As long as you are the one with your hands on the catheter/leads during the case and are exposed to a wide variety of cases you will have all the skills you need later for fluoroless - whether it’s for ablation or LAAO. Hands on experience is what you need, not watching your attending do it. Your home program is the only one where you know 100% if that is the training you will get. I know plenty of people who were trained on fluoro in fellowship and transitioned within a month or two of independent practice. Being competent in core skills is what allows for quick adoption of new tech.
4. u/WenckebachMD [score=10, created=2025-04-06T08:10:56]: Going fluoroless is not worth the extra effort it takes. It feels kind of gimmicky to be honest. Not to mention that you’ll need fluoro anyway for devices, extractions, left atrial occlusion devices. If your home program isn’t using a mapping system, i would leave immediately. It is a huge part of EP, similar to fluoro. Just tools you should learn and be comfortable with to get the job done
5. u/Gideon511 [score=3, created=2025-04-06T09:27:21]: The biggest factor in your outcome in terms of the EP you become will be the work you put into it both during and post fellowship. At premier programs you get more exposure to certain things but bread and butter EP you will get anywhere. Research opportunities will be better at a premier institution also. A year does not matter much in the grand scheme of things. Focus on becoming a good general EP is my advice, the rest will take care of itself.
6. u/OriginalLaffs [score=3, created=2025-04-06T12:44:20]: In EP, fellowship is far from the end of learning. As one of my mentors would say: When you’re done fellowship, you’re not ‘good’; you’re ’good enough’. I trained in a program with only one operator pushing fluoro free, and did not go fluoro free consistently as staff until 6 months out from fellowship. FF in particular is easy to build towards- you start off wearing lead but just not touching fluoro, until you’ve done it enough that you are comfortable just not putting on the lead. For Afibs, can start off taking it off only after transseptal until you are comfortable with that part to. If you ever need to, you can always take the time to scrub out, put on lead, and scrub back in. You can also go to other courses, and have people come to proctor you. Industry will be supportive of anything that gets you to use more of their kit.
7. u/Gideon511 [score=2, created=2025-04-06T09:03:22]: I concur very low flouro as good as no flouro, sometimes in a case you do benefit from being able to see with fluoroscopy in my opinion. Different EP programs have strengths and weaknesses, and you can expect to learn new techniques and procedures throughout your career. Personally concur go to the best program you can get into, and let the rest sort itself out later. We use much less fluoroscopy than we used to.
8. u/stromarox [score=2, created=2025-04-06T10:25:33]: I’m relatively new EP staff, graduated a little under two years ago. You’ll find that in the first year you’ll learn more than the second year of your fellowship. I’ve absolutely learned things that I did not even do in fellowship. You talk to your colleagues and mentors to see what they do and then you just give it a try during cases. You can take a few minutes every case to try something different and gradually build a new skill. On topic of fluoroless, I had limited exposure to fluoroless transeptals but I have been asking for tips and trying it out every case with leads on and now the majority I don’t even press the fluoro but it’s there if I need. I agree with the previous comments though re: fluoroless being gimmicky. You can just use your 10-15s of fluoro and then take off your lead afterwards. And as you graduate transition towards flouroless, you can still keep it there as a back up. Just work towards a minimal fluoro. floral.
9. u/haripj99 [score=1, created=2025-04-06T17:14:45]: The first year or so you may not feel comfortable taking in newer skills once you are an EP attending. Then you start gaining confidence and nothing beats experience in making you feel more comfortable. Like others have pointed out any newer techniques have training courses available, some on simulators and some even with cadaver training or animal labs. The zero fluoro thing to me is a marketing gimmick. With the high quality of 3D mapping now available as well as ICE, the amount of X-ray used is very low for ablation. I personally do most of my PFA cases (when just doing PVAI) without mapping and still use around 3-4 min of fluoro. With newer x-ray systems the dose is 20-30 mGy.
10. u/slimelord222 [score=1, created=2025-04-06T14:02:18]: Fluoroless is an industry gimmick. Have been around Plenty of sternotomy due to it. Use fluoro for transseptal puncture. It just takes getting over your skis once in the appendage. My 2 cents
