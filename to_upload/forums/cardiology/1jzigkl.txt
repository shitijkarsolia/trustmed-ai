===============================================================================

Hi, I was wondering if becoming cocats 2 in cardiac CT (without becoming cocats 2 in cMRI) and becoming truly comfortable with reading cardiac CT (TAVR, Coronary CTA, cardiac morph) including non-cardiac findings is seen as beneficial for a cardiology fellow that will be entering the general cardiology market in a year or so. Would be interested in how your answer would change depending on the kind of city/location that I am looking to work in? (Rural vs metro).

2. u/KtoTheShow [score=3, created=2025-04-14T20:55:07]: Probably helpful for your training. Less helpful for a job unless you are going to formally read dedicated CT and MR as part of your job description. This might be more common in a smaller city/community-style practice.
3. u/aethes [score=2, created=2025-04-15T02:45:38]: Just finished the job interview trail. I interviewed at mostly smaller community hospitals. Did not interview at private practice places and did not interview at academic centers. But the places that I interviewed at it was highly desirable. That being said, I am not gonna be coats to CT, so while they would’ve liked it, it was nowhere near a dealbreaker.
4. u/wannaberesident [score=2, created=2025-04-15T07:33:15]: If you’re being trained to read incidentals, TAVRs or any structural CTs, you’re essentially getting into Level 3 territory. Furthermore, structural CTs mean you’re not just reading the heart, but also need to evaluate abdomen, pelvis, and vascular run-off, which can be tricky if you’re coming purely from a cardiology background. Most Level 2 training tends to focus on: • CAC scoring (super straightforward), • Coronary CTA (anatomy + some functional insight), • Pre-PVI or pre-LAAO planning. From what I’ve seen, having CT skills is a good asset especially when applying to non-academic or smaller systems, and even more so in rural settings. A lot of these places want someone who can read coronary CTs, and they typically have radiology back-up for incidentals. Also, owning or having access to a CT scanner can be very lucrative, especially with the new bump in cCTA reimbursement. It’s definitely not a dealbreaker though if you don’t have CT, but it’s also been a nice complement to my nuclear training, especially as we’re seeing more PET and SPECT/CT hybrids. If you’re gunning for a major academic center or big urban health system, though, they’re often expecting Level 3—which usually means an extra year of imaging training.

Unlikely to offer any benefit and more likely to hurt you. Edit: Some bad takes here. And just because a practice is looking for a CT guy doesn't mean it's worth your while.
6. u/Rock50d4 [score=1, created=2025-04-15T04:53:41]: Definitely worth it in private practice, small and large. There will be jobs that would like you to start a Cardiac CT program.
7. u/pills_here [score=1, created=2025-04-15T12:37:01]: It is becoming more desirable as a skillset. More than half the jobs I looked at in the community wanted someone to read coronaries for their group.
8. u/asoutherner33 [score=1, created=2025-04-15T19:13:04]: Probably more valuable now to just get CT boarded given the increased reimbursement for inpatient CCTA than cMRI. If you’re doing general cardiology may be good to have especially if you can be somebody that can read CT hearts for structural CT‘s such as for TAVR/TMVR/LAAO. Every group needs one of those people nowadays. I would not concentrate on cardiac MRI unless you’re going to be at a major academic center and be “that guy” that reads them.
9. u/pantless_doctor [score=1, created=2025-04-16T02:30:46]: I enjoy it. Makes you more desirable and flexible with job offers. I also think helpful conceptually and four your education, even if you don't use it. Also MRI is not necessary at all to doing a good job at CT. Fyi tavr Cta can take a long time per scan. Typically structural will also do their own measurements anyways as well but needs to be done right and carefully. Coronary Cta only take about 10 min if normal.
10. u/jsman25 [score=1, created=2025-04-16T13:47:08]: Like anything, it depends on what you wanna do. However, if you’re interested in CT, getting adequately trained in it during your general fellowship is definitely doable. It can also help you establish a bit more of an “imager phenotype” if that’s what you’re looking to do. I wouldn’t do it solely for marketability.
11. u/prince_veg3ta [score=1, created=2025-04-16T14:26:07]: Would echo what others are saying RE how it can make you desirable to your future employer. I would, however, make sure you actually enjoy reading coronary/structural CTs. If you do, I’d go for it. They will take time away from reading echos and nucs which are performed/read a lot faster, and if you don’t actually enjoy CT that much, I can imagine it becoming an annoying part of your responsibilities very quick.
