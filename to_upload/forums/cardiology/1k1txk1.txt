2. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=12, created=2025-04-17T23:56:32]: I am glad you are interested in cardiology…but it’s still early, so don’t be afraid to explore other fields (even though cardiology really is the best). The top three things you can do now to set yourself up for success… 1. Get into a strong IM program. 2. Get into a strong IM program. 3. Get into a strong IM program. Cardiology fellowship remains competitive. You can train anywhere, but your odds of matching to a cardiology are significantly better if you are coming from a respected academic (or equivalent) program. It’s the difference between “probably going to match” and “probably not going to match”. Try to do well in med school to make this an option. NOTE: for those of you who are not at these top IM programs, I mean no disrespect. You can still match to cardiology. However, as you have likely discovered, you have to excel and put in extra effort (which is very respectable). Other things to do in med school: - Try to get a little exposure to cardiology and other fields that interprets you. - Learn how to read correctly read ECGs. There is no reason to wait until residency to do this.

4. u/KtoTheShow [score=3, created=2025-04-17T20:20:59]: Just focus on doing well in school. Figure out your study habits. As you get closer to M2, can't hurt to reach out to faculty for shadowing, building relationships, etc.
5. u/BigAorta [score=3, created=2025-04-18T04:51:14]: That’s great that you know you want to do cards. A few tips below: - stay open minded. You never know if another specialty will unexpectedly attract you. - learn medicine. The path to cards and any IM subspecialty begins with becoming the best internist. Getting into a rigorous IM program that will expose you to a lot of pathologies will give you an edge - do well on step exam. This is becoming less and less important but depending on where you want to go might have more of an influence - be realistic. Cards is super competitive. Last fellowship cycle USMD match rate for cards was low 80s Best of luck!
