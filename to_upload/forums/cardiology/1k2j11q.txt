===============================================================================

Hello Background: I am 26 y.o. currently working as a cardiac technologist, mainly in CVL. There's opportunity to learn echo in the future, but probably in a year or two. The hospital is also giving out sponsorships to take on Masters programme which i can apply for next year. However, recently, I was given the opportunity to join a paediatric hospital, mainly focusing on Echo. Interview is next Tuesday. I have only joined my current job in CVL for about 5 months and is not Echo trained While I feel that there's a lot to learn for Cath, which is rewarding; and enjoy the adrenaline rush, I really feel drained after every day's work and all I do is have dinner and sleep after work. I work over the weekends too. So i have no life of my own. And this would be worse after I start on calls. The children hospital does require us to do Cath once a week, and other non invasive procedures including Echo. But it's probably not as in-depth (we probs won't be needing to learn EP, implants or to use the machines like IVUS/OCT/FFR/etc. unlike in my current job). They also offer pathways like Management/Education/Research as i develop and advance in my career whereas my current job's only pathway is a senior clinical role. My boyfriend adviced for me to stay till i get sponsored for the masters programme, master CVL while serving the bond, then find another hospital to learn echo and progress myself with my higher qualification and experience in CVL. I am in contemplation if I should resign and go over to the paediatric hospital and would like to get some advice from this. Here's some of the considerations i'm thinking of: 1) Which earns better in the long run while providing a better work-life balance? 2) Which skillset is more valued by the industry in the future when AI takes over? 3) Which skillset would be able to open more doors for me in the future (e.g. if i were to be tired of clinical work and rather do (e.g) research/education/medical sales/management)? 4) is the masters degree really worth to stay for if i'm not into management? 5) any other inputs? thanks guys!!

Masters are largely worthless and can always be got later. Do echo if you have cath lab experience for the…experience. Are you getting on the job training for echo?
