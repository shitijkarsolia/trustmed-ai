Greetings all. As promised yesterday, here is my review of the CAPRICORN Trial. I wnet down a bit of a rabbit hole on this one, and I found it very interesting indeed ! Comments/questions are welcome ! I hope some people find it useful. If anyone wants to propose another paper for review, please do so, and if possible use [this thread to do so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiology/comments/1k263d5/statistical_and_methodological_reviews_of/). Otherwise I will choose something new on a topic that interests me (currently that is cardiotoxicity in patients receiving cancer therapies). These reviews will also be available [on my website](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews.html), along with a "Statistics Glossary for Cardiologists", which I hope will also be useful. Any suggestions or comments are very welcome. ------------- # Review and Statistical Critique of the CAPRICORN Trial (Lancet, 2001) # Background and Rationale The CAPRICORN trial evaluated the efficacy of carvedilol, a third-generation β-blocker, in patients who had experienced a myocardial infarction and exhibited significant left ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤40%). Previous β-blocker trials often excluded high-risk populations, leading to uncertainty about their applicability to contemporary clinical practice (Dargie &amp; CAPRICORN Steering Committee, 2000). # Original Study Design and Statistical Plan CAPRICORN was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,959 patients between 1997 and 1999. The initial primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with the study powered at 80% to detect significant differences at an α-level of 0.05 (Dargie &amp; CAPRICORN Steering Committee, 2000). A pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled after 125 deaths to assess early efficacy or futility — a common practice in clinical trials to determine whether a study should continue as planned, be modified, or be stopped early for ethical or scientific reasons. # Statistical Plan Amendment and Controversy Midway through the trial, the interim analysis revealed a lower-than-expected mortality rate, raising concerns about the study’s statistical power. Consequently, the primary endpoint was revised to include co-primary endpoints: all-cause mortality (α = 0.005) and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission (α = 0.045). This adjustment effectively split the original α-level between the two endpoints. Owen (2001) criticised this change, suggesting it introduced interpretive bias and compromised the trial’s validity, especially since the mortality result was emphasised despite not meeting the stricter significance threshold. # Authors’ Rebuttal and Remaining Concerns The original authors responded to Owen (2001) in the same editorial, emphasising the amendment's ethical and practical motivations. They argued that the change was made before unblinding, approved by the ethics committee, and aimed to maintain clinical relevance given the unexpectedly low mortality rate. They also stated that the α-split was transparently incorporated into the revised protocol. While these arguments have merit, concerns remain. The lack of formal α-spending approaches, such as O’Brien-Fleming boundaries, raises questions about statistical rigour. Furthermore, emphasising the mortality result — despite it not meeting the revised threshold — suggests a disconnect between formal statistical claims and narrative presentation. The rebuttal, though sincere, does not fully alleviate concerns about post-hoc adaptation and selective emphasis. # Understanding Mid-Trial Alpha-Level Changes In clinical trials, the pre-specified α-level should represent the maximum tolerable Type I error — the probability of incorrectly concluding treatment efficacy. Altering the α-level after interim data analysis is problematic, as it can inflate the risk of false-positive conclusions and undermine the integrity of the hypothesis test. Adaptive changes in trials facing operational challenges, like lower-than-expected event rates, can be acceptable if proper safeguards are employed. These include group sequential designs or α-spending functions, which mathematically preserve the overall Type I error rate. CAPRICORN did not utilise these methods. Although the revised thresholds were agreed upon before unblinding, the revision appears influenced by interim trends, introducing ambiguity about the independence of the statistical plan from emerging results. Such changes are uncommon in well-powered cardiovascular outcome trials and even rarer without formal statistical correction. CAPRICORN exemplifies how statistical flexibility can blur the line between clinical relevance and methodological rigour. # Ethical Dimensions of Protocol Amendments The CAPRICORN authors cited ethical reasons for the amendment, arguing that continuing to collect mortality data alone, when unlikely to yield definitive answers, would be inappropriate. They claimed the change preserved patient value and avoided unnecessary risk or prolongation. However, this ethical defence warrants scrutiny. If equipoise had been lost, continuing placebo administration might have been unethical; if equipoise remained, the trial’s planned endpoints should have persisted. This reveals an inconsistency. Moreover, it is unclear whether participants were informed of the amendment or if subsequent consent materials reflected the updated objectives. Transparency to participants is an ethical imperative. Beyond individual patient protection, trials have an ethical duty to the scientific community: to produce trustworthy, reproducible knowledge. By changing endpoints mid-trial and later highlighting a nominally significant result, CAPRICORN potentially undermined that trust — despite intentions. Ethical conduct encompasses beneficence, respect for persons, and scientific integrity. # Main Results and Statistical Interpretation For the composite endpoint, results showed no significant benefit (HR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80–1.07; p = 0.296). Mortality alone reached nominal significance (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60–0.98; p = 0.03), failing to meet the revised pre-specified threshold (α = 0.005). Secondary results included reductions in cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.75; p = 0.024) and non-fatal MI (HR = 0.59; p = 0.014) — both of which were statistically unadjusted and exploratory, warranting cautious interpretation. # Mechanistic Support from Substudies Despite methodological criticisms, strong biological substantiation emerged from two substudies. The Echo substudy demonstrated clear beneficial effects on LV remodelling, significantly reducing LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (Pfeffer et al., 2004). Furthermore, McMurray et al.’s (2005) arrhythmia substudy reported marked reductions in malignant ventricular arrhythmias (HR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.11–0.49; p &lt; 0.0001), strengthening the clinical justification for carvedilol use post-MI. # Contextualisation Within the Literature CAPRICORN’s outcomes align with earlier meta-analyses of β-blockers post-MI (eg., Freemantle et al., 1999), which demonstrated mortality benefit in broader populations. Importantly, CAPRICORN extended this evidence to higher-risk individuals with LV dysfunction. The American Heart Association’s 2001 guidelines referenced CAPRICORN as supporting evidence for carvedilol’s inclusion in post-MI regimens. Historical β-blocker trials such as BHAT and the Norwegian Timolol Study showed mortality reductions in less complex populations, and CAPRICORN importantly demonstrated additive benefit when combined with contemporary therapies such as ACE inhibitors. # Methodological Critique and Clinical Implications The statistical and ethical limitations associated with CAPRICORN’s mid-trial amendments are non-trivial. Clinicians must interpret the reported mortality benefit with appropriate caution. That said, the overall therapeutic narrative for carvedilol is supported by consistent mechanistic data and wider trial evidence. CAPRICORN thus contributes meaningfully to practice — albeit with caveats regarding methodological integrity. # Conclusions and Clinical Recommendations Carvedilol remains a rational choice for post-MI patients with LV dysfunction, underpinned by mechanistic plausibility and external evidence. However, CAPRICORN is a textbook example of why strict adherence to pre-specified statistical analysis plans is critical. Clinical researchers must balance ethics, practicality, and methodological discipline to safeguard credibility. # Glossary (Selected Terms) **Alpha-level** The pre-specified threshold for statistical significance. Commonly set at 0.05. **Type I error** The probability of falsely declaring treatment efficacy when none exists. **Alpha-spending function** Used in interim analyses to distribute the allowable α across multiple looks at the data. **Group sequential design** A design that allows for planned interim analyses with early stopping rules. **Hazard ratio** A measure of relative risk over time. HR &lt; 1 indicates reduced risk in the treatment group. **Full version with hyperlinks and references available at:** [https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews.html](https://thedataguru.net/stat-reviews.html) # Happy to take questions from cardiologists, statisticians, or others interested in methodology. # References CAPRICORN Investigators.

I might offer collaboration as I plan to make a serie of content aimed at french young card in training. I will dm you in time. The emphasis on the mortality result lacks good faith. The study was underpowered for the study of this outcome, as they found during their intermediate analysis. The whole discussion is dishonest in my opinion. Mechanistic considerations are useful 1) to generate hypothesis for further studies 2) to strengthen a positive result. I'm against them being used to turn a negative result into a semi positive one and then forgetting it was negative in the first place. Surrogate end point relationship with desired outcomes are sometimes surprising (CAST trial is a striking exemple) As for the use of BB in clinical practice today : - no good evidence for routine use for lvef &gt;50 (reduce-ami) - older studies before reperfusion era are not applicable - useful for heart failure with low lvef - no strong evidence for their routine use post MI when lvef is low, unless other indications are present. i use them in this setting anyway but very cautiously and wait until I feel the patient is not at risk. Clinical judgement is king.
10. u/liquidcrawler [score=1, created=2025-04-20T14:07:27]: Can you explain more about the following: &gt; The lack of formal α-spending approaches, such as O’Brien-Fleming boundaries, raises questions about statistical rigour The way I understand it is that during their interim analysis, they saw the event rate was very low and didn't want to keep going forever, so they came up with a new primary outcome and "split" the alpha level 0.05 --&gt; 0.005 and 0.045. The reason why this is statistically invalid (without proper correction) is that we just went from throwing 1 dice to throwing 2 dices (albeit, a 6 sided and like 20 sided), which increases the probability they get a "hit" or positive result. I guess to take it to an extreme, if they split it into 10 different new primary outcomes at 0.005, they're now throwing 10 different dice. Is this a correct understanding of why it is erroneous to do this?
