1. u/RealMurse [score=10, created=2025-04-21T22:20:27]: There’s a great App you can download called Journal Club (think an annual fee) but you can pull up pretty much all of the must reads in chronological order - for instance REDUCE-AMI, EMPEROR, PARAGON-HF, and ISCHEMIA (2020), etc are all in there. Though i prefer to read, in a pinch when met new things/considerations can augment with an AI app - OpenEvidence - which is far superior and accurately summarizes up to date evidence, lit reviews and pertinent RCT reviews/guideline updates. Just a measly NP here, but your role plays a crucial part in advanced HF, best wishes!
