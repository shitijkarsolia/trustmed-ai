Hey yall, I’m a MS1 interested in EP and I have been reading about and looking to shadow in the specialty a lot. I find the field fascinating and want to learn more about it. I was curious how important a background in physics/engineering is for EP based on the unique demands of the field vs how much can be learned on the job to be a great clinician and innovator in the field. I have been interested in physics but never studying more than the premed requirements in college. Would I benefit from some reading or studying in physics, especially EM physics relevant to EP? What can I do overall to prepare to be a great EP beyond the standard do well in all stages of training etc. I would really appreciate any advice about this or exploring interest in EP in general!

The reality is that to be a good EP, you should be a good cardiologist, and to be a good cardiologist, you need to be a good internist. So definitely learn the basics of action potentials / unique aspects of cardiac myocytes / heart failure and coronary physiology to the relevance of your USMLE exams and master them. It will pay off. -3rd year cardiology fellow starting EP fellowship this July
