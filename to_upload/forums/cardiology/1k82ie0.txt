===============================================================================

I’m a new cardiology resident and I am intending to buy a new stethoscope and was wondering which to buy and needed some help from the experts I’m considering Litmann core digital stethoscope and Eko core 500 I don’t know which to buy and would to have some help form you about your opinion They both have noice cancellation and amplification And they both detect murmurs as I assume But the eko 500 has ecg tracing and af detection available So what do you think which is better according to your experience? Thanks in advance ❤️

It’s a little finicky at first though and takes getting used to. I tried using a littman master cardiology for a week and I went crawling right back to the Core. Tip: if a patients breath sounds are so damn noisy when you’re trying to listen to the heart just have them hold their breath lol

5. u/No_Paramedic_2039 [score=3, created=2025-04-25T19:43:00]: Eric Topol who was an absolute giant in Cardiology in his day has gone on record saying the stethoscope is outdated and nothing more than a pair of “rubber tubes.” He’s naive enough to think that bedside hand held ultrasound is its logical replacement. Eric, who exactly is paying for this? What a dope.

I do a lot of nursing assessments daily and will probably remain active in nursing for another 5 years. I .like the ability of the eko 500 to improve the clarity of heart and lung sounds, but curious if this will work for basic cuff BP's? And, if so, will it work over clothing such as a long-sleeved t-shirt or light sweater? Secondly, I saw a video of a provider using it without the ear pieces and simply a paired iPod earpiece. Is this practical? I would mind having less bulk in my pocket. Thank you for any feedback. The cost of the Eko 500 has me curious about the use of basic stethoscope uses.
