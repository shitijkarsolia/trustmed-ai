Hi, everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. I just want to know what made you choose cardiology over cardiac surgery. I’m eager to pursue my career focusing on the heart but am unsure if I should pursue medicine or surgery with respect to this organ.

Others would focus on differences in lifestyle between two different specialties. As often happens in life, these decisions are also affected by external factors. I too was thinking about either cardiology or cardiovascular surgery in medical school. However, the cardio thoracic surgeons at my medical school were jerks, and whenever I arrived for or left my surgical rotation, their (admittedly amazing) cars were there in the parking lot. So I chose medicine. In my residency program, the cardiothoracic surgeons were cerebral and amazing. Had I done medical school where I did residency, my initial choice may have been different. As it turned out, the cardiologists were also charismatic, especially the heart failure cardiologists, and so I went down that path. And as I came to hospital before any medical student and left well after they departed during my attending years, I chuckled to myself as to how it all devolved. I worked very closely with the CT surgeons as medical director of the LVAD program, and they often commented on how my mindset was ‘surgical,’ while I was always impressed by their insistence on reviewing echocardiograms primarily and managing physiology in the cardiothoracic ICU. So in the end we really weren’t all that different, save for the lack of OR time for me ( though I would be called in to OR to offer my opinion on cases eg VAD positioning, and spent a lot of time in cath lab - my ‘OR’). Physiology was my first love, and hemodynamics continue to captivate me. For me, RHC &gt;&gt;&gt; LHC (unless there’s a STEMi). You may know that there is increasing hybridization of CT surgery and interventional cardiology training (eg TAVR, CT surgeons acquiring wire skills for catheter based interventions). Also consider that in terms of lifestyle, I’m not sure that the hours of CT surgeons and interventional cardiologists, at least, are that much different. Spend some time in the OR, spend some time in the cath lab/CCU, but, most importantly, spend time with physicians who love what they do. That’s where you’ll get both inspiration and the best idea of what a fulfilling career in either field looks like.

Different personalities, different difficulties. If you cannot live without being a surgeon, become a surgeon. There is room in procedural cardiology to scratch the itch without being a full blown surgeon. I am EP, it is very procedural, I would not want to be a CT surgeon.
3. u/Creepysarcasticgeek [score=8, created=2025-04-26T09:49:46]: What level are you? Are you in med school? Pre med? High school? The advice I usually give med students, before picking an organ you like, you have to identify the practice that you like. Do you like intensity vs non intense? High acuity vs outpatient practice? Procedural vs non procedural? Through a combination of your answers above you can identify the fields that will match your intended practice. Then you can look into specialties that can support that. If you don’t like acute patients or high intensity for example, cardiac surgery may not be for you, but community cardiology (and clinic) may still be an option. If you are not yet in med school I’d say it’s too early to decide.
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=7, created=2025-04-26T16:31:20]: I actually think they are very different fields. Perhaps the biggest thing to keep in mind is that cardiology is usually a very diverse field (cath lab, office visits, hospital consultation, imaging, etc.) while the CT surgery career really just revolves around surgeries. In my opinion this makes cardiology a much more flexible choice. Lifestyle can be similar, but keep in mind that there are typically more ICs, let alone general cardiologists than CT surgeons, so call burden is generally less. Cardiologists also can have long-term relationships with patients and all the benefits that brings. Both fields do meaningful work and still have potential to make a decent income.
5. u/Gideon511 [score=3, created=2025-04-26T11:51:16]: The more procedural or surgical you are, the more the difference in outcome is determined by your personal skill, as a CT surgeon there will be deaths, re-operations due to your own lack of ability, rather than due to a process not working right per se. it is heavy weight to carry, not everyone can do it. You will ruminate on your failures etc. for the right mindset and skill set it is good work, but it is in my opinion very difficult dangerous work. There are easier paths for the money, which also help people. It is doing some of the most dangerous difficult work in medicine. Younger people are more willing to assume the lifestyle, the older you get the more it weighs on you. I would really do an inventory on what kind of person you are and what kind of life you want and what you are prepared to sacrifice in order to pursue a particular kind of work.

I like my boring, low impact(physically), relatively low stress 8-5 job that lets me focus on the heart all day.
7. u/BiharkLala [score=3, created=2025-04-27T04:40:24]: The question comes again and again, for me the sealing deal is that as a Cardiologist buck stops at you! The patient comes to you and you are the incharge of his heart and you REFER the patient to the surgeon then he gets to operate on him plus the imaging knowledge echo etc is also very poor amongst the surgeons.
8. u/[deleted] [score=6, created=2025-04-26T16:46:25]: You're an IMG. CT Surgery will be next to impossible. You have virtually zero chance at the integrated programs. Your only chance would be gen surgery to CT surgery fellowship which again is competitive and as an IMG you have very slim chance. At least cardiology there's more spots and IMGs match every year, though it has been getting more and more competitive every year. However, you have a realistic chance of matching IM and Cardiology. And this is all the things you should be thinking about prior to the the pathway of Medicine vs Surgery. Since CT surgery and Cardiology are two wildly different fields of the medical field. But in short, you have little to no chance of matching CT surgery as an IMG.
