===============================================================================

I’ve had my heart set on becoming an EP Tech for a while now. I’ve been working on my prerequisites and was planning to apply for an associate’s program at Sentara College of Health Sciences in Virginia. However, last week Sentara lost their accreditation, and now I’m at a loss about what to do next. If I can’t figure out a more direct pathway, I’ll probably end up going the Cath Lab route and cross-training, but I’m not nearly as excited about that. Does anyone here have any opinions or ideas? Edit: also there are no cvt invasive programs in va. At least that I can find.

Once I graduated and got a job as a stress test technician where I really learned to understand EKGs. I then got a job working in a device clinic where I interrogated/troubleshooted pacemakers and ICDs. This widened and deepened my knowledge of cardiology and electrophysiology. After working in the clinic for 2 years… I got hired as an EP tech in a pretty big academic center EP Lab. Once again, my knowledge and understanding has tremendously grown. Other techs in my lab used to be paramedics, rad techs, ED techs, anesthesia techs, cath lab techs. There’s prob a few others I just can’t think of atm. Needless to say, there’s lots of pathways into the lab. Feel free to message me if you have any more questions.

Which would be their EP certificate program, if you already have a degree that’s a good route. Many cath labs have EP labs, worth asking the program director about their clinical sites and if you get the opportunity to be in EP while in the cath lab program. Don’t they have an accredited AS CVT program? I’m not sure which program you’re saying lost accreditation… do you have a link to that? The Certificate EP program?
