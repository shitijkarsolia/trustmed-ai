===============================================================================

Was wondering what the cardiologist here think is most important for them when considering lifestyle and overall satisfaction with their career and balance overall. How does call time/intensity, length of days, intensity of days, patient population, etc weigh in your calculations? What about the sense of accomplishment from procedures/other successes? I know many are personal but was wondering if there are overall trends or commonly missed but important considerations for a medical student interested in the field but also not willing to have medicine be my whole life.

I also think that, overall, a position that allows you to have more time away from work is generally beneficial (which many of these things play into). However, don't ignore the other aspects of job satisfaction. As much as we talk about (and appreciate) time off, we all have invested a lot in our careers and we want to see accomplishments there too (not to just have relatively 'easy' or 'higher paying' jobs). Other things that play in: \- Appreciation by employer, including fair pay \- Good colleagues and support \- Opportunities to do 'extra' (nonclinical) things: teaching, research, admin, etc. \- Leadership opportunities \- Etc.

Support, colleagues, coworkers, patients, fair pay, control/independence, etc. The sense of accomplishment doesn't matter much to me outside of feeling like I did a good job.
3. u/doctordavemd [score=2, created=2025-04-27T10:27:59]: Intensity and frequency both important. If you're the only doc in a rural town, you might almost never get called, but you're effectively on 24/7. In an urban practice, you might be q15, but asked to cover stemi at hospitals across town, that desire being close are actually a 30 minute drive. Then there is the support you get from colleagues, admin, nursing, etc., all of which is highly variable and difficult to quantify when interviewing.
