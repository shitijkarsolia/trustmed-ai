===============================================================================

Hey everyone, I’m starting my cardiology fellowship in July and have been thinking a lot about what kind of career I want to build. I’m still deciding between doing a super fellowship or maybe going non-invasive with a specific focus and one thing that has fascinated me and I have been drawn to is AI with it's potential in our lifetime, especially in cardiology, where I see so much potential. Since I don't have mentors who carved career in this niche, wanted to know if there is anyone here already working in this space or even generally even in the cardiology+informatics? What does your day-to-day look like? How did you get into it? Also, how does compensation compare to more traditional clinical work? Would love to hear any thoughts, advice, or just what your experience has been like if you’ve gone down that path!
