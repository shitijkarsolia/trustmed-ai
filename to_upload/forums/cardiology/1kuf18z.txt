===============================================================================

Hello everyone! New to this community and seeking advice from the experts who know the space best. I have an offer at a reputable company as a sales rep for their lead extraction devices. I come from the world of disposables in the IR/Cath lab space and so don't have a large exposure to this procedure. I am curious about the nature of these lead extractions as case coverage will be a large part of the role. This would be covering the mechanical sheaths used to extract the leads, locking stylets and snares. It also has some product for lead placement like catheters, working sheaths and even a transceptal needle for the EP side. Note: I would not be representing the actual pacemakers, ICDs or ablation catheters. Most important questions: 1. Is this as dangerous, intense and long a procedure as some of the Reddit threads from patients make it out to be? 6-12 hour cases with potential for very negative outcomes? 2. As a rep what will my role in the room most likely be for the physician and staff? If anyone scrubs these currently and has worked with a rep please let me know how they were involved. I want to know the honest truth about what I am getting into. 3. Are these cases emergent? And if they are how much lead time is usually given? Trying to get a feel for this before I move forward and there is only so much current reps at the company can and will divulge prior to accepting. Thank you for your insights and time!

It is very high stress and most drs don’t love them coupled with poor reimbursement to risk ratio. You will be guaranteed to see a higher fatality rate compared to even in the cath lab. That said it is rewarding because someone has to do these. 2. You will be involved in the case possibly making recommendations or opening equipment. You will train drs and staff. As a rep you will not be allowed to scrub in or touch patients. 3. Not emergent but urgent if infection. It is often a scheduled procedure because it needs an OR lot time and team. No 3am times but may add on next day type thing you would have travel to.
2. u/La_raquelle [score=7, created=2025-05-24T09:41:18]: 1. There is published data about the safety of extractions—take a look at various articles online. Most providers overestimate the risk of mortality/serious morbidity. Older leads = higher risk. Most of our cases take around 4 hours. Sometimes 6-7, but that is for more complex/very aged leads, usually with need to place a new CS lead following extraction or some other more niche procedure (SVC stent). 2. Our reps advise on prepping and how to best utilize the tools they rep for. Reps are scrubbed in, but they come in and out of the case, hang out and socialize in the control room when not needed. 3. No, these are not emergent cases. Can be urgent-ish, but the nuances of an extraction program can make it difficult to expedite cases. Some centers are better at expediting than others. If infection is the reason to extract, you want the leads out within 2 weeks.
3. u/haripj99 [score=8, created=2025-05-24T09:56:29]: As an extractor I can answer your questions: 1. Definitely a risky procedure although the chance of the serious risks is still quite low. However if there is a cardiac perforation during something like an ablation often you would get away with just a pericardiocentesis and the patient will do well. If there is a SVC tear it requires emergency surgery and still the patient may not do well depending on their comorbidities. 2. Your role as a rep will depend on the program. In my extraction cases the rep is never there as our team is well versed with the products available and prep, proper workflows etc. The laser generator is quite easy to use. Testing of the equipment is done by a laser safety officer that is employed by the hospital. In a place where there is a lower volume, high staff turnover, or is a newer program you might be needed to cover cases to recommend the right tool or even for moral support to the physician 😁 3. Almost never emergent, but can be urgent if the patient is septic from bacteremia related to a device infection. Most of those infected leads extract very easily though and in my experience I have rarely needed to struggle or even use extraction tools.
4. u/slimelord222 [score=6, created=2025-05-24T10:34:19]: Lead extraction is the most poorly reimbursed procedure relative to risk/effort in medicine. Nothing like taking out 20 year old pacer leads for 6 hours for 8 rvu. The poor reimbursement, extreme backup requirements (OR, perfusion) and risk are huge headwinds to growth and are out of your control as a rep. Good luck
