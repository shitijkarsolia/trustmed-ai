Any academic EP attendings of fellows willing to share their schedules and prospectives on the field for an interested med student? I have baseline strong interest in the field and want to pursue academics but want to know about the day to day and week to week how you feel about what you do. You know, what really matters to you decades out of training when you’ve done these procedures countless times and got family etc. I want to make sure I am considering the right things when comparing different specialities although it’s tempting to just say ya I love this right now I’m going to do it! Really appreciate any advice!

3. u/Wannabeachd [score=10, created=2025-05-24T16:53:59]: I know one, EP call 24h 7 days (very light, fellow takes call), 2 days off 5 days of CCU 24h (generally only need to be present for rounds, leave at 2:30-3 fellows do admits and tons of indepents, micu attending does all procedures/codes);and then 3 clinic days (7-8h 30m slots) 525k. Don't think there's any pub goals but puts out 1-2 case reports/manuscripts per year

The pay is MUCH better in private practice or a mixed model, and there are still many opportunities to engage in industry sponsored research and meaningfully contribute to the field. At conferences, there is little difference between academic and private EP until you start to look at mechanistic/translational research. Harder to study an animal model in private practice, etc. Academic EP is wonderful, and I love it dearly. That said, I recognize it's limitations and some days I feel a bit stifled. Academic EP is useful for the following two priorities: frequent teaching of residents/fellows and translational/clinical research that a company would be less likely to fund but the government might. To answer your question, my week varies: I do procedures 2-3 days per week, clinic 1 day per week, and research 1-2 days per week. The breakdown changes week to week. Your ability to protect your research time in academics is directly related to your research funding. Your funding supports part of your salary, 'buying down' your clinical RVU requirements. Some of us do more, some of us do less. Some of us are all clinical (3 days in the lab, 1-2 days clinic/1 day admin). I see many academic EPs start to specialize: They either focus on very complex arduous procedures or the exact opposite. Some things that are easier to do in an academic environment are the time intensive, arduous, less reimbursed procedures. I get to do a lot of endo/epi VT ablation, for example. The risk/reward and time commitment often isn't worth it in the private practice setting. Anyway, EP is awesome. You should keep exploring it!

7. u/ConnerVetro [score=-5, created=2025-05-24T16:49:15]: I don’t think it exists in any meaningful capacity.
