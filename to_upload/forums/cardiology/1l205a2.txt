===============================================================================

Hi there everyone, How are you folks feeling for the boards this year (for future reference, the test is scheduled to happen on July 15, 2025). I have used the livestreamed Mayo echo board review course (was planning on attending in person but missed my flight there). I am also studying from the ASE echo board review. I did BoardVitals completely and I feel doing those questions prepared me for the ASE qbank (the "practice exams"). Anyone here has any clue what a good % is in the ASE Qbank to pass this board exam? I'm almost done with Exam 1 and for now my score is about 61% I really need to pass this test since I need it for my job so the stakes are high. Hope to hear for your comments/advice.

The explanations are great and the questions are generally slightly harder than the boards themselves which I felt prepared me well. Good luck!!

3. u/Docdad30 [score=5, created=2025-06-02T20:11:26]: I’m also planning to take it this year. So far I have done Klein’s once and mayo videos. Now I’m doing Klein and ASE videos again. Attempted ASE qbank before registering for exam a month ago and I scored 55%. Hoping I can score 70% midway in this month. I think that should get me through. Fingers crossed.
4. u/JibsDibs [score=3, created=2025-07-15T13:19:31]: It was brutal. How many do we need to correct to pass?
5. u/Human_Operation_1014 [score=3, created=2025-09-11T03:49:49]: scores are out
6. u/Purple_Ad_6867 [score=2, created=2025-07-05T11:08:24]: has anyone recently taken the ase simulation 1 exam? i did not do very well. wondering whats the pass rate needed here, i got 60%.
7. u/VividRevolution1166 [score=2, created=2025-07-15T17:56:42]: I thought the test was fair, harder than the ASE practice test, easier than Klein. Honestly, was expecting a more difficult test. Some tricky questions. There were a couple of calculation questions that were time consuming. A few surprising questions asking to grade degreemhypokinesis/systolic function by eye, which I thought was subjective.

9. u/Purple_Ad_6867 [score=2, created=2025-09-11T07:26:01]: Results now available on website
10. u/Purple_Ad_6867 [score=2, created=2025-09-11T07:26:33]: Guys echo results are now available on the website.
11. u/CarelessInvestment8 [score=1, created=2025-07-02T21:50:08]: Thoughts on skipping low yield topics like synchrony?
12. u/Human_Operation_1014 [score=1, created=2025-07-03T03:26:27]: which prosthetic valve guidelines do you think will be tested? the updated one from 2024?
13. u/Popular_Jeweler [score=1, created=2025-07-15T17:46:29]: Same feeling. The physics questions being fully conceptual was unexpected. But I did feel that I did well. LOVED the new calculator, fully scientific so you can see what you are doing and easily square and multiply times pi
14. u/Competitive_Leek_907 [score=1, created=2025-08-13T19:12:13]: Did you pass? I NEED to as well with my job on the line too🙏🏻😏
