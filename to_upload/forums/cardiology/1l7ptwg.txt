===============================================================================

Hello! I’ve made a post on here before, but I need some more advice. I’ve decided I want to take the CCT (certified cardiology tech) exam. I have only been an EKG tech since December, so my knowledge is limited. I took a short free practice test online, and learned that I know nothing about nuclear stress tests or anything like that. I currently read 24/48 hour holter monitors and perform treadmill stress test (with the cardiologist present). Does anyone know of any programs in SoCal that would help me be better equipped for this exam? Everything I find online is either for a Cardiovascular Tech, or is out of state/country. I bought a study guide on Amazon, but I’m afraid that won’t be enough. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
