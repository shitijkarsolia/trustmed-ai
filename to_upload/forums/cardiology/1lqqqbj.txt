===============================================================================

Im entering my 3rd year of fellowship and despite doing over 200 TEEs, I feel like I am complete trash at them. I want to do imaging and I enjoy TEEs. Any tips on getting better beside just practicing? I alot of the senior attending at my institution grab the probe with the wheel facing them so they can use their index/middle for the seek angle, but I just can't get a comfortable position that way. Especially when imaging left sided structures my wrist ends up being in a very uncomfortable extended position. I try keeping the probe taut. Help?!

I’ll share my experience of what helped initially during my fellowship and trust me it gets much better with time. For the outpatient cases, positioning them in left lateral position with their right knee flexed and their right shoulder tilted towards me with a pillow propping their back really helps get relatively uniform positions where my wrist movement, ante and retroflexion give me what I expect. I remember the LA appendage and pulmonary veins being particularly difficult in the beginning. The structural cath cases - ASD/PFO, clips and earlier TAVR cases taught me how to adjust to the supine position; maneuver quickly &amp; efficiently between different views. Biplane and live 3D help a lot. Also, worked on my 3D/4D zooms during these. The cardiac surgery cases were a great opportunity to get better, especially at the transgastric views for AV and TV.

Went in, use very slight movements, micro movements, to get the best image quality. Don’t be afraid to go off axis / off the traditional view to see what you need. Always do everything in the same order (unless an emergency situation such as bronchospasm requires you to pull the probe and you just need one thing such as the appendage).

I use my left hand mostly to stabilize the prove and provide a bit of tension, but I allow it to spin in my hand when clock/countering. I use whatever right finger is available to change the seek angle and retro/anteflex. I typically don't use the small wheel. Interested in anybody does anything similar.

6. u/Excellent-Tea2125 [score=1, created=2025-07-03T09:57:39]: I’m only a 2nd year and have done less than you but I like keeping it by my side and using my index and thumb to move the wheel. I think keeping it low also helps with maintaining tension on the probe. Curious to see what other people think though since we do most our TEEs with IC people lol
