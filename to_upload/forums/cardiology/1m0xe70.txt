Hi all Newly minted 3rd year fellow with a focus on non-invasive cardiology (Hope to get echo, nuc and CT certified) Will be starting my job search process soon but I don’t even know where to start What are some tips or tricks you recommend when looking for jobs and finding the perfect fit. My fear is that I don’t want to end up at a place where I am not growing as a physician or where there is no mentorship.. also I do not want to end up in a toxic place. Any advice? What tools or resources did you use for job search?

Generally, jobs fit 2 of the 3 criteria: good lifestyle, good salary, good location (which 2 are your most important factors)? Best to start the job search early: use reputable websites and job boards like NEJM, ACC. If you are looking at a specific area, you can find jobs by cold emailing or cold calling local practices with a CV prepared to fax or email them. Even if you start the job search early, don't worry if you don't get an interview or job offer until much later in the academic year. There is still time to find jobs even until July/August of next year. Being in general cardiology helps a lot too since job market is very good. Finally, don't sell yourself short in terms of negotiating your salary, bonuses, etc in your contract. There are good websites like Physician Side Gigs, MedAxiom, MGMA (need to pay or subscribe) so you know what to expect in your region and specialty. Also definitely get a contract lawyer, you don't want to miss out on terms before you officially sign.

I cold called hospitals or used any and every connection I had that might help me. Family, friends, med school, residency, fellowship, reps, etc. I started early, cast a wide net and talked to a lot of people, not necessarily with the goal of getting a job but just to get the lay of the land. I was able to land a good job. The likelihood of landing a perfect first job is slim to none. But you can certainly land a good job. Sometimes it's just luck or timing. And don't forget many people leave their first job within the first few years. You might change as well. I'm not sure what you mean by growing as a physician or mentorship. But if the latter is important make sure it's part of your job search. Turnover can be a good indicator of how things are. Observe if people are happy and are folks you want to work with, not just doctors but staff too. Then looking into things like admin support if hospital employed, culture, staff support, call intensity (not just frequency) and so on. It's not just about the money.
3. u/aethes [score=4, created=2025-07-15T16:57:11]: Hey hey. My process was sorta simple. I knew the geographic area I wanted to be in. So I went on that states EMS website, which typically includes a list of all hospitals in the state (so local EMS can find hospitals) and then started emailing those hospitals. Most places have a physician recruiter and I’d email them and start the conversation. Eventually leads to a conversation with a cards person so you can get a sense of if it’s what you’re looking for.

5. u/KtoTheShow [score=2, created=2025-07-15T19:22:14]: Reach out through your network and prior fellows to find which groups are hiring (or thinking about adding). You'll most likely find 2 of 3 (salary, location, job description) Don't join a tiny group if you want to avoid the lack of growth Toxic places tend to have high turnover Try to secure at least 2 positions so you can negotiate a bit once you are viewed as desireable
