===============================================================================

Hello all! I’m an IM resident planning on applying to cardiology over the next few cycles. I just wanted to gauge the reputation/training of the Chicago community programs compared to some of the mid-tier academics (rush, Loyola, UIC, etc). I’m not really interested in research or advanced fellowships. Mostly want to know how the programs compare in terms of clinical training, OP exposure, procedures, critical care training, transplant, echo training, and overall preparing me for a career in community cardiology. Thanks!

1. u/PewPewMD [score=6, created=2025-07-19T07:12:22]: In cardiology training, regardless of your goal practice setting, you want to go to a program that has a variety of sub specialty exposure, as well has high volume and good case mix. Specifically you asked about critical care, transplant, echo training. Short answer: no, community programs are not the same as academics. The community programs operate like a private practice, so you’ll have very little access to transplant (I believe Christ is the only “transplant” hospital, and even then, they’re more of a VAD mill). Similarly, ICU is disjointed in most community hospitals, whereas in most academic programs it operates more like a closed unit. And the best cardiology critical care exposure will come at transplant centers, because those are the places that get the shock patients for transplant evaluation. Even if you want to be a community doc with only outpatients, a more rigorous and varied training program will make you a better doctor. If you’re asking whether the community cares programs are just as good as the academic ones, they’re not. For the reasons mentioned above. That said, if you have a choice between. Community cards fellowship or none at all, well, the choice is obvious.
