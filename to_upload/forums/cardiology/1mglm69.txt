Hi, Hospitalist here from my other post Now, I have free time and money, before the fellowship application I want to build a really strong foundation. Before jumping into observerships/researchs etc, I want to rebuild my core knowledge and instate on top of it. That includes things like starting from pathophys, all the way to EP. Do you have any book that is efficient and helped you? I will build knowledge for 6 months or so, then work intensively on research+connections+observerships etc. I targeted: * *Pathophysiology of Heart Disease* by Lilly * *Rapid Interpretation of EKGs* by Dubin * *ECG Workout* by Jane Huff * *The Only EKG Book You’ll Ever Need* by Thaler * [EKGWaves.com](https://www.ekgwaves.com/) – daily rhythm review and quizzes * *Electrophysiology: The Basics* by Jonathan Steinberg *The other post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiology/comments/1mglhsc/hospitalist\_planning\_to\_become\_an\_ep\_down\_the/)*

2. u/astrofuzzics [score=4, created=2025-08-03T16:14:37]: Maybe I am biased, but I think it’s very important to understand the language of echocardiography - there is so much about cardiology that you just don’t get if you don’t get echo. There are two major echo textbooks, one by Jay Oh and the other by Catherine Otto. You don’t have to read them now, but right before you start cardiology fellowship they are great. I like the Oh book better. At least, when the time comes, read the chapter about “Color and Doppler,” and you will be much better prepared to learn echo.

4. u/pillaylay [score=3, created=2025-08-03T09:41:33]: Practical Cardiovascular Medicine by Elias Hanna is a quick read. Surface level but can serve as a good foundation.

Note that it is a bit old, but will give you broad strokes on the pathophys, you just need to be mindful that some of the guidelines have been changed slightly. Second O'Keefe and the 12 lead ECG:art of interpretation is a great resource.

I know you are asking for a book, but let me give you an additional recommendation In my opinion, the best foundation for cardiology fellowship (and practice) is the [Mayo Clinic Board Review Course](https://cveducation.mayo.edu/store/cardiovascular-board-review-for-initial-certification-and-recertification). This can be in-person, virtual or recorded. I was able to go in person (on scholarship) my first year of fellowship and it did more for me than any book has. Many fellows (and recent fellows) may have copies of the lecture videos. Their full selection of board review series are [here](https://cveducation.mayo.edu/store/board_reviews/search?reset_search=true&amp;mc_id=google&amp;campaign=1651501434&amp;geo=9057137&amp;kw=mayo%20clinic%20cardiology%20board%20review&amp;ad=438812264555&amp;network=g&amp;sitetarget=&amp;adgroup=99154576942&amp;extension=&amp;target=kwd-301605196059&amp;matchtype=b&amp;device=c&amp;account=6969876285&amp;placementsite=minnesota&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1651501434&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8Qu29qhBDKL7qWF-lHxdIEg18JP&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkbzEBhAVEiwA4V-yqqMBEnOloKcOO6ZhehMfc7MCa8C48FhDIqoDfvUVPci-42giun9LFBoC0VUQAvD_BwE). I can recommend the general and echo series.
7. u/pvarp [score=2, created=2025-08-03T11:55:03]: Fogoros' Electrophysiologic Testing is a classic intro to EP text. It's a great "pocketable" resource that's easy to digest before wading into more indepth 1000 page texts like Josephson's. I also find Heart Rhythm/EHRA/APHRS et al consensus statements to be a great resource as they summarize all the clinical evidence on a particular topic (i.e. Management of A Fib or ventricular arrhythmias) up to the point of publication
8. u/nalsnals [score=2, created=2025-08-03T13:44:22]: Katz physiology of the heart is great https://www.amazon.com.au/Physiology-Heart-Arnold-M-Katz/dp/1608311716
9. u/Fabulous-Ad5980 [score=2, created=2025-08-06T18:27:51]: My recommendation is to reevaluate your approach. Studying can always be done in free time when work on research, connections, observerships, etc. is in a slow period. On the other hand, those other things take a lot of time. You usually don’t have to dedicate much time to them per day, but you need to be working on them for months to get anywhere. So start with the big difficult things, and do your reading when there is spare time. Then, just read the guidelines from all the professional society (SCCT, ACC, HRS, etc). Hope that helps.
