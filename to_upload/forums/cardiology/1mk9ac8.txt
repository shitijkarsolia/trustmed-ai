===============================================================================

Hey, I am a IM resident (26 yo F) second year of residency. Thinking of applying for cardio next year. My program is a community program without a cath lab and we don’t see STEMI patients or manage very complex cardiac for post PCI patients here. I have arranged away elective to the hospital that has cath lab and advanced cardiac ICU for me to have some exposure. I will have 3-4 research projects published hopefully by next year and i am aiming for mainly community program. Not very competitive programs as it would be impossible with my limited cardiac exposure. We have 4 cardiologist here in the hospital who are very great people and will provide me with good LORs. I will also apply very broadly as I dont want to restrict myself to location or anything. We all know it is very competitive but How doable you guys think it is for me as a young female, very passionate about cardio, not restricted to location or area, with strong 4 LORs to match into cardiology. Is it even doable or should i just wait and build more connections and stronger CV and apply after a year or two? Also I have a green card. no visa issues. Thanks

That said, your credentials will still play a major role in fellowship. If you are a USMD or have excellent Step scores, that can compensate to some degree for your residency.

I did IM at a community program that no one ever heard of, but ended up matching to cardiology without a gap/research/whatever year. Only one person had ever applied to cardiology from my program before me, and they unfortunately didn't match. The key (in my opinion) is having very solid LORs, preferably from writers or mentors with good connections and serving as chief, ideally as a PGY3. You'll be at a disadvantage but it can be done. I have co-fellows that matched from community IM programs as well. Many trainees are obsessed with academic powerhouse institutions and such for cardiology, but to be honest my community program trains very solid cardiologists. And we get a lot of procedural exposure and insight into the world of community cardiology. Which is quite different from academic cardiology in a lot of (good) ways.

They might be able to email people at the institutions they trained at to try to open some doors for you. Are your research projects first author? That’s the real box you need to check.
7. u/allykinz130 [score=1, created=2025-08-08T04:52:03]: Do you have the option to do an external rotation for cards elective? Like traveling to a hospital for a week or two that has a cath lab just to have that experience?
8. u/bekks95 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T19:23:03]: I also matched from community program to a large university program. Don’t overthink it, just do as mush as possible that you can, work hard and it will pays off. There are always ways to find a fellowship spot. Consider non-accredited year (HF, vascular) if god forbid you don’t match. A lot of big university centers have those spots open always. Best of luck and feel free to text if any other questions!
