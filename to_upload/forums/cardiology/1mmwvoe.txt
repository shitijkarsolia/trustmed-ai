===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I recently started my cardiology fellowship. I’ve began to regret my choice greatly. I had an opportunity to match GI but picked cardiology instead (was interested in both). After seeing offers online for outpatient GI with ASC ownership + no call and $1 million+ salaries, I feel that I’ve made the wrong choice. Cardiology appears to be more work for less pay. Additionally my colleague who matched GI appears to have a much better schedule compared to me. I guess I’m posting to vent and see if anyone has felt like this before. I feel like I may have been able to achieve better entrepreneurship and financial independence with GI instead of cardiology. Edit: Thanks for everyone’s input! Really opened my eyes!

Sure GI could make as much, but you have to "do GI". No offence but I can't imagine dealing with colonoscopies day in and out. I love my STEMIS, chest pains and CHF patients. Beauty of cards is that you can cut down on procedures and focus more work on imaging and clinic and still make as much without stress of procedures.

3. u/piros_pimiento [score=40, created=2025-08-10T16:15:21]: New GI fellow who was a tentative cards applicant in the beginning of residency. I ask myself the same thing, if I should’ve done cardiology every time I get a call in the middle of the night about a patients bowel prep or I get a consult about fulminant functional gastroparesis. I doubt attendings making big bucks don’t take call… but you can bet your tushy I’ll take a pay cut to not do that. Grass is greener. Enjoy having clear cut useful guidelines.
4. u/cardiofellow10 [score=62, created=2025-08-10T16:30:37]: Replying as a IC who just started year 2 of practice. Regrets right now arent going to help you like cardiology. Why go into a tough fellowship if you arent passionate about it? People who do ns, ortho, IC, GS, etc have a passion in their field, money is prob the 2nd or 3rd factor. If its your first factor going into cards then you need reevaluate your standing in cards and medicine in general. You will make plenty of $$ in medicine irrespective of your field. The worst thing you can do for yourself is to finish something which you dont like bc thats a road for misery lifelong not only for you but more importantly for your patients. Yes GI makes more some places…so what.? NS makes more. Admins make more sitting twiddling their thumbs and telling us what to do.. You are in first year and shouldn’t be worried about $$ right now and looking at what others make. Cardiology is one of the most demanding jobs out there bc our patients are sick and require immediate attention in most cases when every other specialty has run out of ideas. Give it time and you’ll either realize that you start to love cards or you are miserable. If its the latter then dont finish and find an alternative path bc thats neither good for your health nor the patients. From personal experience, i can tell you, I make just as much or more than my GI colleagues but thats doesn’t matter. What matters is the amount of people i have been able to help whether its by stemis, making their heart recover from 10% to 60% heart, etc. i dont think that satisfaction would ever be matched by anything else i would have done or made millions in business or wall street. Doing medicine is a privilege and you absolutely deserve to make good money at it. A difference of 300k or 400k/year over lifetime wont make a difference in your life. I hope you seriously have some self reflection about this. Cardiology is a great field!

GI doesn’t have significantly better money or lifestyle than cardiology in any real sense. At this point the practice setting will have drastically bigger implications on those things than the specialty will
6. u/Warm-Lingonberry-523 [score=63, created=2025-08-10T16:14:42]: Yes you made the wrong choice. Now leave cardiology so someone that desires cardiology for real can have your spot.
7. u/doc2025 [score=14, created=2025-08-10T17:30:37]: Always remember the higher the salary the more is expected of you and the more you will have to produce to justify that salary. No one is sitting there handing out $1 million dollars just because you got into a competitive GI fellowship (or cards for that matter). If theyre paying you that much you're expected to bring a ton of value in return for the practice/hospital system and be a top producer/revenue generator (which by the way can put you into government scrutiny). Those GI doctors making a million a year are likely a factory line of colonoscopies without much break during those days plus seeing a ton of patients in the office. Theyre hustling to make that money. There may be exceptions but exceptions dont disprove the rule. Having said all that, cardiology often ranks among top 3-5 highest paying specialties among all fields. Cardiac procedures are being moved into outpatient settings also including cardiac ACS/office based labs in many states so this is literally just the beginning for cardiology. No one understands the heart and everyone is afraid of it so demand and job security will always be there. And if you want to prioritize lifestyle you can find a large general cardiology practice to join--they have a great lifestyle.
8. u/MGS-1992 [score=9, created=2025-08-11T04:13:18]: Heart &gt; Butthole. So no, you made the right choice.
9. u/nalsnals [score=6, created=2025-08-10T19:21:12]: Do you actually enjoy cardiology? It is hard work and people whose primary motivation is lifestyle and revenue rarely do justice to their patients.
10. u/astrofuzzics [score=6, created=2025-08-10T16:16:37]: There are private cardiologists making that kind of money. They own their own clinics and imaging suites (echo, CT, even nuclear with a D-SPECT camera). It’s often a group practice setup, with each group having its own terms of employment and partnership track, but it’s out there. See if you can get some CT training as a general fellow - Cardiac CT boards are pretty straightforward, and then you can read calcium scores and coronary CTAs which are very common and sometimes useful tests. You are right, GI probably does offer a bit of an easier track towards that kind of career with endoscopy suites. But cardiology still has options.
11. u/oatmilkcortado_ [score=7, created=2025-08-10T21:26:20]: Cards is better. More versatility and the hospital wants to suck you off. GI is literally dealing with other people’s shit.
12. u/Ornery_Jell0 [score=4, created=2025-08-10T17:17:05]: Quit
13. u/ManufacturerLow1263 [score=5, created=2025-08-12T05:24:24]: Yes you made a mistake. Cards of 25 years here . Cards is for people who love cardiology. Money is secondary. Do yourself a favor and find the essay you wrote to get into medical school and see if this Reddit question makes any sense now.
14. u/Greenheartdoc29 [score=4, created=2025-08-10T21:34:44]: It sure sounds like you made the wrong choice and you’re motivated by the wrong reasons. You need to look in the mirror.
15. u/cardsguy2018 [score=4, created=2025-08-11T09:47:00]: Yeah and I can point to $1M cardiology jobs or fellowships where GI is worked like dogs. $1M in any specialty is hard work period. The landscape for any specialty can change anytime. Do whatever interests you and move on with life. Stop comparing yourself or else you'll never be happy in life.
16. u/supadupasid [score=3, created=2025-08-10T20:41:16]: isn't that anecdotal? Look for a similar job in cards in a similar location. On average these specialties will payout the same. 1 million isn't obvious there average GI job, so compare their 90% to cards' 90%. Cardiology has a better lifestyle than GI. You messed up on that front bro. But, high acuity is part of why people have an interest in cardiology.
17. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-08-10T23:59:55]: Realistically: the pay is comparable. On average, they are similar (or cardiology makes very slightly more). You can find unusual opportunities in either field where a random job pays extremely well or the schedule is very lax. Also, keep in mind that pay can change quickly. CMS changes reimbursement all the time (just ask your friendly neighborhood EP). We are also always just one hot-and-bothered congressman away from changes that can drastically change things like ASC regulations. Between these two fields, the pay isn't that different. If you are not an interventinalist, the schedule is not that much different either. If these are the things that are causing you to second-guess your decision then it it is very possible that you made the wrong choice.
18. u/pantless_doctor [score=3, created=2025-08-11T03:32:59]: The difference in pay is small enough not to worry about. $1mil isn't uncommon for high rvu cardiology. And I suspect most gi jobs aren't $1 mil... I've never even consider gi so I'm biased but cardiology is much more versatile (less boring) and less dependant on elective outpatient procedures with risk of being paid less or economic downturn and people putting them off.
19. u/Conscious_Garlic3874 [score=3, created=2025-08-11T09:42:50]: I'm doing non-invasive cards. Signed a contract for a hospital based practice 30-40 min outside a relatively large city in the midwest and I'll make 550k guaranteed my first year. Probably closer to 700 with productivity, bonuses, etc. When I was looking there are plenty of opportunities to make more, especially if you're not picky about where you want to live. Money will be lower if you want to live in a major city or do academics. That is same case with GI or any specialty. That being said, I never considered another fellowship or specialty because I love Cardiology. My two cents, you have to pick something you'll like. You'll make a lot of money in either specialty. But as many others have alluded to, what the point if you hate what you do.
20. u/CaramelImpossible406 [score=6, created=2025-08-10T19:34:31]: Please quit now so the program can call another applicant please
21. u/lagniappe- [score=2, created=2025-08-10T19:16:46]: There’s plenty of outpatient only non invasive cardiology jobs with no call and high pay if that’s what you’re looking for. Cardiology is a great specialty, hopefully you choose it because you’re interested in Cardiology and not just dollars per hour. Plenty of people would love to have your spot.
