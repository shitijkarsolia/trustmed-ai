===============================================================================

To other community noninvasive general cardiologists out there - wondering what your set up is like. Mine is generally 3.5 days of clinic and 1 day of reading time (echo, nuc) per week. Full clinic day is 16 patients. There is some MA/RN support for inbox management. Call is 1 in 6, including 1 in 6 nights and 1 in 6 inpatient call for a week at a time. No midlevel support in hospital.

Inpatient on weekdays 20-50 census split between 2 docs. APPs write initial consult notes for everyone and we see follow ups on our own. Split hospital imaging and procedures between you and the other guy on. Call 1:6 weekends, but you only do overnight call for one of the nights. Round on census of 20-45 + echo + stress on the weekends. APPs are in house and take first call. Call 1:15 for weeknights. APPs are in house and take first call. 5 weeks vacation, 1 week CME 500 base + production, ends up being around 700-750/yr This is 30 min drive from a major city (top 5-8 metro area by population)
2. u/pantless_doctor [score=8, created=2025-08-16T05:55:19]: This sounds quite light to me. But I also feel clinic is a time suck and can expand to fill the whole day. Do you/can you break up the clinic to half days and mix with imaging? 20 echos shouldn’t take you very long (3-4 hours), but are super monotonous so helps if you break up to read rather than just sit and read echos all day. Also you say no admin time but only work 4.5 days? That last 0.5 is basically admin… I assume you are salaried?
3. u/CardiacMyocyte [score=10, created=2025-08-15T21:07:49]: Idk what median pay means. You expect us to give you feedback without all information lol
4. u/[deleted] [score=4, created=2025-08-16T07:54:45]: Bruh a clinic day of 16 is super light lol what. 3rd year fellows see up to 10 patients per half day at my program. 2nd years see 8. 1st years start at 4 their first three months than ramp up to 6. My attendings on their non fellow precepting days see anywhere from 24-32 patients a day. The 5 weeks PTO is light, though if you game it with some BS conference the week CME is also vacation. If there's no RVU incentive then don't work hard. I'd only address mychart messages at work in between patients. Or ask for 1/2 day admin time during the next contract negotiation. What's the inpatient week like? Are you primary or is a hospitalist primary on everything. Do you have to do any procedures or just round and write the note. What about any emergencies overnight like Stemi, tamponade, VT storm. Do you have to physically come in and evaluate or send to the ICU and have the interventionalist deal with it? I don't think it's the best job set up but it's definitely not the worse. Clinic time is really light. You just need to stop caring and putting in more effort than you need to. Anxious patient bugging you? They make an appointment. I don't deal with that over the phone. That's how I do it in fellow's clinic. Patient's want to go over their echo and stress test on the phone? Nah, you'll follow up in 4 weeks and if everything is good then we don't need to see each other anymore. But i'm not trying to fit you in during my busy cath month and spend 30 minutes on the phone with you.
5. u/gatorblazerdoc [score=2, created=2025-08-16T09:35:56]: Medium sized PP in a medium sized city. 18-24 patients each clinic day with imaging mixed in through the day, no dedicated imaging days. I do 4.5 days a week because I really wanted that extra time to catch up with the inbox and duck out for an early Friday if possible. Call is mostly concentrated in your inpatient consult weeks which is roughly 1 in every 6. Everyone’s experience is a little different since APP support is paid out of pocket and makes a big difference on your “scut” workload since they help manage the inbox for your practice, write the notes and put in orders while inpatient, and generally generate a lot more imaging for you to read. I haven’t hired an APP yet and feel pretty busy with this set up and do 900-1k RVU a month. Up to 6 weeks off but since it’s production based if you’re not working you’re not earning and I think people usually take less than what’s “allowed”.
6. u/jiklkfd578 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T20:50:56]: How many weeks off? Pay? Otherwise that appears to be a fairly standard employed set-up workload wise. More dedicated reading days than I typically see. Less APP support than you typically see.
7. u/Watchmaker2014 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T23:11:50]: What’s the salary structure like?
8. u/doc2025 [score=1, created=2025-08-16T07:40:34]: Yeah sounds light overall. I see 25-26 patients a day with no dedicated time to read studies (have to read after seeing patients). Call is lighter for me (2-3x a month) with 6-7 weekends a year. Seems like inbox management is causing burn out. Ask for AI scribe to help decrease writing note burden or ancillary help with calling patients or helping with inbox. Try to minimize as much work you take home it leads to burn out. Other option is do 4 day clinical work week on non hospital weeks or some administrative time and increase to 18-20 patients/day to make up for day off and keep volume same. Ask now and if they say no then definitely ask for your next contract. Salary is in line with median. Could make more but then would have to work harder. What are your clinic hours like during the day?
9. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-08-16T09:27:51]: I think it's the inbox and calls (while on call or not). And maybe even difficult clinic patients? Is inpatient a dedicated day and are you primary or just consultant? I've never had to go in for a call and get woken up by calls maybe 2-4x per year. I do 18-20 mostly easy patients a day which feels just about right. I don't have dedicated echo or inpatient days and I'm not primary and no support. I can see how yours seems like a decent gig on the surface, and it's not terrible, but everyone always just focuses on pay, call, vacation (as evidenced by some comments here) but it's these other details that really matter. Call intensity, hospital culture, support, patient population, etc. Talk to your colleagues. Is their load, support and stressors the same? Are you alone in your feelings? Can something be changed? Is it time to start looking for a different job?
10. u/DisposableServant [score=1, created=2025-08-16T12:39:08]: Bro wtf you comparing for? That’s a golden opportunity you got there. You’re doing half the amount of work of a cardiologist in the northeast for like almost the same pay.
