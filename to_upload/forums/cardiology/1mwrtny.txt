===============================================================================

Hello, I’m looking for a little advice. I’m 28 and have bounced around a bit in terms of careers/jobs. I have roughly 10 years of experience in management, both in foods and retail (supermarket/grocery). I’m now working as a unit clerk in a hospital. I’m currently reading about an EKG tech program and my friend (a nurse) suggested that I become a Cardiac Sonographer instead. Would it be advisable to start as an EKG tech, get some experience, and then go back to school for Cardiac Sonography? My goals like most people are to make a livable wage/be somewhat comfortable, be a productive member of a team/society, and stable work/life balance. I know that it’s never too late to start or restart, but I’d appreciate any insight and advice that you all can offer. Thanks in advance! Edit: I’d like to thank all of you for your advice and responses! I was not expecting this much information. I’ve been reading more and exploring other options based on all of your respective suggestions. Thank you all again, I greatly appreciate it!

2. u/zeey1 [score=15, created=2025-08-21T17:24:11]: Ekg tech is nothing major honestly you just hook up people ti get ekgs But sonography is much more, pay is better but you may not like it, you keed to figure out whether you would like doing ultrasounds or not on people
3. u/willdabeastest [score=12, created=2025-08-21T17:35:31]: Sonographer. I'm making 6 figures with 5 years experience in the US Southeast and I only work 4 days a week.
4. u/Ordinary-Ad5776 [score=10, created=2025-08-21T18:07:51]: Definitely sonographer. You will have skill set that is not easily replaceable by machine or by other healthcare workers. You will scan a lot and eventually be really good at it. If you work at an academic center you could be involved teaching cardiology fellows how to scan.
5. u/poulix [score=8, created=2025-08-23T00:25:42]: I’m going to say something that may come off as controversial because it seems like everyone else says sonography. I think it depends where you work/live. EKG tech scope of practice can be a lot more than just putting the stickers on for a 12-lead EKG (as others have suggested). EKG techs can also do ETT, MPI, event monitors, loop recorders, holter monitors, EP studies, pacemaker integration and more. It can be quite interesting and enjoyable. The pay between the jobs can be similar depending on where you live. Now doing sonography long term can be very damaging on your wrists. I would check the pay difference and scope of practice depending on where you live and decide based on that. I would also suggest doing a “shadow” day between both professions so you have a better!
6. u/HumanContract [score=5, created=2025-08-22T05:47:29]: Go to echo tech school. Ekg is learning on the job.
7. u/JulyKaiIII [score=4, created=2025-08-21T17:54:10]: I would say work as a unit clerk can go to school for cardiac sonography. I’m not sure about their pay, I do know they offer a good service, but I know for a fact a cardiac sonographer has a good income threshold. A two-year program is not bad at all. I’m sure you can go to school part-time as you continue to work as a clerk. May I advise looking into MRI as well? I think it’s kinda nice being able to do one patient at a time with not so many cases in the day. Plus, you have your own room and machine and patients always come down to you. You don’t have to be searching for them. Travel opportunities I believe exists for both. The reason I don’t recommend going for EKG tech is because why spend the money on a certification or degree you’re not going to use long-term.
8. u/terriyak1 [score=3, created=2025-08-21T17:44:46]: 100% cardiac sonographer
9. u/thesmartairhead [score=2, created=2025-08-22T08:39:17]: Be a cardiac sonographer. I love what I do and it’s a great career. You will have to know about ECG tracings and can learn that part of it during school and on the job. The money is great and the lifestyle is as well. I did my clinicals last year and work in a university hospital and see pathology that none of my classmates got or will get the chance to experience.
10. u/fishmakegoodpets [score=2, created=2025-08-23T16:16:53]: I'm currently working as an echocardiographer with an RDCS credential. I have an associates degree in echocardiography. I had no previous healthcare experience and this was my first "big girl" job when I was hired at the age of 27. I didn't have any trouble finding a job, but I had to be willing to move away from where my school was. I went to an accredited school. If you decide to go the sonography route, it needs to be an accredited school. Some programs require that you have previous health care experience and others don't. The programs that don't require it take a little longer to complete. This is not easy. For prerequisites I had to take physics, college algebra, and anatomy and physiology 1 and 2, among other courses. The actual program was 15 months and I essentially slept, ate, and breathed echo. My school only accepted 10 students every year, and only seven of us graduated. Two of those that graduated washed out of this career after a year. The students that were seniors above me only graduated with four out of 10. It is an emotionally, physically, and mentally taxing career. Schooling was even more so. I don't wish to discourage you from pursuing cardiac sonography, however, many of the commenters in this sub don't actually do cardiac sonography. I feel it's important that I do not sugarcoat it. AI is also a large concern in our field. Some commenters were speaking about job security, but that will change, inevitably, in the coming years. I'm already preparing to get my ACS credential so that I can be a more valuable member of our team. I want to keep my job. It's important to know that sonography in general has the highest muscoskeletal injury rate of any career. Most sonographers scan in pain or go home in pain every single day. The injury rates are around 98 to 99%. I love my job and it's been really good to me so far, but no one can make this choice for you. I think it's important to educate yourself on what an actual day in the life would be like for you to see if it lines up with what you want. If you're able to shadow an EKG tech and an echo tech, That might give you a good idea of what you might prefer. Honestly, if I could do it all over again, I would have gone the rad tech to nuc med route, or gone into nursing or physician's assisting.
11. u/brianmfellenbaum [score=2, created=2025-08-27T13:25:37]: Cardiac sonography . Work a permanent position for 3ish years then start traveling. That’s where the money is at . Can easily find contracts paying anywhere from $2500-$3500 a week .
12. u/LegendOfKhaos [score=2, created=2025-08-21T17:35:37]: Look into the long term effects of being a sonographer, but that's a good option. I went for the cath lab, but it's not any better for your body.
13. u/blueskycrf [score=1, created=2025-08-22T02:27:25]: Many places will have Cardiac Sonographers, Respiratory Therapy, or nursing cover for EKG techs on leave or may not have dedicated EKG techs. Do the work to get a degree. None of it’s easy but the you will have much better prospects. Sonographers that can relocate (especially travelers) can make great money.
14. u/someonesmom13 [score=1, created=2025-08-23T16:07:43]: I wouldn't waste your money on any course claiming to train you to be an "EKG technician." You can learn to do an EKG or apply a heart monitor in less than 5 minutes on the job. Good "echo techs," (sonographers who specialize in cardiac ultrasounds) are sought after and make better money, particularly as travelers. That's the better education investment.
15. u/Show-Valuable [score=1, created=2025-08-25T10:59:08]: Cardiac sonography pays waaaay more and is in demand everywhere. EKG tech is a different job and a nurse can do it if you’re not there. A nurse can’t stand in for a sonographer. It’s too specialised. Get your degree and enjoy 12 hour shifts and a good life. Best of luck.
16. u/Boskouei [score=1, created=2025-08-25T21:37:18]: The two jobs are very different. Not even closely comparable. ECG is simple and can be taught in few hours at most, or minutes to say. For cardiac sonography you need to take proper school with physics, anatomy, heart physiology and more. Probably first become an ultrasound tech, such as you do kidney, liver etc, then more training is needed to do cardiac. I’d say each cardiac echo has 75-100 or more images and video clips. You also most likely have to do primary read so cardiologist can edit and finalize it later. It may take long minutes for each case. Usually you have to push the 300 lbs machine around the hospital to get to patients ( usually if not always) if you do pediatrics then it needs way more education on congenital disease anatomy and diagnosis. So you really need to have a passion to learn and do it. It is physically and mentally really demanding. You do it in awkward positions and have to pose the patients which are difficult ( too obese, attached to tubes and lines etc) many techs get arthritis or tendinitis in wrist , elbow, shoulder and waist only from doing the echo besides always pushing the machine. Some times you have to come back after hours at 3 AM to do a Stat or urgent case and actually help to make a diagnosis of say tamponade or RV strain, or a perforation … So duh, of course it gets better payment than ECG tech which I doubt needs much of a long training per se, I am a cardiologist so this is from my perspective. The reply by fishmaker*** above gives a better idea regarding training side of it .
