===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I am a medical student planning on going into IM and very much interested in cardiology. My question is regarding the variability of vacation built into employment contracts. not so much how much total time off is allowed, but rather regarding consecutive days and weeks off. I ask because I really like to do multi-day white water rafting trips with my family and I am curious how accessible time off for these sorts of adventures are in Cardiology across subspecialty and practice model. These trips usually include a week off at a time or perhaps more depending on the river. For example, the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon would be 3 weeks, the Middle Fork of the Salmon is maybe 10 days total, others are less like 1 week or as short as 4 days. If I went into Cardiology, would I be able to negotiate for these opportunities? or would I be giving them up? Some information I have been given is that if you are willing to accept a lower base compensation, the employer or group may be willing to accommodate coverage during these off periods. Can any of you confirm this is actually a practice in contract negotiation? If anyone has experience or anecdotal info from the rocky mountain west or pacific northwest, that is where I would like to practice eventually. Thanks in advance.

So, for example, if a partner is covering you, you would then be expected to cover your partner to pay them back.

Time away is, in theory, unlimited. Some docs take very little "PTO" and some take a lot. Of course that is reflected in their RVUs. It's generally not an issue if they want to take a week or two weeks off. Hospital coverage is more or less of an issue depending on several factors. Size of the group is a big one. For a smaller practice you will need to be more accommodating of your partners. Larger groups less so. Also subspeciality dependent. For our group, our docs spend a lot of time at the hospital baseline so when several are on PTO at once it is a major hassle to arrange coverage. For gen cards or any more clinic focused practice, this is less of an issue. Overall I think most attendings in any speciality have the ability to negotiate contracts with generous time away and if it's a priority for you you will make it happen.

Most practice settings - Vacations up to about 2 weeks are generally seen as reasonable. Longer than that gets tough, but is not impossible. Highly integrated systems or large groups in underserved areas - You can probably take more than 2 weeks at a time if you want. Most setups will require advanced notice for any prolonged vacation. So, if you are going to be gone for more than a day or two, you may need to give a month (or more) of notice.
