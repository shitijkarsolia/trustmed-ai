===============================================================================

- Been doing locums tenens (LT) for several years and as director of cath lab hired LT MDs for my large health system. - Have worked for a smattering of small LT companies and 2 of the largest, better known: Weatherby and CompHealth (now owned by the same group, BTW). - It is a mixed bag but in general a positive rewarding experience. - IC LT demand seems is increasing. Published data and personal experience, more calls / emails asking if available. - Reasons are multiple but include an overall shortage of IC MDs due to fellowship programs output not keeping up with demand, many IC left and did not return to the workforce after COVID, difficult replaceability with APPs, removal of prior restrictions which now allow for outpt cath labs, venture capital interest in the latter, etc. - Working for a 3rd party (hired by a LT company) is a good place to start. They take care of everything. Finding the assignment, help processing hospital credentialing, travel and stay arrangements, help obtaining a license in another state (when worth it for them and the contracting hospital). - Expect full malpractice coverage with tail provided by them also but no other benefits. - A typical arrangement is a base daily rate, currently ~ $2-3K/d + an hourly “after hour” or “call back” rate. - Devil is in the details. What a “day” is, is variable and often negotiable. E.g, a weekday “day” may consist of 9 hrs (8 am to 5 pm), after that or if you get called back to the hospital after that, the call-back rate kicks in for an additional ~ $300-400/hr. A weekend “day” is often but not always shorter. E.g. ~6 hrs. - Holidays are typically 1.5-2 X the daily base rate. - Lower / higher rates working less / more hours exist and are often negotiable depending on location, how soon you can start, the unmet needs of that hospital or group, your experience as IC and performance as prior LT MD for that company, expected call / work burden, if doing IC only or + gen cards, etc. - There are companies that specialize in “perm locums” jobs where you are contracted for 1 yr (or more) to go to the same place for 1-2 wks / mo on a permanent rotation with other 1-3 IC docs who may share a place and car for the duration of the contract. - If contracting directly with a hospital or group, ~3-4K/d are usual but there is more variability here as other factors are involved like if malpractice is offered or not, if you are a temporary “one-off” to fill for vacation or maternity leave or if you are committing to a recurrent gig few days a wk or more in advance. - Do not try to bypass a LT company after you have been introduced to a hospital by them or even if that hospital is using that same company and you are approached by them. You will not only be blacklisted (and now healthgroups own multiple companies) but then you would have probably signed a contract explicitly prohibiting so. They have deeper pockets and better lawyers than you do. - Assigned LT dates can be cancelled by either party. Usually at no penalty if notice given 2-7 day in advance. This cuts both ways. Shit happens and I have a one strike policy with a contracting hospital. I once got full payment for a weekend when on my way to the hospital they realized they had made a mistake and did not need me. That is rare but kudos to Weatherby who did that. My experience with them was excellent. - Working as a LT can be a challenge. As an IC you are often working in a hospital with no CT surgery back-up. You have to be tolerant, adaptable, and be comfortable bailing yourself out of tight spots. All while remaining professional and personable. When hiring IC MDs myself I have stopped calling some when my lab staff or ED docs reported them as grouchy. Honestly, the most challenging part sometimes is working with an EMR you are not used to. After all, in essence a cath lab is a cath lab and a stent looks the same in all places. - Unfortunately, and I am aware this is a gross generalization based on personal experience, IC MDs doing LT may sometimes be of subpar quality. You may get someone who could not hold a job or doing it past their prime, or jaded from burnout. There is also an inherent lack of commitment that is part of the temporary nature of LT. - Why do I do locums as IC? In brief, I find it fun. I enjoy the challenge. I often go to non-urban but beautiful places to do good work. I worked once with FEMA on a disaster area that found themselves with no IC on short notice. - The fact that you get paid handsomely to do that helps. It has given me a bit of a “fck you” cushion toward my current job, knowing that I can walk away from it and will be fine. I am also using it a path into near-future retirement. I did not want to start trying it right before. - Where to find IC LT jobs? I would start with said companies above but a simple google search would reveal hundreds of companies. Some smaller ones may even offer better deals. Some job gigs are offered to multiple companies at once, some are exclusive. Hope that helps. Good luck but do NOT message me with any followup, offers or questions. They will all be ignored, blocked, deleted, and I will put a curse on you so that your stents do not cross and your groins bleed.

A cardiogenic shock patient as your first case at 2 am with a staff you don’t know, equipment that you don’t know or that is lacking, an EMR that sucks (as you highlighted) and a transfer process that you are unfamiliar with can be a huge headache or worse. Honestly 3k a day or $125/hr for that is laughable imo, especially when you compare that to locums market of other specialities right now (anesthesia)
3. u/Popular_Jeweler [score=4, created=2025-08-30T10:12:52]: Thanks for sharing! I'm non-invasive, currently making $2200/day + $300/hour for anything after 8 hours. Do you have any idea what the rates are for non-invasive cards?
4. u/chummybears [score=2, created=2025-08-30T07:09:33]: Thank you, this is very useful as an IC thinking about picking up LTs..
5. u/Grandbrother [score=2, created=2025-08-30T11:05:10]: Can it be done as an adjunct to full time practice? For instance on free weekends or holidays only?
6. u/Docdad30 [score=1, created=2025-08-30T13:20:29]: Thank you for your insights. So I have done hospitalist locums for many years and now doing Cardiology Fellowship with plans to do IC. IC Cardiology locums don’t seem too attractive from financial perspective compared to full time IC Cardiology jobs. For example an internist/hospitalist in smaller area will make close to 300K/year. But if you do locums working similar shifts you can probably 100-150 K extra, ofcourse you are going to smaller places. On the contrary IC cardiology full time in smaller area can make close to 700-800, vs doing locums from numbers above, you are making way less and ofcourse cons are you are away from home/family and sometimes in the middle of nowhere. I would expect per hour for IC to be double of hospitalist honestly, which doesn’t seem to be the case.
7. u/CaramelImpossible406 [score=1, created=2025-08-31T09:00:37]: I just think that rate is way less for a LT position. Thanks
8. u/Serious-Brick-422 [score=1, created=2025-09-01T09:42:11]: How reasonable you think is to make 30 k a week as IC LT?
