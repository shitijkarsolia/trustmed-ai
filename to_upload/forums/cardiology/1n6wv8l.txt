His YouTube lectures seem so easy to follow and enjoyable that I started having "too good to be true" doubts. I'm wondering what do interventional people on here think about his teaching series. Also would appreciate if you have some other cool resources to share for someone starting a cath lab rotation

2. u/Onion01 [score=11, created=2025-09-02T16:27:46]: He is excellent. Very detailed, might be overwhelming, but excellent resource nonetheless
3. u/Furqan23 [score=6, created=2025-09-02T15:07:50]: I’m hoping this is helpful advice I am not aware of this series so I can’t comment on that specifically But as general advice I would try to nail down the different views in Cath lab, and what views show what aspect of different vessels Not sure how it works at your institution but my first time through the primary focus was knowing the views and obtaining access. Much of the rest of it just comes through muscle memory and knowing how to move with purpose but also not rushing things. Check all your connections, triple check there’s no air, and have fun
4. u/FoolYa [score=3, created=2025-09-02T19:03:01]: He is very good but I think its probably a bit much for your first month. Focus on perfect access (femoral, radial, IJ) and learning the views. I assume you are a first year so you will probably have an upper level (or attending) in the case with you as second operator. Never push against resistance, stop when the upper level/attending says stop, always keep your eyes on the monitors and pt. Seems basic but you really should master all those things before you start doing anything else.

6. u/rads2riches [score=2, created=2025-09-02T15:16:05]: Great overview especially if you are green. No downside but time
