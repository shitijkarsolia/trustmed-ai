Even if a topic was suggested to me, if I was not all in I can't imagine spending that much of my free time on it. I would want it to be a segment I am not 100% fully educated in yet and will add to my personal growth or community impact. Just to spark some ideas: Depending on the parameters you could focus on medical device based, holistic based treatment strategies (including even mental health for patients/staff/physicians), course development on delivery of difficult news to patients and their families, process improvements, find a non profit to support - could your research impact meaningful change in something they're already trying to do?
