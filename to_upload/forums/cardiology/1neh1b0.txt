Hi everyone, I’m a finalyear medical student interested in cardiology, and I’ll be applying to hospitals for a cardiology position later this year. I’d like to strengthen my CV specifically in this field. The challenge is that right now I only have time for online opportunities that I can do from my computer. Do you have any suggestions on what I could do that would meaningfully improve my CV for cardiology (e.g., research projects, online courses, volunteering, etc.)? Any advice or personal experiences would be really appreciated!

That should be your focus right now if you want to match into a great cardiology fellowship down the road. If you want to learn a few skills now, that would be helpful. I would recommend that you spend some time at your computer getting very very good at reading ECG. That is a skill you can definitely master as a medical student and it will help you throughout your career.
