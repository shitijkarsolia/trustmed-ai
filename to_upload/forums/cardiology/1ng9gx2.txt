===============================================================================

I’m a new grad acute care NP. I worked ten years in CVICU and eight concurrently as an ECMO specialist before graduating. I just started as an APP with our Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant service, and I’m looking for structured programs to guide my studying. I joined HFSA, and I was looking both at their HF-cert bootcamp and the on demand board review program from their in-person review last year. I also was considering the ACC SAP for heart failure. I’m looking for any guidance on which of these (or any others!) would be the best bang for my buck and appropriate for my level. Thanks so much!

2. u/noltey22 [score=7, created=2025-09-13T19:29:25]: As a AHFTx specialist I think there is a real dearth of standardized material out there to learn from. Now that being said this area is rapidly growing. Both the ACC and HFSA have a lot of online stuff and course material which is available if you have access to those websites. I don’t think there’s a gold standard textbook or anything. As others have mentioned really knowing the HF and CS guidelines like the back of your hand can go a long way too
3. u/Brave_Union9577 [score=2, created=2025-09-14T22:55:12]: You have already got a strong clinical base, start with mastering the HF guidelines cold, then build up with HFSA or ACC resources as needed. No need to drop $1500 right away.
4. u/sovook [score=3, created=2025-09-13T15:49:15]: I was dying of curiosity to see what chat GPT would respond with, here you are: What I’d recommend for the “best bang for your buck” Given all that, here’s what I’d lean toward for someone in your position (new NP in HF/transplant) weighing cost, time, and benefit — plus some strategy suggestions. Start with the ACC HF SAP (or at least pick up the modules)** if you can afford it (member price).** Use it as your “backbone”: go through the modules systematically. Use the practice questions to find weak areas. Because ACC updates its content yearly and covers all the transplant / MCS / guideline shifts, you’ll stay current. Even if you don’t need certification, this gives you confidence and covers breadth. Simultaneously gear up for HFSA HF‑Cert, or plan to sit for it in 6‑12 months: Use the ACC SAP to help prepare for HFSA exam: fill in any gaps. Do the HFSA bootcamp / board review (on‑demand) to reinforce exam‑style content. That will help with test strategy and picking up high‑yield topics. If cost is a concern, pick selectively: You may not need both full ACC SAP + full HFSA bootcamp at once. Depending on your schedule / employer support, you could maybe alternate or do parts. Use free / lower‑cost offerings: some pilot CMP‐versions, open webinars, review articles, guideline updates (HFSA, ACC, AHA) etc. In your first few months in practice, tailor your study plan: Keep a journal/log of cases you see that stretch you (e.g. transplant rejections, LVAD complications, outpatient GDMT titrations). In those domains, do targeted reading / sessions. Attend multidisciplinary HF rounds, transplant meetings, shadow transplant cardiologists, pharmacists, immunologists etc. Learning from practice is powerful. Consider your employer / institution support: Does your institution pay for CME / certification / subscriptions? Could they get you ACC membership / SAP access? Are there internal credentialing / promotion benefits to HFSA HF‑Cert in your center? Other programs / resources you might consider Here are some additional programs or resources that might be helpful extras: HFSA’s Optimal Medical Therapy in Heart Failure (OMT‑HF) Certificate Program — specifically focused on guideline‑driven medical therapy, which is often one of the biggest gaps. Heart Failure Society of America Mayo Clinic / CVEducation “Heart Failure Management for NP, PA, and Primary Care Providers” — sometimes offered as in‑person / livestream workshops. Good for interactive learning. cveducation.mayo.edu Recent guideline documents (ACC/AHA/HFSA) &amp; consensus statements (e.g. on myocarditis, HFpEF) – stay up to date. Case‑based learning: attending transplant/advanced HF conferences, webinars; reading “Cardiac Failure Review” / “Journal of Cardiac Failure” etc. Mentorship: having a transplant cardiologist or advanced HF physician or senior NP/PA to review cases with you, discuss decision‑making rationales. My suggestion: what I would do if I were you If I were starting your role, here’s what I’d plan: Purchase ACC HF SAP (5‑year membership if possible but maybe 1‑year if budget or time limited), and work through it gradually (maybe 1 topic per month or more depending on workload). Register for HFSA HF‑Cert exam window that is ~9‑12 months out, giving myself time to prepare with SAP plus supplement with HFSA bootcamp or on‑demand review. Use OMT‑HF certificate to shore up outpatient GDMT, which is important. Combine reading key guideline updates as soon as they come out, attend transplant / device rounds, perhaps find a case conference series.

7. u/HumanContract [score=1, created=2025-09-14T00:47:45]: Idk who these ppl are who think nurses know nothing. As another CVICU RN who has also been a nurse for 10+ years in MANY specialties, and working with ECMO, it comes as a surprise to see ppl who think we know nothing. Most fellows covering these populations still make simple but deadly mistakes, all the time, right up to their being hired as an attending. I don't think treating nurses as idiots helps anyone. Lord knows being a doctor doesn't mean the person with the schooling or training actually knows what they're doing and is still learning. Good for you for seeking education!
