===============================================================================

Since before I was a pre-med I have been really interested in cardiology and that has only increased throughout medical school. I really like that you can make a real difference in people's lives and it is intellectually fascinating. Now as an M3 working on a cardiology device research project, I have learned about up and coming AI devices that can read EKG and perhaps even echoes as well as or better than human cardiologists. I haven't seen any of the highly accurate ones used clinically yet where I have shadowed, but I think it is coming soon. A lot of the risk stratification and medical management seems to follow algorithms from large studies, which could also be taken over by AI. In a psych study, patients found the AI more empathetic than human physicians so AI could even take over the communication aspect. I still have two more years of medical school, three years of internal medicine, and three years of general cardiology (if I match) - also was considering EP or IC (so 1-2 more years). So 8-10 more years before I could even start practicing and AI will probably only get better by then. Where do you see the future of the practice of cardiology heading with AI long-term?

Surgeons losing ground to noninvasive techniques, algorithmaztion and the ride of APPs moving everyone to formulaic medicine, etc etc. there are several areas in which I believe cardiology will remain robust moving forward. The most important will be procedure techniques, especially if you wanna be an interventional cardiologist or an electrophysiologist. Now interventional cardiology will and has been losing volume in regards to step placement, but that has been mitigated somewhat by the rise of structural cardiology. Despite lower reimbursement rates, EP remains a robust field, both for device placement, as well as the ever-expanding rule of ablation. And even if you didn’t want to be in a procedural base field, there will remain for the foreseeable future a strong need for cardiology imagers. This is not to say that AI won’t have an impact on the field, but I would challenge you to find an area of medicine that won’t be impacted.

3. u/pills_here [score=11, created=2025-09-18T16:40:15]: I think there will be a period when AI makes us all more productive, followed by a period when it threatens the workforce, at which point society will be forced to change. If this happens it will affect just about every job in the world.
4. u/diffferentday [score=12, created=2025-09-18T17:17:37]: To be fair, as a cardiac EP, I feel like cardiologists actually suck at EKG reads because they're overstretched and just want to click through them fast.
5. u/FLCardio [score=9, created=2025-09-18T18:42:50]: As long as there are lawyers and threat of lawsuits there will be a constant supply of business to keep General cardiologists busy with chest pain and pre-op evals.
6. u/TomNgMD [score=5, created=2025-09-18T17:35:10]: Medicine is the slowest field to adopt new tech. Hca hospital still use meditech with window 98 interface.
7. u/statinsinwatersupply [score=13, created=2025-09-18T15:19:09]: Bruh / dear sir or madman yes cardiologists can read EKGs very well. But when they're getting stretched 7 kinds of sideways by so many different responsibilities, signing things in MUSE is the literal least important job. Unfortunately this often results in just automatically clicking sign without actually changing what the computer put there. Usually this is fine because clicking sign just generates a bill and the actual clinician the day of looked at the EKG which most likely didn't change clinical care. BUT every once in a while the computer is dead wrong, and the dead tired cardiologist didn't catch it, and the clinician the day of can't read the EKGs and something gets missed. Everyone has that meeting back in the day with the manager with the uncomfortable "um did you mean to click sign when the computer read asystole" or somesuch. (Or there's the apocryphal or not-so-apocryphal ahem tale of too many cardiologists retiring, the EKG backlog getting crazy, and some dead tired guy builds a python script to auto-click sign on tens of thousands of EKGs in one night and then EPIC flagged it as unusual, investigation ensues) AI isn't directly competing with cardiologists. What it's gonna do is help shit not accidentally fall through the gaps. Still, my confidence that the machine will be able to read EKGs, much less dynamic imaging like echos well, is very very low. I'll believe it when I see it.
8. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=4, created=2025-09-18T18:54:35]: Technology regularly affects all kinds of jobs and often displaces whole fields. Although AI is potentially positioned to be an order of magnitude more extreme, the reaction is the same: stay nimble and be open to adapt to new paradigms. If I had to predict the next 3-5 years, I would say that the biggest impact that AI will have on medicine will be on documentation (i.e. writing clinical notes efficiently that can be billed at a high level) and documentation review (i.e. insurance providers down-grading billing based on review of clinical documentation). I think medical careers will be less affected by AI than most other jobs.

11. u/cardsguy2018 [score=3, created=2025-09-19T13:13:08]: Probably helping out with notes, paperwork, maybe assisting ekg and imaging but not 100% and so on. Risk and management isn't the hard part or take much time, AI or not, but communication is. People want to interact with humans, with doctors. Maybe AI could replace some of the crappier doctors out there or serve certain types of people, maybe the same people that like self-checkout. But there's still a lot of people that like to wait for the human cashier.
12. u/DisposableServant [score=4, created=2025-09-18T19:04:57]: You have too much time on your hands. You’re going to perseverate about what ifs and hypotheticals no matter what field you choose to go into. Nothing is guaranteed for any field, CRNAs are forever encroaching on anesthesia, AI was taking over radiology for years, CT surgery is extinct because of interventional, ophtho is no longer part of ROAD because of CMS cuts. At the end of the day the payment landscape is gonna be drastically different by the time you graduate med school and finish 6-7 years of training. Just pick what you’re interested in and go with it!
13. u/jiklkfd578 [score=5, created=2025-09-18T15:05:52]: Cardiology, especially IC and EP, will be one of, if not the last to fall. You won’t find a specialty with more security outside maybe neurosurgery. I can’t wait until AI can read echos and the likes.
14. u/UnhappyWater4285 [score=2, created=2025-09-18T19:19:18]: Adding to what has been already said ; the rule states if a physician spends less effort and time to finish a task whatever it is : clinical encounter , study , procedure ,etc , that translates into less number of wRVUs to be assigned to that task . AI and advanced procedural technology will make it easier for you to read images , see patients and write notes , interventions also will take much less time in the future etc . And that simply means less reimbursement which means you have to work harder to collect the same wRVUs you used to get before AI
15. u/CORNROWKENNY1 [score=2, created=2025-09-18T20:07:51]: This guy is a med student. He has no idea what yall are talking about regarding ripping through ekgs on muse and billing for them. He has never heard of muse. OP, cardiologists are excellent at reading ekgs and in 2025, it is an extremely important part of their job and helps patients immensely. Helps other docs. Saves lives.
16. u/TuningForkUponStar [score=2, created=2025-10-05T08:45:01]: Hard to know what will be possible and when, but computer interpretation of ECGs is terrible at this point, and computer interpretation of echoes will be at least an order of magnitude more difficult. In any event if you do IC or EP, you'll be doing procedures, and it will be a very long time before AI-controlled robots will be doing those procedures.
17. u/FoolYa [score=1, created=2025-09-18T18:18:03]: Dude people have been saying AI is going to replace radiologists back when I was a med student a decade ago. Still never happened. What is more likely to happen is for midlevels to replace/reduce certain fields, that actually has happened—EM is a great example. At the end of the day someone needs to be sued when something bad happens, until AI can be sued we are safe. Just pick what you like and understand that all fields will go through times where they need to adapt.
18. u/babar001 [score=1, created=2025-09-18T22:44:25]: I don't need AI to read my EKG and echo, or maybe the one I cannot read myself. And the AI has "read" : what now ? I still need to deal with the patient. For the one saying procedures are safer, i really don't see why.
