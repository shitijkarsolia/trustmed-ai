Hi all, Wondering what experiences others have had - I’m a fellow at a fairly well-known program. I’m applying to non-invasive jobs right now, and everyone has told me that the job market is hot. I’m having trouble getting replies from the academic places I’ve emailed (the chairs). Strong interest from private groups. I’m interested in clinical roles, which again, I thought was in demand. Do these places just move more slowly in terms of replies? It’s been about three weeks since I emailed, and my program director send them a strong recommendation/nudge 4-5 days ago. Seeking any wisdom from those who have been through this. Should I just keep looking at other opportunities at this point? Is it common to just get ghosted?

They are large organizations, with complex politics, and often internal dissonance on who/what/when they want to hire. Connections and patience with a bit of persistence (but not too much) are all you can really do. If you don’t have solid leads by December, start interviewing with private groups. Everyone moves at wildly different paces, which is one of the toughest aspects to this process. That’s why they made the NRMP match for trainees.

Academics on the other hand either silent or pointing out deficiencies. Academic appointments are serious things, track to professor is crazy job security and with a training program your jobs become easier despite the less pay. Just not sure if its worth the hassle vs private practice.

5. u/Brilliant_Hamster870 [score=1, created=2025-09-29T19:31:50]: Last year around this time, pretty much every academic institution was desperate for a non-invasive person. I doubt that trend has changed. Honestly, academic places struggle the most with hiring generalists; they usually want hyper-specialized folks, so the generalist ends up feeling underappreciated. And don’t even get me started on the horrendous salaries. What region are you looking at?
6. u/br0mer [score=1, created=2025-09-30T13:55:33]: Academics moves slower and is generally less interested in a new grad with minimal research. I had the same response a few years ago. I would get an interview within 2 weeks of messaging community groups and 2+ months for academics. In general, academics will pay 50th percentile or less, while community shops are 75th+ percentile if you want it. My job currently is 80-90th percentile depending on productivity.
7. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-09-23T09:44:22]: I'm confused what the problem is and what you want. Do you want to work in academics and they're not being responsive? But PP is responsive but you don't want to work there? Yeah, academics and large institutions can be slow, but I wouldn't keep waiting around. Keep looking and give yourself as many options as you can.
