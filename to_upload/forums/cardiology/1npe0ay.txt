===============================================================================

Hello, I need your help please. My friend is applying for an IC fellowship and asked for my opinion about Brigham Harvard, Mayo vs Henry Ford. She needs help deciding which one to rank first. I am a bit biased toward HFH because of the excellent exposure, but Harvard and Yale also have strong training and a great name. What are your thoughts? Thanks!

2. u/one_plain_slice [score=12, created=2025-09-24T11:13:08]: Harvard STEMI volume will probably be lower than the other two (a lot of STEMI centers in the small area of Boston proper). HFH has great exposure to shock / CHIP. I assume Mayo as well since they’re the only shop in town, just not as familiar w it.
3. u/cardsguy2018 [score=5, created=2025-09-24T09:49:19]: Well she interviewed there, what did she think? Likely won't be a big difference in the grand scheme of things. Where does she want to live for 1yr+? Where does she want to work?
4. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=5, created=2025-09-24T17:14:45]: It depends what she wants. These are all big famous hospital. For IC specifically, I don't think that matters very much. You want to be at a big busy hospital with lots of cases that allows the fellows to do most of the case. At least two of these programs are not that. They are famous, but have too many fellows for too few IC cases. The things that are most important for IC training (in order) are... 1. How many cases a fellow can meaningfully participate in during year 1. 2. Is the program set up to get you a job where you want to end up (usually: in the same region). 3. Does the program allow you to complete any specific additional training and/or research involvement that you really want (peripheral, structural). This is not a factor for most people. 4. Is the training experience good. 5. (Maybe) the institution's national prestige.
5. u/Mustafa_3questions [score=3, created=2025-09-24T13:21:21]: If they did their general cards fellowship at any of those three, then that should take the one slot in ranking. Whether they say it up front or not, shops might show favoritism towards in-house prospects due to less of a training hurdle when it comes to protocols and guidelines. All three would be good options.
6. u/WSUMED2022 [score=3, created=2025-09-24T18:26:35]: HFH is big on CTOs/complex PCI if that's your thing.
7. u/TheWizardPenguin [score=2, created=2025-09-24T19:41:14]: I interviewed at many of those programs few years back. It really depends on what she is looking for after. And this is really the time to be honest with one self. Is she aiming for academic IC afterwards (usually 1-2 days in lab) balanced with research? Then BWH all the way. However volume will be an issue. I trained towards the tail end of Covid years and I can say many Boston programs couldn’t even meet the minimum for interventions. Another issue with BWH is that they have a second year fellowship for CHIP so all the cool cases goes to them. When there are no cool cases, they might take over some of yours because of seniority. HFH is a very arduous year but you will see the most, take care of the sickest, and can be exposed and see the most in one year including structural. It’s great if you’re joining a community/private practice; if you’re aiming to do research or stay in academics, prob not ad useful as there will be “some other expert” for those sick patients.
8. u/ChardQuirky8040 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T12:33:49]: Henry Ford is in Detroit! It’s a good program, but keep in mind location sucks! I would rank it least.
