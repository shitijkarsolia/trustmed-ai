Esteemed EP's and Cardiologists. I'm a retired Biomedical Engineering professional looking for some history on the **Electronics for Medicine** cardiology systems used between the 70's- 90's in major hospitals, Cardiology labs, and CCU's. Wiki, AI, and forums are showing up dry in my search. I know many of you and our senior medical docs have used these systems. You all mostly likely remember the E for M VR-6 with high speed recorder. I'm looking for photos, and if lucky, documentation. You can share on this post or PM me for more info I want to build some historical context on this amazing technology we developed in the analog/digital transformational age of electronics. Any help or leads will be appreciated. This technology was a mere 40 years ago. We should keep some history on this. Thanks
