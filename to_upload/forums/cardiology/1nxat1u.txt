===============================================================================

Third year fellow and I struggle to read echos quickly I passed my boards and I can read a normal echo in 10-15 minutes… granted we have techs that do the write ups for us - however I still try to do my own measurements (at least early in my training or for complex echos) However I find that on a given 8 hr day I can only read about 12-16 echos… afterwards I mentally tap out I also want to point out that usually the first half of the day I have more energy and can read lots of echos but the second half I spend more time on echos due to mental fatigue Is this normal? Jobs I am looking at are requiring me to read 25-40 echos on a reading day… this is excluding TEEs and pt messages, etc

And then he’d say “what’d you see? Did you see the posterior leaflet prolapse? The questionable echo density at the apex? The mild IVC dilation?” etc etc etc, he’d rattle off a bunch of stuff. And then go through it more slowly and yeah, it was all there. I’m now over a decade into reading echoes solo and I’m not even remotely THAT fast but I’m approximately ten times faster than I was at the beginning. You’ll get there.
2. u/[deleted] [score=10, created=2025-10-03T19:27:09]: As an echo tech observing, I’m amazed at how the 110+ image study I spent 45 minutes on can be finalized 5 minutes after I assign it. The perfectionists mull over small details and comment on every little thing. I know docs who have been reading echoes for 12+ years, yet often stay hours late reading. The others seem to brush the big strokes and get back to their families at a reasonable hour 🤷‍♀️ The latter approach doesn’t make me feel as appreciated (lol), but I understand both are valid for their own reasons. It seems to be a spectrum, a balance of speed and quality led by the individual’s tolerances.

There's honestly like 5-6 things that matter on an echo and everything else is mental masturbation. EF/LV size, valve function, effusion, wall motion, vegetations will give 95%+ of all echoes you'll ever read. If you get these down, you'll be fine. Will you miss diastolic MR in someone with CHB? Maybe, but it's also clinically useless. Diastology is very much clinically useless. Once you mentally pare down what is important and what's not, you can crank through many more echoes. Last weekend I was on call, I read like 25 echoes each Saturday and Sunday and it didn't take more than a few hours.

5. u/genericuser202 [score=3, created=2025-10-04T00:12:24]: Crazy how it works in different countries. We do our echos ourselves and I manage about 15-20 a day on average, maybe less if there are some stress-echos. But it’s very mentally taxing and I’m also not that concentrated for the later ones. And I’m always happy when there are some quick normal echos in between.
6. u/beltlinelover [score=2, created=2025-10-04T08:46:42]: I work in a high volume hospital, the reading cardiologist will read 50-65 echoes per day. 10-15 minutes read time per echo is too long. We the echo techs write the physicians impressions for them. The readers spend an average of 5-10 minutes per echo to read. You can blow through the normals faster and spend more time reading the serious pathology. You can find out if your cardiology department offers help to share the load with your coworkers reading also. Reading 12-16 echoes per day is just not gonna cut it in today’s high volume American health care system. Try to pick up your reading times. The majority of echoes done are normal anyway. Sorry to be a such a downer. I’m in my 20th year as an echo tech at this high volume hospital and if you can only read less than 20 echoes per day, you’re not gonna make it, only if you work at a low volume facility. Plenty of those exist.
7. u/DisposableServant [score=2, created=2025-10-04T12:31:50]: It just comes with more volume, the more you do the easier it gets and you realize what actually matters and what doesn’t.
8. u/zeey1 [score=3, created=2025-10-03T17:45:12]: You absolutely can't read more then 15 echos if you are generally trying to be honest.. simply not possible But then you do realize that an echo is paid less the ruvu so you aren't getting paid more then 50$ in most places If we treat RVU as 50$ reimbursement which it is in most places
9. u/checkinginagain [score=1, created=2025-10-04T02:04:46]: As someone with a congenital heart defect that relies on you guys this is very interesting. I never put it into dollars and cents before but I get it. Thanks for all you guys do.
