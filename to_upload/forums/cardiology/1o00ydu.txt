===============================================================================

Hi all. Wanted to get some thoughts on fellow IC’s who have any experience with the refinity IVUS catheter and syncvision. Is syncvision truly helpful or is it just cumbersome? I’m faced with the decision on switching our lab’s IVUS catheter to Boston (with large capital expense) vs. keeping volcano and obtaining syncvision (for free). If anybody can share their opinion on syncvision that would be great.

Boston: smaller crossing profile, however flimsy with no pushability. Volcano: larger crossing profile, however more support and may cross stubborn areas. Volcano is manual pullback only. The sled with Boston IVUS is nice, but around 20% of the time I will do manual pullback. Also it takes longer to set up and is more cumbersome. I don't trust the lengths that the sled will provide sometimes it's off. Also consider artifacts. Boston IVUS is rotational, so you can get NURD artifact in tortuous vessels. Volcano is a phased array so you don't get the NURD artifact. Due to the rotational system you need to flush the Boston IVUS to get bubbles out and sometimes have to flush during imaging to clean up the image, this is not needed in phased array IVUS. Volcano you can get ring artifacts so you need to ring down in healthy lumen. I use both, but use Boston more often, but not for any clear reason. I'll use whatever I have in the room. Boston has better images but more cumbersome to deal with. Volcano is more straight forward with not as good of an image.

Coregistration is hit or miss, and mostly the latter. Bosci is more deliverable and the hd is much better quality pictures for information more than just sizing. It’s more deliverable and from what I remember from fellowship the sled does a nice controlled pull back with coregistration on there as well. I use ivus for 90% of my pcis and my shop only has volcano so I’ve gotten used to it.
3. u/dayinthewarmsun [score=3, created=2025-10-06T19:49:49]: Boston is probably the best all-around IVUS in the USA and Volcano Refinity is probably the all-around worst (volcano EagleEye is in competition for that title, but at least it is quick). For best image quality, I think Makoto and ACIST have great real-world results. However I don’t find them to be much better than Boston and they are certainly not as durable, convenient or well-supported…so Boston still wins best “all around” in US. Synchvision is neat, but I find balloon sizing or measuring pullback length by looking at the IVUS images more reassuring and don’t generally feel that I need a drawn map. I don’t think I would make a decision to get significantly worse imaging because of added features like this.
4. u/Creepysarcasticgeek [score=2, created=2025-10-06T18:09:24]: Boston HDIVUS is night and day compared to Philips. We have both and the eagle eye is nice for quick in and out here and there. HDIVUS has been truly a game changer in image quality. Syncvision and coregistration is a gimmick for IVUS in my opinion, it’s more helpful in their physiology and stent detection.
5. u/ProjectMew [score=2, created=2025-10-07T08:11:37]: IMO, once you get used to the Boston IVUS, it’s hard to go back to volcano. Theres just so much more detail and I’ve seen edge dissections on the Boston system that the Philips system missed. The one thing that Volcano has that Boston doesn’t is Chromaflo, if that’s a factor to you. Boston’s AI powered vessel sizing is pretty good
6. u/ChinitoIncognito [score=2, created=2025-10-08T03:37:56]: If your lab has OCT, does not make much sense to switch to Boston from Volcano IMO. Volcano is good enough for most cases and is much quicker to set up and use than Boston. If you need better image quality you can just use OCT.
7. u/Grandbrother [score=2, created=2025-10-12T21:11:53]: Boston with AVVIGO+ is chef's kiss. The images are fantastic - true HD IVUS - and the AI measurements are very good. I have found the lengths you get from automated pullback to be pretty good actually. I've only used that and Volcano solid state though. Never used Refinity. I'm sure they will catch up to Boston if they haven't already
8. u/nalsnals [score=1, created=2025-10-06T18:02:47]: No experience with the Philips system, but the latest Boston is pretty great image quality, good auto measuring and easy to use.
