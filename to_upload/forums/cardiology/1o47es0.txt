===============================================================================

This is being considered by my hospital system. I am aware of trials reporting shortening of D2B times. However, they seem to come at the expense of increasing false activation, especially when done in ‘real world’ circumstances. Also, under a certain time threshold (\~45-60) mins it seems further reductions in D2B time have limited benefit. We don’t allow most MDs with years of clinical experience to activate the cath lab, should well-meaning but less extensively trained first responders such as EMS techs be granted this capacity?

2. u/AssUpSatsUp [score=19, created=2025-10-11T15:01:46]: My shop did this and all it caused was unnecessary activations for very, very obvious pericarditis
3. u/Angiotensin [score=10, created=2025-10-11T14:55:45]: I think that’s a lot to ask of the paramedics / EMTs to make that call. Not a knock on their clinical skills by any means but I think from their perspective the bar to activate would be low and would mean more wake up calls for cath lab staff. I liked the system in place where I trained. ECGs in the field were transmitted to the ER docs, and emailed to a listserve with the IC docs. The ER could activate based on that, sometimes would call us first if they were on the fence. Either way it was nice for us to have a preview of what we were heading in for. Usually the transmissions were reviewed by the ER pretty quickly, and still could activate when the patient was 10-15 mins away.
4. u/Gideon511 [score=10, created=2025-10-11T15:48:05]: I have worked in both systems, with EMS activation door to balloon is significantly improved at cost of more false activations, to me worth it for the shorter door to balloon time
5. u/Creepysarcasticgeek [score=6, created=2025-10-11T15:29:52]: We had gone through this and back. A better term to use is inappropriate activations which we have seen an increase in, whereas false activation in many papers are defined as meeting criteria of chest pain + ecg but ending up being something else (pericarditis or takotsubos). Even though the paramedics had strict criteria, there’s often mis reading of the ECGs (lvh, lbbb and artifact) and other times it’s simply “he just looked cardiac” and the lab is activated. The hospital didn’t care until we translated into dollars. We are a high volume center for stemi and at 10-20% inappropriate activation it just wasn’t feasible. Many machines that paramedics use for monitoring have ecg transmission capability now and the best way is to connect it to a secure way to transmit to the IC directly followed by patching through a phone call to the IC.
6. u/idkcat23 [score=6, created=2025-10-11T16:23:01]: I’m on the EMS side- modern tech allows for transmission of the 12 lead to receiving facility. That transmission + a radio report w/symptoms allows the receiving facility to determine if they’re going to activate cath lab or not. Medics have a lot of cardiac training and most are good at using their judgement when choosing when to activate. EMS calls a STEMI alert, cards on call determines if we’re waking up cath lab immediately or not.
7. u/mark_peters [score=12, created=2025-10-11T14:53:55]: Paramedics can phone the interventionalist on call in Australia and discuss the case to activate pre hospital. There are very strict criteria such that only the ‘barn door’ stemis get called in this way but it does work well in the majority of cases. Any doubt and they get redirected to the ed for them to review. To be honest the quality of call/handover/assessment of the patient is often better from the paramedics in my opinion
8. u/largeforever [score=3, created=2025-10-11T19:46:07]: I’m a Paramedic, I’ve worked on these programs. Like you mention, this will decrease your D2B times but you’re gonna get a lot of false activations and pissed off lab teams. New Paramedics generally aren’t prepared to make the call (would you let an intern?), and there’s a high degree of variability in medic education in general. A better option is to have them transmit that EKG directly to the cath lab, or your designee in the ER. Stryker’s Lifenet can transmit directly to your computers, you just need IT to configure the software properly. If that fails it can send a fax and printout too.
9. u/PositivePeppercorn [score=2, created=2025-10-11T15:43:15]: From my experience, no way. That said an en route transmission of the EKG plus clinical story would be huge. Twiage is a company that does this.
10. u/pills_here [score=2, created=2025-10-11T16:16:03]: I did fellowship at a place where EMS activation is norm. They are mandated to activate based on the computer read of the ECG, even if they are well aware that the patient is a 20 yo with penetrating neck trauma. We cancelled 2/3 of the activations. Some nights the poor cath lab staff drive back and forth multiple times. It became a priority to cancel quickly. Granted in this flawed system, we probably cancelled 1/3 ED activations as well. I highly recommend against it.
11. u/jiklkfd578 [score=2, created=2025-10-11T17:53:09]: Nope. Most of those set-ups that I’ve been a part of have been a total disaster. Sure, transmit an ecg with a story and do field activations from there.
12. u/Toffeeheart [score=2, created=2025-10-11T21:46:06]: Paramedic here. First, I think it's important to recognize that the global umbrella of "EMS" covers an extremely wide range of education, scope of practice, quality assurance, etc. There are EMTs with less than a year of education who work on the ambulance part time with the fire department and are highly protocol-dependent; there are also intensive/advanced/critical care paramedics with postgraduate level education and well-developed clinical judgment, who are quite familiar (and practiced) with evidence-based ECG interpretation and relevant clinical guidelines. And lots in between. So I think the answer to this question depends at least partly on your local system. That being said, I work in a system where our Advanced Care Paramedics can transmit ECGs directly to an on-call IC and then call them directly to discuss the case. The IC can refuse it or activate the cath lab with us transporting directly there, bypassing the ED. We also perform prehospital thrombolysis and related pharmacology under their orders. This has worked well here for many years. Our data shows it has greatly improved DTB times and STEMI mortality.
13. u/Suddenly_Squidley [score=2, created=2025-10-12T00:12:46]: You’re gonna burn through your cath lab staff very easily if you implement this!
14. u/rads2riches [score=3, created=2025-10-11T14:46:35]: I feel like an advance STEMI cert add on is needed in EMS like a NRP-S type of cert. There is too much skill variety with some paramedics better than MDs and some that don’t know difference between inferior from posterior. I always thought a really challenging STEMI cert to activate cath lab would help with quarterly training and reviews with cath drs would be great but likely a pipe dream. Or just send 12 lead picture to IC on call is probably most efficient. Or maybe AI interpretation does it all like the queen of hearts app?
15. u/pleaseacceptthisone [score=7, created=2025-10-11T14:37:31]: Great use case for AI assistance. Look at PMcardio.
16. u/mmecr [score=5, created=2025-10-11T14:40:25]: NAD, but I work in a cath lab where EMS can call a STEMI code. I will say, over the last 5 years that I've been there, I have had maybe one activation by EMS that wasn't a STEMI. We have had countless by ER docs. In my hospital, it's not activated super often though (via EMS), so maybe that's why.
