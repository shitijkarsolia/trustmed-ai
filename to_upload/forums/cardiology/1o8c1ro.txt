===============================================================================

USMD, currently intern at Top 30ish academic university program, which has all the fellowship you can think of. Wants to do EP. Rotated with EP for 2 months during med school and fell in love with the procedures/lifestyle/patient population. I know I’ve a long way to go but wanted some advice on research output needed. Worked my ass off during 4th year of med school and got 6 published papers (5 of them first author) - all of them in EHJ and HR journal. Current have 3 under reviews (2 of them 1st author). Multiple conference attendance (including ACC, AHA, HRS). I understand I need to get into cards first and there are other variables (such as rec letter, step 2 (26x) and all) but wanted your opinion on how much/many research/papers do I need to stay ahead of my peers? Should I keep busting my balls to get the output or should I take it easy during busy residency? What would you say the average papers/research output is for cards fellowship applicants? And does just doing EP research hinders my chances of matching cards? Thanks for all your advice.

I don’t think you need to publish 6 papers a year. You don’t need to do research in every subspecialty field to match into gen cards. Everyone knows you have to go through cardiology to get to EP.

You probably do not need to maintain the same research cadence, but you should find some cardiology research project to stay involved in (even if not leading to more publications). More important: \- Do well as a resident (be reliable, helpful, etc.). \- Do your best to network with the cardiologists at your program.

4. u/ProximalLADLesion [score=3, created=2025-10-16T20:09:45]: I'm an EP fellow at a competitive academic program. I interviewed at most top programs but not Penn. I matched at my first choice. You'll be fine man. Do stuff that interests you.

6. u/cardsguy2018 [score=2, created=2025-10-17T07:53:13]: If you're aiming for a big time academic fellowship program, then keep busting those balls. Otherwise just get involved with *something* so you can talk about it on interview day. You're otherwise in good shape and should match *somewhere* no problem.
