Hey guys I’m currently a 2nd year cardiology fellow and I’m planning to do an EP fellowship. I’m on J1 visa so would need to extend my J1 to 8 years instead of 7 and then do a waiver job. If there are any PDs in the group or APDs or anyone that has any thoughts: how bad is it if I do my waiver job after general fellowship to get my green card (takes 3-4 years) and then come back to do an EP fellowship vs doing it right after general? Looking forward to some input thanks!

2. u/imtocardio [score=14, created=2025-11-02T16:18:28]: Always remember, it's better to do a waiver job in a village as an EP, doing something you always wanted to do in life than being a general cardiologist with a green card and having the anxiety of matching into EP and gonna back to a fellow salary/lifestyle for 2 years. Do it in one stretch. The J1 is as good as it gets for matching into EP (next only to Citizenship/Green Card) and PDs always want fellows fresh out of training (ppl have gone back to training after a few years of attendinghood in cardiology, but it's the exception rather than the rule). EP is also becoming more competitive with each year due to the earning potential and lifestyle (IC had plenty of unfilled spots in last year's match as opposed to EP which had unmatched candidates and filled all spots up front), so do it while you're still able to

4. u/Pure_Distribution_34 [score=6, created=2025-11-02T16:53:03]: I was in a similar position as you, now current 3rd year, I applied for this cycle. I think it’s better to apply right away without any breaks. EP is a whole different language than general cards and it’s hard for people to come back after a long break ( in your case with after 3 year waiver job it will take at least another year before you can get your green card)
