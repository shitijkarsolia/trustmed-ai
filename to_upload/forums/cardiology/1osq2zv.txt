If you want to do a subfellowship you will be able to get whatever big name you want for the majority of sub fellowships. Also you will be surprised on how your career can change when you start fellowship - I started fully committed to advanced imaging MRI/CI but then pivoted to interventional, so I wouldn't worry about that as much. In general: Look at overall procedural volumes for general fellows (if you really want IC make sure gen fellows actually get cath autonomy). I did something like 6-700 diagnostic caths with good autunomy before IC fellowship and it helped tremendously. Don't go to a program where fellows are double logging caths and having to co scrub everything to get their numbers. Look at call schedule and how the years are organized, my gen cards fellowship was very heavily weighted towards first year so third year I got to do a TON of extra cath Sounds dumb but make sure the fellows are happy - don't go to a place where everyone is pissed and you're gonna get dumped on

Interventional patients can be sick, but there's nothing compared to a severe cardiogenic shock patient who gets the gamut of devices and walks out of the hospital post VAD/txp 3 months later.

4. u/FIRE_CHIP [score=4, created=2025-11-09T12:28:08]: Maine medical center would be my number one cause I love Maine but they never sent me an interview when I was applying. Danbury seemed chill but didn't seem too academic.
5. u/Select_Claim7889 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T12:30:35]: Hi! I’m a cardiology NP at Maine Med. Probably can’t tell you much that you’d find super helpful about our fellowship program (though I work closely w the director, who is a good human) but Portland and Maine in general are pretty wonderful.
6. u/3ldude [score=1, created=2025-11-09T12:58:05]: Heard about too many issues at Northeast Georgia Medical Center, don’t rank them high but matching anywhere is better than not matching so do rank them.
7. u/candiyr [score=1, created=2025-11-10T03:39:46]: Sent you a DM
8. u/cardsguy2018 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T08:12:20]: You interviewed there, what did you think?
