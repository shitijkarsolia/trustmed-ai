Hello all! I’m a cardiology fellow who recent became interested in EP after getting exposure with EP lab and I’m trying to see what EP lifestyle and workflow generally looks like. For EPs, I’d love to hear your thoughts/experience on: - What does a typical week look like for you—lab, clinic, consults, call, etc.? - How would you describe the overall lifestyle and work–life balance? - What parts of the field do you dislike? - If you had to do it again, would you choose EP? Appreciate your input! Thanks!

Attending jobs can vary, but often half clinic and half lab during the week (perhaps half day academic day). Lab days are long but fun. Clinic is clinic. Consults - lot of consults as there is something about EP that makes a lot of people nervous. Some of this will depend on hospital culture, eg if you are doing a lot of bread and butter Afib consults or if gen cards fields some of those. Lifestyle is usually good, definitely better than interventional. Some hospitals may have you take a fair amount of general cardiology call - YMMV. Main thing I dislike is ambulatory call (when the Holter people call you that someone has rate controlled Afib at 3am….) - calls like this will depend on your hospital setup though. Wouldn’t do anything else. We have such a cool job - not a lot of things in medicine we can cure, but we can often cure typical flutter and SVT! 😎

But I work really close with our EP team (they’ve been down a PA-C so I help with IP coverage; normally I’m Gen Cards/Interventional team). Context: mid size hospital with a HUGE coverage area on the West Coast so very high volume. Just observations: EP docs obviously don’t have call like IC. But they are machines in terms of all the devices and ablations they do. They still work a lot, 5 days a week. There’s only two of them though. But they get lots random calls about EP pts at odd hours, urgent PPM in the evenings, round on patients late cause they do so after clinic. They do weekend call every two months for rounding on general cards pts. Lastly, they feel their gen cards knowledge gets rusty. TL;DR: way more chill than IC but still a considerable amount of work but that’s probably dependent on your shop/location. But they love what they do! Good luck to you!!
