===============================================================================

I'm debating about this. I study medicine in a European country. I am absolutely certain that i want to do cardiology, i did my dissertation there, worked there for some time besides my studies as well. However, i am still thinking about whether i want to do any research. My plan is/was basically always as follows: Do my fellowships and gain experience here, than go abroad for a couple of years (in a country like Switzerland or Lux that pays more or even the ME), than get back and work in my own doctor's office. Here it's said that you shouldn't go to a academic hospital if you don't want to pursue an accademic career or and become a clinic director. However, i thought that it might be better if i am moving abroad since i bring in better experience, a better renomee for the institution and maybe get paid better. And to be honest, i do like research, it's just that don't see myself in a hospital in 30-40 years. The alternative is to go to a big non-academic institution. The workload is the same, but i don't have to deal with research on top, and i will have broader clinical skills compared to being more specialized in the long run. Not to mention that academic institutions are more competitive for basically anything, it might take longer in the long-run to learn the same skills, albeit a bit on more specialized cases/experience.
