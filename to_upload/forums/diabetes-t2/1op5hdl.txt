Does anyone else find that saying pretty ironic when it comes to type 2 diabetes? Of course I can't eat like I use to, and in all honesty, I shouldn't, because it's what lead me to this point in the first place. I can't eat a whole pizza by myself or gobble down 4 donuts anymore? That's probably for the best as it was essentially untamed gluttony. Drinking straight fruit juice is one step away from drinking sugar water. The taste of sodas have been on the decline for years now. For the most part, 80% of what I should avoid ingesting was terrible to begin with. Not being able to gorge on fruit and avoiding traditionally healthy breads like sourdough kind've sucks but realistically type 2 diabetes just forces you to live a lifestyle that everyone should be doing in the first place: eating whole foods that include primarily vegetables and full proteins while doing enough exercise to build and maintain muscle. Carbs and sugars are entirely unnecessary for a healthy individual to need to consume, they're purely for luxury or if in extreme cases you'd need carbs for fuel doing extended physical labor, which if we're being honest here, a majority of type 2 diabetics aren't in that situation.

And there is a world of difference between eat like I used to and eat all the foods I used to. I can't eat like used to, part due to being T2, but also part because I'm older. As for the foods I used to, sure, some things I now avoid. But if you are well controlled, you can still have a relatively normal diet. I still eat pizza. Do I scarf down a loaded extra large by myself? Heck no. But I'll have a couple of slices. I still eat ice cream, just sugar free. Being able to sustain treatment means not being miserable. It means knowing your limits, but not always cutting our large swaths of foods.

3. u/PhantomPupper [score=30, created=2025-11-05T09:39:34]: Actually, in most cases, diabetes is what causes you to crave to eat like that. Your body isn't working how it's supposed to, so your brain is getting and sending the wrong signals. So, instead of having the typical amount of rice or pizza, you're craving it so badly because your body is thinking it's not getting what it needs. Its resistance to sugars is so messed up that your glucose goes high. I have diabetes because of a family history of diabetes. The food choices I might have made may have contributed to poorer health, but it isn't the cause of it. The cause is that I genetically carried diabetes. So when it took effect, I wasn't able to regulate my thrist and hunger well. I craved more salt, sugar, starches, and carbs and in higher amounts. Maybe I'm off, I'm not a doctor, but this is my understanding of it. I urge anyone reading this to do more research on their own. Not just on diabetes but for any topic as important as this. Because the relationship between average people and food is ruined enough, let alobe with people who have any issues with food, medical or otherwise.

6. u/GreenLetterhead4196 [score=12, created=2025-11-05T08:21:51]: I miss pizza and pad thai so much!!!!!
7. u/Smworld1 [score=9, created=2025-11-05T09:28:59]: If you are well controlled there is no reason you can’t have a slice or two of pizza, or 1 cupcake. What I see a lot of you saying is that it leads to 2,3,4 and then you’re back to old habits. That is more of a sign of disordered eating. If you find you can’t stop then that is a behavior not I like an alcoholic. Once we start with 1, we can’t stop. I’ve been sober for 9.5 yrs and a T2D for 22. If what I said rubs you the wrong way, ask yourself why? Being militant about eating is something that few people can sustain. Eat the cupcake
8. u/ZeniAugusta [score=10, created=2025-11-05T12:49:41]: So sick of this idea that everyone with type 2 diabetes was guzzling sodas and scarfing down entire pies while treating McDonald's fries like a vegetable. I had maybe one soda a year before getting diagnosed. I actually drink more soda now because diet soda is one of the few sweet things readily available to me.
9. u/Hoppie1064 [score=42, created=2025-11-05T08:23:06]: T2 forces you to eat like you should have in the first place. Truer words were never spoken.
10. u/Top_Cow4091 [score=4, created=2025-11-05T08:23:00]: Its hard as i ate like that for like 20 years, i didnt know it was wrecking my body, until i got diagnosed. I jumped the prediabetic phase aswell because i didnt feel anything and when i finally did my a1c was skyhigh
