Hello. Just wondering about the question above.. I was diagnosed prediabetic in May with hba1c of 7 and was prescribed metformin.. my goal was to lose weight and stop metformin and in Sept my hba1c got down to 5.5 also lost about 30 lbs and doctor told me i can stop metformin or i can still take it up to me he said. I decided to stop because that was the goal.. in October I got careless and started eating whatever I wanted.. I am now suffering the consequences of that.. my FBS every morning has been 5.7-6.4 range for a week now (before it was only between 4-5.5). I stopped eating sweets and high carbs recently but I’m scared that I did this again to myself and I really regret it. 😞 Also I’m thinking should I take metformin again? I know I should ask the doctor but he gave me the decision last time (I recently moved to a rural area where there’s only 1 clinic so no other options around) Thank you in advance for any input or advice.

2. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=8, created=2025-11-05T15:49:38]: Yep this happened to me when I was first diagnosed. I dropped my A1C into the 5's and thought I was "cured". Huge mistake and hubris on my part. Diabetes doesn't take a vacation or go away, it is relentless, and when you take your foot off the gas it is waiting for you.
3. u/Zeus783 [score=10, created=2025-11-06T03:48:02]: Whether you're prediabetic or diabetic is just semantics. Your body can't metabolize sugar properly: period! To what degrees the impediment is, should be irrelevant. Being diagnosed as prediabetic with an HbA1c of 7 just because someone passed an OTT test should be a crime. Telling someone to be PRE- diabetic is very misleading unless it's explained in depth what that actually means. Most people assume being PRE means they stop eating pizza once a week and all is dandy 😤 Most doctors are actually very ignorant about T2.! There... Had to vent.. Feel better now. P. S. nothing to do with OP of course.

5. u/thegerl [score=9, created=2025-11-06T02:52:54]: Diabetes doesn't really go into remission. That would mean you could eat anything and stay in non diabetic range. You can manage it with meds and compliance. If one of these goes away, it would be a lot harder to stay in non diabetic ranges. I've been in the 5s regarding A1c for over a year and wouldn't dream of going off meds, food restriction, activity... they're the reason I'm in the 5s.

But only for 4 years or so. It’s back full blown now. So I’m a thin T2 now. I’d say my T2 is worse now than before the RNY.
7. u/Swimming_Director_50 [score=6, created=2025-11-05T15:25:44]: This is one of the reasons I stay on metformin even though my doctor has offered for me to go off. It gives me a little more breathing room to not have to eat keto to stay in control.
8. u/JehovahJesse [score=2, created=2025-11-05T19:33:30]: I went from a 12 A1C upon diagnosis to a 5.4 6 months later. Had a depressive episode due to a life event and just got back on the horse again after 2 years eating what I want with an 11A1C.

10. u/JEngErik [score=1, created=2025-11-05T23:00:16]: 3 years so far, no recurrence
11. u/Dadpod12 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T16:27:43]: 5.7–6.4 is not bad at all! Don’t be too hard on yourself. You can get things under control, and you should be able to do so without medication if that’s really important to you. And if you liked Metformin, there’s no need to feel guilty if you decide to take it again.
