7. u/fyrelilymoon [score=1, created=2025-11-05T23:27:24]: I use the diet detector strips after being given regular root beer instead of my zero sugar one... SO tasty but my glucose was sky high and I felt grossly miserable. Drink water like your life depends on it, take a stroll or whatever movement you enjoy. One steep spike won't throw off all your progress.

9. u/PipeInevitable9383 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T15:54:13]: I've had this happen twice :/ I don't drink much pop, either. You just walk ut off and drink water. Not much else to do about it.
