partner diagnosed with t2 , im trying really hard to get him to eat a healthier diet ,but he really loves caramel and its become a bone of contention between us,he will eat a sharing bar of cadburys caramel , and i really dont want to keep on at him about how catastrophically bad that is,so i want to try and make a sugar free caramel so he can see that he can still have something he likes

There are also a couple Atkins brand chocolate caramel bars that I like even more (we usually buy them online but I’ve seen them at the store as well). I will just note that it’s good to start slow with sugar free candies because they give some people diarrhea (especially if you eat a lot).

You can use allulose or erythritol. https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/s/YFpMNFW2y7

Here’s the link for caramel sauce:[https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/the-best-low-carb-caramel-sauce/](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/the-best-low-carb-caramel-sauce/) or [https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/sugar-free-keto-caramel-sauce/](https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/sugar-free-keto-caramel-sauce/)
5. u/Educational-Guard408 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T17:51:57]: Blue Bunny soft ice cream with sugar free chocolate syrup from Hershey. Add chopped walnuts and whipped cream for a nice low carb dessert
6. u/FL_Is_Hot [score=1, created=2025-11-07T10:49:34]: Sanders has sugar-free. Barebells Carmel protein bars are just like a candy bar with no sugar and manageable carbs.
