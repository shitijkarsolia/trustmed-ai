Hi all - my father (age 72) recently stopped taking the medication Januvia for his type 2 diabetes after having a reaction to the medication. Long story short, he was on Januvia for 6 years - suddenly had some all over body itching as a result of low kidney function due to the medication. His doctor took him off the Januvia suddenly. Just like that, after 6 years, stopped taking it. Hasn’t replaced the medication with anything else. This was about 4 weeks ago. Since then he’s been suffering from blurry vision, light headedness, low appetite, feeling “off balance”, and just not himself. He went to the ER last week.. they did a CT, blood work, etc.. all the things that came back normal. We say one of his PCP’s partners today and she thought he might have positional vertigo. We were able to do a same day with a physical therapist who after doing a few maneuvers said it is not vertigo. His blood sugars are testing back in range. They fluctuate but nothing out of what is considered ordinary. Has anyone else stopped Januvia suddenly and have had similar experiences with symptoms? What did you do? When did it subside? We are starting to wonder if his body just needs some time to regulate and get back to normal. We’ve done all the things and have found out a lot about what isn’t wrong with him… but it’s easy to see he’s frustrated and anxious. He’s an incredibly healthy person - eats well, goes to the YMCA 2-3 times a week to lift weights and walk, and does all the things to be healthy. He’s been staying home, not going much of anywhere, etc… and I just want to help him. Let me know if anyone else has a similar story! Thank you! 😊
