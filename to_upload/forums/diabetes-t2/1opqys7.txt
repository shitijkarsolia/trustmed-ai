my OH has been on metformin since may or june , but apart from the blood test he had that led to the diagnoses of t2 he's not had any since , is this normal coz i've seen lots of posts about ppl knowing what their a1c is ( i dont even know what that is) and their blood glucose levels ,and we know none of this it seems like they gave him the diagnoses ,the metformin and thats it no information beyond switch to sweetner and change your diet, do i need to buy him a glucose monitor thing ,or do the nhs provide them i just don't know

Lots of helpful people on there with experience of how diabetes care works on the NHS: https://www.diabetes.org.uk/support-for-you/community-support-and-forums/online-support-forum I'm not certain my situation applies to you as I'm in Ireland, but here fasting blood glucose is not typically tested by the doctor, just HbA1c. It's the test used at diagnosis but you may need to ask the doctor or use the NHS app to see blood test results. Here the test is done every six months or three months following changes in medication, though I think in the UK the policy varies depending on where exactly you live.

If he was put on medication at day 1 they should have asked for him to come back in 3 months for another blood test and to review the medication. Do you know what his initial results were? I refused medication and chose to reverse it with diet and exercise.
