Weight loss with prediabetes Has anyone else experienced weight loss with prediabetes? 5 years ago I was 170lbs, now I’m 154. I’ve cut out a lot of junk food in that time but I seem to have lost a lot of muscle and I hardly have much body fat anymore. Everytime I try and lift weight or get into an exercise routine my body just can’t handle it and I almost feel weaker/cold like symptoms in the days after. I’ve tried to eat more to put in weight but it’s just not working and people I know keep making comments about my weight loss although it’s not something I can help. I’m having some blood test done this week just to see where I’m at, I feel like the numbers have probably gone up since the last time. Anybody have experience with gaining weight in a similar situation?

Your doctor should run screening for T-1 diabetes if the weight loss was sudden and not traceable to changes in your diet. There are several subtypes of diabetes and your issues may not even be related to diabetes. Hopefully all is well but your doctor visit should help identify what is going on. Good luck!

I used to have a big ol hockey/soccer butt now I have a Hank Hill butt
