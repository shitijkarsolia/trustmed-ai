===============================================================================

I always knew maintaining would be a challenge. Lost 40 pounds, and A1C down to non-diabetic… but wife commented the love-handles starting to show again… and the new 32 waist is feeling a little snug. And the why is obvious to me! but seemingly beyond my ability to reign it in. So I’m just starting a new strategy…, either a 4/3 (for a week) or a 2/1 for easier keeping track. The plan is to ensure 4 successful control days (staying within calorie budget, no bad carb excesses, and a measure of exercise…, such that I end the day feeling good about my state of being…), and then allow up to 3 days of mild excesses (not going crazy just indulging a little.., and possibly missing the exercise…). I know it’s the self-discipline that is needed…, but I have lot of ways to rationalize a little excess. Any thoughts? Or suggestions on other strategies to maintain?

Most people allow 1 or 2 cheat days a week but you are advocating for double that. Adding in 60 minutes of exercise a few times a week can help you relax the diet a bit since your BS will be good a day or two after that. In the long run the more tight your diet the better your waistline and numbers will be.

Imagine if an alcoholic was trying to control their addiction and said: "The plan is to ensure 4 successful control days (only Coors Light and White Claws), and then allow up to 3 days of mild excesses (whisky and rum)."

She says all the time “this isn’t a diet, it’s the rest of your life.” I think that shift in attitude was really helpful, and a reset for me. Every single day is part of this new life, not on track or a deviation from it, just another day. This is how I live now.

For me, it’s eating well enough to keep the cravings (bad) and puffiness/ inflammation (very bad) away. The trick for me isn’t so much about absolute perfection, but more about staying within the bounds of what keeps me feeling good. Then I’m steady or making progress.
6. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=2, created=2025-11-07T05:09:12]: I'm curious what specifically you find difficult about maintaining. For me it has been pretty much the same since I adopted my revised lifestyle as my "new normal" that should have been how I always lived: intentionally, mindfully, and (now) better aware of what supports my nutrition and health. Exercise is simply activity. Sometimes structured, sometimes not. Diet is simply what I choose to eat, mindful of the effects it has on my health. For me, "maintenance" is just another way of saying "life.,,"
