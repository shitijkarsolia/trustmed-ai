And how sick do you have to be to notice it is elevated? Do you do anything differently? Navigating my first illness since being diagnosed.

When I'm really sick it's more like a 40 to 50 mg/dL rise.

Even a sore throat can cause small bumps. Just check a bit more often, stay hydrated, and keep carbs steady so you don’t chase highs and lows. You’re doing the right thing by paying attention early on.
3. u/Lucky-Conclusion-414 [score=3, created=2025-11-07T07:41:39]: it's different every time. Sometimes I'm sick as a dog and the blood sugar is just fine. Sometimes I'm up 40 points and just have a stuffy nose. Diet and exercise are screwed up - so those are big factors too. So I think its hard to say a lot more than "sometimes when you're sick you'll have elevated sugars". Once, when I had a fever with covid my CGM was just as good as a thermometer - going up and down with my fever. That was kind of amusing. But I've had other fevers that didn't make a dent on the sugar. who knows, really. I also wanted to say that if your elevated numbers are not insane (like 225+ would be insane) then it's just not something you need to stress over. A couple days of 150 on a one-off event isn't going to impact your health in the big picture... I've seen people posting to figure out how to go for a walk with a 102 degree temperature and nausea. Just rest :)

5. u/PipeInevitable9383 [score=1, created=2025-11-08T18:36:10]: I hover between 120-140 .
