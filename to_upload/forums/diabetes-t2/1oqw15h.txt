===============================================================================

So I am 45 and been type 2 for about 20 years. Was poorly controlled in the early days but always had clear eye screening. About 10 years I got 'some background detected' that went away next year. This year I got a letter saying Stage 1 detected. The thing that confuses me is the past few years my HBA1C's have been excellent. 4.2, 4.7 etc so bit surprised to see it had progressed. I started on Mourjano 4 weeks ago as decided I need to lose a good 3 stone (was 18 stone and have lost 10 pounds so far) but I have been 'obese' since I was 11 so I guess this has been 'coming' persay even with the good HBA1C's? Not sure if Stage 1 is reversible. The letter says not to worry and to manage blood sugar (thought I was!) and next appointment isn't for a year! Just interested in any advise anyone has or experience as a bit down

My doctor and endocrinologist told me that damage is usually already done by the time someone has been officially diagnosed and that damage will progress over the years. New damage is not usually something that happens once you're controlled. I don't know anything or have any experience with the stages etc. maybe someone else can share some experience.
