===============================================================================

I had some blood work done last week. The results suggest my glucose is within range (5.1 mmol/), however, my insulin levels are extremely high (14.6 mIU/L). I would like to take all steps to avoid entering pre-diabetes terrain (evidently I am developing insulin resistance). In the past week, I've improved my diet, reducing sugar and carbs. I too have started exercising daily. My question: my doctor has advised taking Glucophage (Metformin). While I'm aware Glucophage helps in making Insulin more sensitive, I'm wondering 1) whether it will cause dependency (wherein my body's beta cells will stop producing insulin in a healthy manner)? and 2) whether Glucophage really will help address my insulin resistance? I really want to avoid this insulin resistance progressing into prediabetes. Your assistance and suggestions would go a long way! Thanks!

It doesn't have anything to do with insulin production. I think combination with diet and exercise (building muscle specifically will help) while decreasing the strain on your pancreas will help.
