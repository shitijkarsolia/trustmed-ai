3. u/pureimaginatrix [score=4, created=2025-11-07T12:22:46]: It's your hormones, like cortisol, kicking in to get you ready to wake up. As long as your A1C is good, I wouldn't worry about it.

6. u/StatisticianSafe3807 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T11:53:03]: It increases from 150 to 175 each morning
7. u/Ok_Performance3004 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T11:59:40]: Dawn phenomenon. Curious, what was your last A1C?
8. u/Traditional_Living_5 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T12:15:43]: I found fixing my sleep schedule greatly reduced the morning spike. I try to get outside early to see the sunrise and limit light exposure and screen time after dark. My morning glucose numbers have dropped 10 points doing this.
