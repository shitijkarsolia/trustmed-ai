===============================================================================

I was just reading another post here and the OP related some issues they had with CVS and Walmart. One in particular, was a 2 day delay in getting a prescription switched from one to the another. As one didn't have what they needed. Reminded me of an experience I had. I spent most my life living in Southern California. Lived in Manhattan for some years. Always hated pharmacies. Big chains rule in places like that. Since moving to a very small town in Ohio. You notice little differences that end up becoming HUGE differences. There is a CVS on the corner right across the street from a locally owned pharmacy. Couldnt be in more direct competition with each other if they tried. After my ICU stay for DKA. I had my prescriptions sent to the local pharmacy. Got there, tried to use my HSA card and it wouldn't work on their machine. Walked across the street switched the prescription and card still didn't work. Ugh. I start making phone calls. Next thing, im getting a call from the local pharmacy. Instead of letting me just go. They had been in the phone trying figure out from their end what might have been wrong. They actually told me what to do to fix the issue. Of course I went back to them. For about 6 months despite every prescription I have written to the local place. Somehow CVS still got it first and I have to have to switched. Even after going into CVS twice to tell them to never fill my prescriptions. I dont even know how they call it "FILLED" if I never picked it up. This pharmacist goes above and beyond for me every time I walk in the door. They literally have two 10 ft rows of product to sell. Not one soda or bag of chips. No candy. Although they do sell locally harvested raw honey. Just prescription drugs and useful medical products. If you need something from one of those shelves. They walk out and grab it for you, if you missed it. If they dont carry it and you actually use it a lot. They'll carry it for you. Long-winded way to say. Give the small guy a shot. They just might knock your socks off. They dont let me have issues with my meds. They take that on, or at least give me good advise on how to get it down. We all know how important meds can be to us and the little guy took away my huge worries.

The service was so superior that I get everything there now. They don't have online access but I'm cool with using their phone in service. The people actually care.

I'd started using walmart during the pandemic because they had a drive up window but lately they have been making mistakes, don't have common prescriptions in stock, and when it takes them 5+ weeks to fill my test strips script, it really means I am having to make a 5 month supply last 6 months. My doctor said she has heard MANY complaints from her patients about WM lately!

But switched Drs when a regional health office opened in the town and they have an in house pharmacy (in the same office where I go see my endo), absolute cheapest insulin I’ve ever purchased and I get prescribed both long and short acting. And since the pharmacy is associated with the Dr so easy to get refills or whatever help needed. And I do find them much more friendly and personable, the pharmacist knows my name, says hi when I walk past the window just to go to my appointments. Really lucked out in this situation.
4. u/CursiveWhisper [score=1, created=2025-11-07T13:23:55]: I am not allowed to give the little guy a shot. My insurance requires me to go to Walgreens or I don’t get a discount and might not get any coverage for my prescriptions. I’m also required to get 90 days of medicine at a time which kills my wallet. Also these large pharmacies no long keep most meds in stock and order from warehouse when the request comes in. I’ve had to have more partial prescriptions filled which is a waste of time having to return in a few days. Other times I’ve had to wait 5 days to get a prescription filled where 3 years ago, it was never longer than 2 days if there was any wait at all. The U.S. insurance and medical industries are broken and only enhance the large companies.
