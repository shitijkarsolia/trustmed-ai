===============================================================================

Hello so last week I (27F) was diagnosed with type two last Wednesday. This was a blow and I think this was the reason I cannot get pregnant. I am on a low carb/ low sugar diet. I also get about 45mins everyday of walking. I’m fine with it and it’s proven effective before in weight loss. I guess my question is my A1C was at an 11 and this was only one test. I want to know in three months how did y’all do with your A1C? I’m also nervous for thanks giving if it will not help with next check up. Sorry I’m distraught right now and need positive feedback.

Any good doctor will tell you that this is a marathon, not a sprint and that the first step is to be kind to yourself. Now, what I will say is that there are many different paths tot wake in this journey. Some people find that medication is best, some people find that eating better and exercising is best and some people find that a combination of all of that is best. Results vary for everyone. I can speak from my own personal experience. Personally, I took the combination route and lowered my A1C from 10.7 in March to 8 in June and then 6.3 in September. Some people have experienced more significant drops, some people struggle more than others. There are a lot of factors that play into it.

This little piece of equipment is a game changer and gives you a window into what is happening when you eat something or exercise. Before I got one I was winging it and hoping for the best evert 3 months. Sometimes I was successful and sometimes I wasn't. The hard thing was I had no idea how I was doing until that test. Now I can estimate how my A1C is trending over weeks and months, not just 3 months.Trust me if you get one you won't regret it!

Chances are if you get your diet, activity level, stress management, and medication down your numbers will be lower and stay in range for good. Game your numbers and they may come down... For a little while. Then what?

While lowering it is important, please make changes that are sustainable. Otherwise, it is very easy to go off track and raise a1c again after the strict regime of the first 3 months. 45 min walk is good, but if you can do intermittent fasting and walk 25-30 mins after each meal, that's better. Invest in a CGM like Dexcom or Freestyle libre to get real-time insights into how your blood sugar is affected by food, sleep, stress levels, and exercise. Also, there is no shame in getting the help that you need. Hope you are getting medication needed. Mostly, Metformin extended release is prescribed, and it helps a lot! Good luck, you got this!

Don't know whether I can continue, but it is awsome atm. Feel 20 years younger. Weight down. Strength up. Sleeping problems gone. Depression gone. For me, it seems, my diagnosis was the best thing that could happen to me.
7. u/Carliv79 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T07:16:15]: Jardiance and glipizide. Can’t tolerate metformin unfortunately. Cgm helped a lot. 12.8 to 5.8 in about 4 months
