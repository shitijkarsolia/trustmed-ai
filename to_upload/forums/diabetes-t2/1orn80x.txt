===============================================================================

I was able to drop my HA1C from 10.2 to 5.7 since I received my diagnosis 3 months ago, by changing my diet and adding some exercise. (No meds.) I'm down 40 lbs, and I feel great aside from getting lightheaded sometimes when I stand up, and my hands tingling if I lay on an arm or too long. I went for my blood draw yesterday around noon and hadn't eaten since 6pm the evening before (needed to be fasted.) I did a finger prick right before I walked in and it showed 91. Which is a new low for me, I've been hovering around 100. But the glucose level that came back from my bloodwork ended up being 69, so that's a frustrating difference, and also annoying because I've spent the past 3 months working to lower my fasting glucose, and now it reads too low? Some of my other numbers are high now. In those 3 months my LDL went from 109 to 148 (normal range is 0-130.) My diet pretty much consists of eggs, chicken, turkey, pork, salads, and lots of cheese and nuts. I'll also have a slice of ezekiel with avocado or peanut butter (just peanuts) a few times a week, and an occasional whey protein shake with unsweetened almond milk. So I'm thinking it might be the excessive cheese and nuts, maybe along with the pork? I'd really love any thoughts about this as I try to map out what my diet looks like for the next 3 months to lower my LDL. (If it helps, total cholesterol is 191 with a normal range being &lt;=200. Triglycerides are 56 and HDL is 32, both within normal ranges.) The other one that is high is Anion Gap at 17.2 (normal range 6-15.) I looked into this one and it seems it could be high because my body was fasted and I'm ketosis, which I think is actually a good thing... should I worry about this one? Edit to add: I've also been eating a lot of beef sticks/turkey sticks. I don't want to leave that out as it may be contributing to my high LDL.

That was the old misguided science of the late 20th century into the first decade. It may take some time for you numbers to stabilize. I've had an hbA1c under 5 for 3 years and it took nearly 3 years for my cholesterol numbers to get to where I want. I fast every day with extended fasts every week. As for the fasting glucose, mine trends even lower than that (as low as 57 but typically 65-75). For me, it's quite safe and feels great to me. Your feelings of malaise may be caused by the rapid improvement in health. I experienced something similar having taken my hbA1c from 10.6 to 4.8 in 3 months. It went away with time. Congratulations on your success!
2. u/SpyderMonkey_ [score=9, created=2025-11-08T05:13:20]: I have a similar problem. Triglycerides and cholesterol is high when my a1c is low due to a more ketogenic diet. I have found consuming mlre fish helps instead of pork/beef.
3. u/BrettStah [score=7, created=2025-11-08T05:22:15]: When I was losing weight, I also had a temporary increase in cholesterol. My understanding is that cholesterol is fat, and when someone starts losing stored body fat, it can raise their blood cholesterol. Once I got through the majority of my fat loss that issue cleared up. Interestingly, losing the fat can also temporarily cause free testosterone levels to drop for awhile - that also happened to me, and it went away too.

6. u/Academic_Carpet9452 [score=1, created=2025-11-08T06:38:27]: Congratulations. ..well done! I read your diet. I'm curious have you had any test meal with higher carbs and what kind of numbers did you see after eating? Not advocating that you do just curious if you had. Some similarities in our story..Now that you mentioned it, the light headed when standing I had that also and it went away.
7. u/bluedelvian [score=1, created=2025-11-08T08:26:05]: "Too low" glucose is defined by symptoms, not numbers. Long-time keto dieters often have very low glucose, it's an indication of metabolic flexibility as long as you feel fine.
8. u/messhotx [score=1, created=2025-11-09T07:35:41]: I have high cholesterol and I try to avoid eating eggs, pork and cheese as much as I can .
9. u/Jmj2121 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T13:52:35]: You’re fine, when fat cells deplete they do in fact raise cholesterol levels temporarily. You’re fine, don’t change anything. And sugar is only too low if you feel low blood sugar symptoms, you’re fine. Trust me. My sister thrives and her sugar is in the 50s quite regularly
