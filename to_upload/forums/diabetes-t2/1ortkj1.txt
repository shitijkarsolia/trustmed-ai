Edit: I probably should have googled to start with but according to the SURPASS clinical trial A1C reduction is dependent on dosing. At my last appointment (new doctor, the one that prescribed to me left the practice) I asked about going up in dose (5mg) as my diet is currently very limited for keeping good blood sugar control. I said I would like to be able to eat a greater variety of foods outside of basically just chicken and green veggies. I was told that the medicine doesn’t work that way and increasing dose wouldn’t work. And then told not to lose any more weight (yeah, it would help if I could eat more foods 🙄). What has your experience been and if you know of any research you could point me towards I would appreciate it.

2. u/azwildlotus [score=8, created=2025-11-08T10:44:46]: Monjaro helps glucose control independent of the weight loss. I took this to mean the OP is wanting help with controlling their glucose so they can expand their diet without having to be so restrictive since restriction is how they are currently maintaining control. The control has been a life changer to me. The weight loss is secondary. Isn’t that what the medication was originally prescribed for?

4. u/Gritts911 [score=8, created=2025-11-08T09:47:58]: If they don’t want you to lose any more weight then I assume you are at your ideal weight? I’m on Mounjaro and my understanding is that it slows down your entire digestive system, slows sugar release, and produces more insulin. I’ve been able to eat basically anything I want since it slows down the absorption and makes me eat a lot less. But I consider “good” blood sugar control to be anything under 140 at this point. If I eat better I see it go down closer to 100mg/dl. If you are on 2.5 that’s probably a maintenance dose. They won’t want to increase it if that would cause you to lose more weight. What do you consider good control? And how do your numbers change with a “bad” diet? Maybe you are sliding more into t1 territory with reduced insulin production or something. I would definitely keep an eye on it.
5. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=3, created=2025-11-08T09:48:00]: Have you tried other medications to help you out? Many of us are poly pharmacy and take a number of meds in addition to Mounjaro to help with our BS. Another medication to help you out would probably work better than a higher dose of Mounjaro. Talk with your PCP for more information.
6. u/meowbeepboop [score=3, created=2025-11-08T12:02:03]: Is your dose 2.5mg or 5mg? I’m not sure from what you said in your post. But anyway, the dosing guidelines for Mounjaro specifically say that 2.5 is considered an introductory dose for acclimation to the drug, and is not intended for glycemic control for a diabetic. The dosing guidelines also say that you can increase your dose past 5mg as needed for additional blood sugar control. This can all be found on their website: https://mounjaro.lilly.com/hcp/getting-patients-started It might be worth it to get a second opinion. Also if you’re not already working with an endocrinologist, see if you can get a referral to an endocrinologist who specializes in treating diabetes. They’ll be a lot more equipped to help you treat your diabetes.
7. u/CursiveWhisper [score=2, created=2025-11-08T11:08:05]: Have you had your A1C done since starting? If so, have your blood sugars improved? I’m on a steady 5mg dose of Mounjaro and my blood sugars have dropped (from 8.5 before to 6.2 after starting the shots) , along with weight. Do you find yourself still eating normally on the 5mg dose and that’s why your diet is restricted? If so, you probably need to go up to the next level because your body has gotten used to it. The idea is to keep increasing doses each month until your body adjusts. Personally the 5mg is good for me to stay on because I’m not super hungry so there no need to restrict what I’m eating to help with my blood sugars. I also was not a big eater before going on it. Another note, if you’ve lost too much weight and you’re not eating anything but chicken because you’re not hungry for anything else, that’s a good reason not to go up in dose.
