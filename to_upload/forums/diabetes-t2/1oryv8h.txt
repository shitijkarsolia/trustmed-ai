===============================================================================

I was recently diagnosed with T2D, and I have had tingling/burning feelings in my lower legs for over a year, I just thought it was how I was sitting, cutting off circulation and whatnot. This morning, I woke up and my left arm is randomly tingling, has anyone had these issues? My blood is in check, this morning it was 87, and 2 hours after breakfast, it was 119. Just looking for any help.

I would think that as you improve control of levels the symptoms would diminish. Mine did. Still have tingling, but much better then when i first found out. The numbers you posted are excellent, but a few numbers doesnt tell a tale enough to say anything really. If I was you and had the concern. I'd make an appt ASAP to find out one way or another.

I’ve experienced similar feelings in my legs before, and it can sometimes be early neuropathy, even when your blood sugar seems well-controlled. The new tingling in your arm is definitely worth getting checked by your doctor, just to rule out other causes. I use NJAP patches with my sensors, and while they help me monitor quietly, I still pay attention to any new sensations like that. You’re not alone, and it’s good you’re keeping an eye on your numbers.

I was diagnosed with diabetes BECAUSE of these exact symptoms which indicates that I was in fact diabetic for many years NOT that the symptoms could not be a result of diabetes because I hadn’t been diabetic long enough… Pregablin (can’t remember the spelling) was what helped me get past sleepless neuropathy pain. After a few months I was able to stop taking it and I’ve been fine without it ever since (5 years).

6. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=1, created=2025-11-08T14:03:48]: The same happens to me if I sleep weird. If its persistent bring it up to your doctor as it could be the start or neuropathy.
7. u/fire_thorn [score=1, created=2025-11-09T09:34:47]: I had tingling and burning in my feet for several years before I was diagnosed with diabetes. It would especially happen during exercise. I mentioned it to the doctor who diagnosed my diabetes and she prescribed gabapentin, and that stopped the tingling and burning. Recently I've started waking up with my thumb and two fingers numb on my right hand. I think it's carpal tunnel syndrome. It stops when I get up, so I haven't been worried about it enough to mention it to a doctor yet. If you ever have numbness/weakness on one side of the body that starts suddenly, that can be a stroke symptom. That's what my stroke felt like. My left arm and leg were suddenly numb.

9. u/slothole [score=1, created=2025-11-09T21:53:16]: my left big toe tingled. i figured it was neuropathy. i was a heavy alcoholic in my 20s as well. it’s better since i quit drinking and focusing on my pre-diabetes.
