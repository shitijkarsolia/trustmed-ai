Hey everyone, I’m trying to quit smoking and was thinking of using vaping temporarily — not as a long-term thing, just to get off cigarettes. Since I’m diabetic, I wanted to check if anyone has noticed any changes in their blood sugar levels while vaping — any spikes, drops, or other weird effects? If you’ve tried vaping just to quit smoking, how did it go? And did it mess with your glucose control in any way? Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through this.

2. u/Old_Performer_6155 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T16:55:11]: I have vaped for years, and in the last year once something significant enough happened for me to make changes, I brought my a1c from 12.9 to 6.3 in 11 months with insulin and drastic diet changes, vaping the entire time. It has zero effect on my blood sugar.

4. u/Smworld1 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T15:55:07]: Neither smoking and now vaping has ever affected my blood sugar
5. u/Sad-Committee-1870 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T15:46:55]: FYI, vaping is more addicting than smoking and harder to quit.
6. u/No_Reflection3133 [score=1, created=2025-11-08T17:21:01]: Go see a hypnotherapist. I got off 30 years of cigarettes in one visit. A week not smoking paid for it.

8. u/WaltonGogginsTeeth [score=1, created=2025-11-09T05:09:20]: No effect, I keep very tight control of mine closed to 100 or less. Vaping doesn’t change it.
9. u/Highway_Gains [score=0, created=2025-11-08T14:49:15]: I tried smoking just for fun and i noticed spikes even though i vape only once a week and it stays whole week in the body then i asked chatgpt also n it was came out as vape have more effect than alcohol.
