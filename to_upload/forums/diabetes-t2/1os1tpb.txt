Has anybody found that foods have a different impact on BS at different times of the day? It seems like I can eat anything (like even the non diabetes-friendly foods—in moderation, of course) in the morning. My BS doesn’t really move. But the same foods in the afternoon make things go crazy. I’m on 2,000mg Metformin usually taken right before bed

My Blood sugars are lowest naturally around 5pm so afternoon is when I would tolerate more carbs, but it makes sense as that's when my body is working the hardest. In fact I mostly only eat one meal per day during the week around 11am and that allows me to keep my blood sugar under much better control all around. I also take 2000mg split 1000 morning and night.

But that same meal stays in range after 2p or 3p, even when I was only 2Kmg Metformin only. I've always guessed that it's because the 3MF I take with first meal have settled in and fat/fiber/protein is buffering subsequent meals. But I dunno now, I came across some stuff regarding metabolism being tied to one's circadian rhythm. I'm not quite there in understanding that yet though (or if it's valid).
