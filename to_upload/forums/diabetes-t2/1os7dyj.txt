===============================================================================

Hello, I just recently got diagnosed with T2 Diabetes and honestly it’s caught me by surprise and not at the same time. Now with this new diagnosis I am struggling a bit to adjust, i am doing my part with exercise &amp; I know to eat more greens and not the starchy ones I believe, stay away from bread and carbs, no sugary anything and if I’m on the go I’m trying to find fast food places and meals from them that won’t hurt me too much if eaten and I just want to ask how did you deal with some of these issues when first diagnosed? Do you have any advice? I honestly miss sodas more than anything and was wondering if sugar free options were okay? Are sugar free options for desserts okay also? Can I still eat cheese? Is crystal light okay for replacing sodas? I’m just a bit overwhelmed by this new news and still am trying to figure out a plan and how to deal with all of this. Anything helps, thank you.

Where I live in was able to attend digital and in person classes as well as booking in time with a nutritionist. Also acquiring a prescription for CGMs will help huge. This thing was my worst enemy at first but it's a huge help now. Do lots of research on how they work too since they dont always explain the ins and outs of them. When it comes to fast food I try to cut back but if course thats not always an option. What I do now is find the most protein and fats and lowest amount of carbs. If I go to McDonald's I grab 2 double cheese burgers, remove ketchup, add mayo (removes sugar from ketchup) and then remove 1 bun from each, combine them to make a quad cheese burger. Alternatively if there's a quick chicken wing joint I'll get wings and veggies and my numbers barely move. I have sugar free sodas once in a while and they dont affect me. I try and stick to water and maybe a coffee without sugar. Anything sugar free doesnt hit me at all including the rare sugar free energy drink. Green and black tea is decent too i just add 0 sugar creamer and sweetener. You're already doing the right thing by asking questions so good job there. Its a long road but it's about progress not perfection. You're gonna slip, have good days and bad, but they all pass just do your best the next day. I've been through the new diagnosis shock, depression, fear of food but I learned what affects me and how and almost 8 months in im under control and calm. You'll get there like the rest of us

I did find that exercise helped keep my numbers stable. I found kick boxing helped with the stress and I lost a little weight which also helped with the numbers. No. I don’t recommend you take up kick boxing. Find a physical activity you enjoy and do it regularly. I changed where I go for takeout. I go to places that can customize my order. For example Chinese and Mexican restaurants, I can ask to omit an ingredient and ask for more vegetables. You can sometimes ask for your food to be prepared a certain way. Some places can make the change.

Do you have a **glucometer** to test various foods to see which ones and how much throw you above range? If you overshoot, a walk or steps in place help bring spikes down quicker, if too high or too prolonged. Unsweetened drinks (soda, Gatorade crystal light), string cheese, cheddar, and a slice of American don't affect my glucose. With cheese, especially, other's may process it differently. There are "Keto" breads and Ice Cream, low carb ice cream &amp; sugar-free candies. Just a heads up that some candies are made with sugar alcohols, if you're sensitive. I'll be honest, fast food is hard. I do well with Taco Bell's Cantina bowls and maybe 5 tortilla chips. Some folks don't eat the buns on their burgers. Or maybe you could see if half the bun might still work. Maybe look up sequenced eating- basically fiber-protein first to buffer carbs. If you overshoot, a walk or steps in place help bring spikes down quicker, if too high or too prolonged.

Sugar, simple carbs (starches) or highly processed carbs (white bread, crackers, rice) increase blood glucose. The ADA says that a high fiber/high carb diet is better for diabetes than a low carb/low fiber diet. The details make a difference! Greens should be fine unless you add sugar. Too much saturated fat will increase insulin resistance, but other fats as well as protein should reduce insulin response.
