===============================================================================

Has anyone here successfully stopped taking a high dose of insulin and managed to keep their blood sugar in a healthy range? I’m currently on about 60 units and I’m curious if it’s possible to taper off safely. I’d love to hear what steps you took, how long it took, and anything you learned along the way. Real experiences would be really helpful.

I weighed 225 pounds at the time. By a combination of diet changes, basic keto with daily built-in treats to keep me from being tempted to cheat; medication changes and way more exercise, I am now using 25 units of basal daily and 3-5 units of novolog at meals. I, now weigh between 175 and 180 pounds. There is hope; but please take it easy and follow your provider 's advise. It took me the better part of 10 years to get here.

But if you are a new diabetic with a high A1c, the doctors usually put you on insulin to lower and then you either get off insulin completely and take other meds or you continue with lower insulin + other medication.
4. u/mckulty [score=5, created=2025-11-09T13:02:53]: 60 units of Lantus isn't really "high dose." I take 140 of lantus and ~120 of Novolog every day. Ain't no coming back from that.
5. u/painter8 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T14:35:28]: I was on 40 units nightly Lantus (original A1C was 13.8) and when I went to 7.5 MJ a month ago, I had 48 hours of continuous hypo lows, so I stopped insulin myself after the first night (a Saturday) and followed up with my doctor the following Monday. Probably not recommended, but it’s just the way it happened for me. I’m newly diagnosed as of last August and have been very low carb and disciplined to stay ‘in range’ 100% of the time on my CGM, so I think that contributed. I take a fiber supplement in everything I drink and Collagen 3x a day to keep my protein up. But Mounjaro has been very effective for me, so much so that it surprised my doctor. Over the two weeks, my numbers have started to climb a bit so my doctor increased my MJ to 10 last week. I haven’t been able to exercise due to a broken toe/foot, but plan to do so when I get clearance because I know that will help. The CGM is the #1 thing to help guide me because I made corrections every time I saw something impacted me negatively. It’s possible but the path you take depends on your circumstances and you should talk to your Endo about the best way forward.

7. u/therealdeal1966 [score=3, created=2025-11-09T15:56:55]: I have done strict keto twice and gotten off Insulin all together within two to three weeks but also felt it was not a substantiable lifestyle. Now I maintain a low carb type diet and allow cheat days on the weekends. At one time I was using 70 units long acting and close to 20 fast acting per meal. Now I use only fast acting (when needed) based on the meal. I have been diabetic for 30 years, studied diet and exercise, tried almost every medication, sold pharmaceuticals to physicians etc. and changed my body type many times over the years as I was obese in my younger ones, so I have allot of experience. In my 50 (now 59) I am in the best shape of my life.
8. u/FeFiFoPlum [score=5, created=2025-11-09T11:32:33]: Another “GLP-1 got me off insulin” case here, although in my case it was Byetta (then Victoza, then Bydureon, then Trulicity, then Ozempic, and now Mounjaro) because I’ve been on one for most of the last 13 or so years. Shit… did the math. Nearly 18 years.
9. u/Dgskydive [score=2, created=2025-11-09T12:21:44]: I was on 30 units of Lantus a day. Plus 10 units of lispro before each meal. I was able to work off them.
10. u/deuceice [score=2, created=2025-11-09T15:16:47]: Review the effects of Intermittent Fasting. When I couple fasting 16:8 Su -F with a 72 hr fast every two weeks, I came off of insulin entirely. My last high a1c was 14, but my insulin dose were closer to 30 units daily.
