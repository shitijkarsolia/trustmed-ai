===============================================================================

I wanted to post about some moderate success I’ve had recently in regards to treating both type 2 diabetes and perimenopause. I have been at a weight loss stall, as well as a a1c stall. I will still petition my dr to prescribe a glp-1 to help me lose some weight so I’m no longer in the obese category. I was tested for sleep apnea. My A1c hasn’t been “high enough” nor any other health issues bad enough for my insurance to allow the script to be approved. Kaiser Permanente, btw. I have a hate/like preference to this. Like the lower costs, hate the many, many hoops. I have also been treating my very low hormone levels treated with prescription meds - for Estrogen, Progesterone AND testosterone. As I’ve gotten those balanced better, my daily glucose readings have gotten better, and recent A1C dropped from 7.4 to 6.9. No change in diet or exercise or diabetic medication levels. I’ve also lost and kept off about 5-7 pounds. (Instead of gaining and losing those repeatedly). I’m also sleeping better, not dealing with carb cravings and have most of my mental clarity back. Hormone levels drop can cause issues for every gender. If you are struggling with symptoms related to an imbalance with hormones, please pursue it and get it checked. It might be the key to gaining success in treating t2d.
