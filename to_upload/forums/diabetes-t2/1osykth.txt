===============================================================================

Took a trip to a neighboring city this weekend and decided to do a walking tour. By the end of the day, my tracker showed **36,834 steps!** My daily goal is 8,000, so that number kind of blew my mind. What made it even more satisfying was that it rained for half the day, but I just kept going. A year ago, when I was first diagnosed with Type 2, I would barely walk 200 steps in a day. Some days even that felt like too much. Back then, I dreaded walking to the mailbox and couldn't imagine walking more than around the supermarket, and only then using a shopping cart as my walker. This trip reminded me that while it’s not just about the numbers, they can show real progress. The true win is being able to live more fully and do things I once couldn’t imagine possible. Like Bilbo Baggins said, “I think I am quite ready for another adventure.” I'm planning my next one already. What recent win or milestone has reminded you how far you’ve come?

I was Dx’d over 20 years ago. First thing I did was started a walking program. Gradually increasing my step count goal. Now I always do my 12,000 step count (roughly 6 miles at my stride). I lost almost 100 pounds slowly and have kept most of it off. I still struggle at times! I use a Fitbit to track my progress. Alternate between just Zening out enjoying nature or listening to music or a free audiobook using Libby app from local library. Keep it up!

I only cracked 30k once as part of dedicated walks though. I got diagnosed at the end of last January. It was freezing cold most days and ice in spots. I just kept walking. When the weather turned into spring and summer. I just kept walking. If it rained, I just kept walking. My neighbors thought I was nuts at first. Now one of them is on their own diabetes journey. He jokingly calls me his nemesis now as he wife keeps telling him, "If he could do it, so can you." LOL. I stay out of it. Lol
