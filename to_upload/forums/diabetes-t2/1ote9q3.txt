Heyyyyy I joined the club!!! After managing my sugar alone since Feb I finally saw an endocrinologist today. I’ll use CGM tomorrow LinX I’ll start pill Linagliptin Tradjenta tomorrow My liver enzymes even higher now than October (normal no more than 36. My two are 99 and 294) so Dr referred me to liver specialist tomorrow but he will start monitoring my sugar as soon as possible coz I’ll attach the CGM tomorrow Now I’m on orders to eat more carbs Don’t worry about sugar spike. Sugar is the least of my problem now lol Liver is. Did ultrasound- no fatty liver no fibrosis. Thus even more urgent to see liver specialist. I’m happy. The CGM makes it easier to see my sugar and the doctor can see it in real time also. I don’t feel alone now.
