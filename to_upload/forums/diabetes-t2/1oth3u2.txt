===============================================================================

I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes about 10 years ago. Over the past 2 years I have lost over 150 pounds. I still want to drop 40 more pounds to get to my target. I have been watching my diet carefully and exercising 4-5 hours in a typical week. Over the last 4 months my doctor has weaned me off meds as my A1C was 4.6% and 4.5% on my last two visits. He started by having me stop taking Jardiance. Then on my last visit about 2 weeks ago he had me stop taking Metformin and Victoza. Right now I'm taking no meds for diabetes. I am on a CGM to monitor the results. From a blood sugar perspective everything appears to be good, except it does seem to take longer that normal for my blood sugar to come back down after a meal. The only problem is that my weight loss has stalled. Right after stopping all meds my weight went up by about 4 pounds. I think that was primarily due to a change in how my body's digestive functions were working. Now, despite the intense workouts and highly limited low carb meals, I'm not losing weight like I once was. (I'd typically lose 3-5 pounds in a typical week. In the last 2 weeks now I'm up 3 pounds.) I go back to the doctor in about 3 weeks. At that visit I'd like to talk to him about adding back one of my prescription meds to help resume my weight loss. Of the 3 meds I have taken--Metformin, Victoza, and Jardiance--which one would be the best one to resume from a weight loss perspective? I will talk to my doctor before resuming, but I think if I advocated for one in particular he would likely approve. One side challenge is that my long term PCP is retiring at the end of the year so my upcoming visit will be my last one with him. I start a new doctor in March.

3. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T09:09:37]: I’m in a similar boat weight-wise and numbers you mention, minus the meds. I have about 40 to lose to my goal and it’s been a crawl. I’ve used the Weight Watchers app to lose the weight and I‘m in the process of adjusting my diet to get there.

5. u/SouperKayyyy [score=2, created=2025-11-10T11:18:01]: Are you getting enough calories with that exercise schedule? It doesn’t matter what medication you add back in, if you’re not eating enough you can’t meet your goals.
6. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=2, created=2025-11-10T12:00:35]: You seem to know what you want to do, and are looking for medication to help, but what exactly are the issues you're facing that makes you believe you need meds? All the meds do is metabolically alter the basic equation of calories in/calories out. What are the barriers preventing you from increasing your activity or reducing your caloric intake? Not being critical, just trying to understand your situation.
