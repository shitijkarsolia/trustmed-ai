===============================================================================

So I was diagnosed with a 12.4 A1C about a year ago. After five months I got it to 5.4 and with my most recent A1C I am now at 4.9. I feel so proud of myself especially with the shame and guilt I felt after being diagnoses I really beat myself up and considered myself a failure but I didn’t let this disease or stigma win. I lost over 100lbs and viewed it not as a figure but a wake up call. 😊

6. u/soulima17 [score=7, created=2025-11-10T12:50:40]: Congratulations! Diabetes is a marathon, not a sprint - but you've done a lot of the hard work already. I'm shocked and dismayed at the attitude of some T2 folks who seem driven to continue their previous ways and that argue that T2 is not (in any way) related to diet and lifestyle choices. Actions have consequences, and your decision to take action to deal with it through hard work and self-love shows others that remission and reversal is possible. One day at a time.
