===============================================================================

I'm exhausted. I have rly bad mental health on top of diabetes. And having to cook every day to make sure I get a good meal that wont spike blood sugar is not working for me rn. Having to cook brown rice for an hour instead of white that takes ten minutes. Having to find fun ways to cook veggies so they don't taste bad. I feel like I'm going insane having to do this Its not like I didn't eat greens before. But now I can't have anything but lean food I now hate it. Now i mostly just eat fiber crackers and fruit with vitamin supplements.

For me, it’s trying to do one thing right a day, maybe tomorrow or next week will be better, maybe it won’t be - but if I can at least - cook one good meal OR - one post meal walk at whatever fucking pace I want OR - brush my teeth OR - take my meds OR then I know its at least a step in the right direction, with the hope that I’ll gaslight myself into momentum 🥴😂.

Make a big salad and keep in the fridge. It will be fine for a day or two. Get low sugar yogurt cups. Cheese sticks. Almonds. Boiled eggs last a while in fridge. Make a stir fry and put a couple of meals in the fridge. You really and truly do not have to cook so much every day.

When I'm feeling lazy, I like the Sara Lee Delightful bread with peanut butter and some Good Good brand Jelly. It's all low carb enough not to spike me and it takes a minute to have a PB&amp;J and be satisfied and done. Atkins brand TV dinners aren't the best ever but their pizzas will make you feel like you cheated without spiking you. And the TV dinners tend to work okay for a meal when you don't want to cook. If you want to order out, wingstop is really easy to eat at with diabetes. Taco bell has some bowls that are fun. If you buy some low cab tortillas to keep at home, you could throw the contents of the bowls into them a make a low carb junk food buritto at home. Yeah, none of these ideas will help you lose weight or "get healthy" but they'll fit within a diet meant to keep your A1C in a range that doesn't destroy your internal organs. If you want to be "healthy" and not cook, you could always get a rotisserie chicken and a ceasar salad kit. A few croutons will fit into your carb limit and will make you feel like a human while you're still getting fiber from salad and some healthy protein from chicken. Not every meal has to be home-cooked. You can even find fun foods. Low A1C is more important than fiber and healthy right now. Get that A1C down and then focus on the greens and nutrients. It'll be easier to focus on the healthy foods when you aren't in high blood sugar land.

If it’s causing friction and trouble on a daily basis it seems like it might be time to speak to your doctor about it, or get a referral to someone else who can help.
7. u/gertymoon [score=5, created=2025-11-10T21:53:40]: One thing that has really helped me lower my numbers is just giving up rice completely, I never liked brown rice but eating white rice was always a staple in my diet. I've given up rice for what's been almost a year now and don't miss it, I'll have some if I'm craving it but seldom do. Here is my reasoning for giving up rice, a bowl of rice is like 40-50 carbs? a bowl of brown rice is like 35-45 carbs? Roughly, I don't recall exactly what they are. So would I rather eat those empty carbs or could I just eat a piece of fried chicken instead. For instance, a breast at popeyes fried chicken is about 16 carbs compared to like 30 plus carbs for a filler rice . I just go through this game with myself, would I rather eat this or have some rice. What I've also done is just have a rotation of vegetables around and allow myself to not count calories on them and just eat until I'm as full as I want to be. I can either eat them like a salad or just saute them for a few minutes and use salt, pepper, butter, and chicken bouillon on them for simplicity or do a more traditional asian stir fry with them. The veggies I go for is broccoli, zucchini or green squash, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, bok choy, various kinds of spinach and just whatever is different if I'm getting bored. Also if you are tired of having crackers as snacks, it goes back to doing some trade offs. Can I cut this from my meal and sub it for something else so then I can have a more savory snack that might have some carbs in it. Lastly, something else that has helped me control my A1C1 is just making sure I take a walk after my meals, I aim for 15 minutes and generally try to have 10k steps by the end of the day.
