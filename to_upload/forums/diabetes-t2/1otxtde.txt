Hey guys i wanted to share, i’m t2D and unfortunately it been uncontrolled for a long time (5years uncontrolled 11 years total since diagnosed) because i had a primary care physician basically wrote off all my efforts with the metformin to try to control it and put me on insulin. I was young and gullible back then and i essentially gave up. My a1c went as high as 15 in june 2025 and that was the wake up call to essentially stop being a bitch and get back at it. Now in Aug it was 6.9 and Nov i’m down to 6.4 just off basic activity, doing keto with very occasional carbs (i.e. special events like weddings and certain birthdays) i rarely drank soda even before the diabetes only water and it’s still on the lowering trajectory. I’m not asking for praise, I’m just posting for people that have given up because they were deceived by terrible PC Physicians that written them off to push medication that they might not need. If you are T2 and they tell you that all your efforts will not do shit, that is BS at its finest
