===============================================================================

Okay so I have a bit of a complicated health history here, but maybe someone has the same situation as me... To start, my A1C is 7.6 I have no thyroid due to cancer back in 2012. It's been a struggle with weight ever since + PCOS. Last year, I have zepbound a whirl but it majorly interfered with my thyroid med absorption. My doctor tried to prescribe it again given my new diagnosis, but I'm just not comfortable taking it again. So my doctor prescribed metformin ER 500mg instead. I have heard many many crazy things about this med, and I'm honestly scared to try it, but I feel like I have no other choice. Anyone had a good experience while taking it? Anyone had diabetes AND deal with thyroid issues at the same time? What's your experience been like? Thanks for any advice 🙏

And many people who can’t take the regular version without issues do well with the ER formula. Of course it makes sense you’d hear about the potential unpleasant side effects - people don’t generally run to the internet to talk about NOT having diarrhea.
2. u/ben_howler [score=4, created=2025-11-10T20:37:06]: I have been on Metformin for more than 20 years now. No issue at all. I think, Metformin is the standard med for T2Ds worldwide, and there are so many of us, you will hear the stories of those who have side effects. But the millions of us who just take it daily without much thinking and without issues, they'll not tell their stories on Reddit.
3. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=3, created=2025-11-10T20:26:55]: Some people have terrible side effects, some have zero. I'm on 1000 mg twice a day and have no issues from the Metformin, never have. The GLPs are a different story for me. Unfortunately the only way to find out is to try it. Pro-tip when taking it is to take it with food. That tends to lower the chance for side effects.
4. u/bace3333 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T02:31:11]: Metformin is wonder drug been taking for 10 years and now studies say prevents some cancers and good for heart !
5. u/AFDStudios [score=1, created=2025-11-10T20:47:34]: I take Armour and Metformin and luckily have had no issues so far (1 year plus). My reactions have been very mild, to the point that I don’t even know if I have any at all. Everyone is different of course but that’s how it’s been for me. Good luck and live well!
6. u/Dgskydive [score=1, created=2025-11-10T20:52:01]: If I believed all the horror stories about metformin, I would have been a mess. Lol. I had zero side effects and I was on 2000mg a day at first. I've also seen people complain about the side effects to have them go away in a short amount of time. Metformin has been the workhorse drug for a long long time. You can always stop taking it.
7. u/galspanic [score=1, created=2025-11-10T20:56:38]: There does seem to be some correlation between carb intake and side effects - if you give the rocket a lot of fuel it’ll send out a lot of exhaust so to speak.
8. u/wuzmal-D [score=1, created=2025-11-10T21:50:23]: Take metformin ER with food at night. It does cause issues in some people (me - I am some people ) but not as much as just metformin. I have to really watch what I am eating otherwise my belly isn't happy. This is a helpful first line of medication. Don't be afraid.
9. u/CrankyCrabbyCrunchy [score=1, created=2025-11-11T00:14:22]: Am 66F taking Metformin ER 1500mg for last 12+ years with zero problems. Now at 1000 mg after losing weight and on GLP-1.
10. u/deacc [score=1, created=2025-11-11T04:36:41]: Metformin is typically the 1st line of defense for T2. I don't have thyroid issues, my body can handle 500mg dosage at a time after meal but not 1000mg dosage at a time. It is a fantastic drug IMO. Just make sure you take it after meal or at the very least halfway into your meal so that you're not taking it on an empty stomach. I see that your doctor is already prescribing the ER version (I take the regular) so that's good as some people has GI issues with the regular version but not the ER version. But the most important non-drug related component is to adjust your diet accordingly as you learn how your body reacts to different types of carbs. And finally exercise! Walk after a meal, even just 10 minutes if you can't do longer due to time and/or strength constraints.
