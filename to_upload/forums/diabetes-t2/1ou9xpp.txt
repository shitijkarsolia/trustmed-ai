===============================================================================

Hello! So when I was first diagnosed, I was given a prescription for testing using a OneTouch Ultra 2. I've been using that for the past year. However, in the last month, I was informed that the OneTouch was no longer supported by my insurance (I called my insurance and they said that the Ultra2 was old tech so they no longer covered it) Okay, sure, fine. They shift me over to the Accu-Check Guide Me. I still have plenty of stuff left to use for the OneTouch, So I'm going to use that up before I dig into the accucheck. But I did go ahead and try it so I could see how it worked, and on one blood draw I got vastly different numbers. Enough so it makes me go 'should...should I call my doc about this?' Yesterday evening's numbers: One Touch Ultra2 - 137 Accu-check - 97 This morning's draw numbers: OneTouch Ultra2 -122 Accu-Check Guide Me - 107 How could they be \*that\* different?

So if the real lab value would be 100, meter A and can read 85 and meter B can read 115 and neither is technically wrong. Also, meters don’t have to be within 15% of a lab value 5% of the time and they would still be considered good enough.
2. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=5, created=2025-11-11T07:27:21]: The Accu-Chek Guide and Guide Me are the better meters compared to models based on older tech. If you want to compare them try testing the same (big) drop of blood with both meters. You'll find one tends to read higher than the other. This is true of almost all meters on the market that use different test strips. A meter or batch of test strips can be faulty and give a similar result but even when working perfectly there's always a 'relative bias' in the readings between different meters. The basic standard for meters (basically) says that they should be within 15% of true objective accuracy at least 95% of the time. That's plus or minus 15%, so two meters can give readings from the same drop of blood that are consistently nearly 30% apart, on average, and both still meet the basic standards. In the most recent independent study I know of the Contour Next One came out on top for accuracy, followed by the Accu-Chek Guide and OneTouch Verio Reflect. These meters are based on the most recent tech and the manufacturers have invested in producing the most accurate meters possible (and charge a premium price for the test strips). I own all three of these models along with eight others as I was interested in finding the best affordable meter(s) for calibrating CGMs with. The difference between the Contour Next One and some of the cheaper meters I own which use older technology is stark. When levels are stable such as before meals you can test over and over again with the Next and get very similar numbers. Some of the cheaper models would produce readings which jump around all over the place, and only a few of them, the Accu-Chek Guide being one, would produce readings that were consistently close to the Next. That said, the Guide almost always gives a reading that is a little higher than the Next.
3. u/psoriasaurus_rex [score=5, created=2025-11-11T08:58:39]: They are both accurate, most likely. A home meter will probably not match a lab value exactly. They can be off by 15% (higher or lower) and are still considered accurate. If you tested with 5 different meters, you’d probably get 5 different results. Pick whichever one is easier/cheaper to use and stick with it. You’ll just drive yourself crazy otherwise. Don’t get too hung up on your exact glucose number unless it’s really high or low. Look at the trends over time. Are you in range most of the time? If you’re testing before/after meals, track how the numbers trend, but don’t take a lot of notice of individual readings. Glucose also changes constantly through the day (and night). Your liver dumps glucose in your system and your pancreas releases insulin to process the glucose. This happens constantly and causes your glucose to fluctuate constantly. It’s a completely normal process of living.
4. u/mintbrownie [score=2, created=2025-11-11T13:22:42]: I’ve tested the same drop of blood twice back-to-back with the same meter and got wider variations than that! Think of a meter (fingerstick or CGM) as a tool to inform you of how you react to certain foods, emotions or exercise, to see spikes/drops and trends, and not as an accurate medical device.
5. u/OreoPumpkinSpice [score=2, created=2025-11-11T19:55:06]: I use the contour next. It was top for accuracy in a comparison paper. I've tried others and the contour matches best with my CGM and what I know about my body. You can get the strips at Costco 100 for $22. I pay for mine out of pocket since I want accuracy. My insurance wants me to use CVS TruMetrix which wasn't very good to me.
