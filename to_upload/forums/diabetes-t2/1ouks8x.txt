How do you track your glucose meter/fingerstick readings? I'm currently writing everything down in my notes app, but my log is getting long and I'm not really able to visualize the numbers well. I do also record them in my daily planner, which helps a little more, but I was wondering if there were easier ways to log and visualize the numbers. (The meter came with a booklet but I never bothered to use that.)

I use the Contour Next One meter and it has its own proprietary app. Once paired it uploads automatically and it goes back months for updating.
