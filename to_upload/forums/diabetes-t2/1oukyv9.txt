===============================================================================

This was after an hour of leg day with heavy weights followed by 25 minutes of moderate cardio. Was about 150 when I started. Curious how everyone else's body reacts to exercise.

Your body dumps glucagon from the liver to fuel your exercise. That glucagon then raises blood sugar until your muscles can suck it all up. High blood sugar is the symptom of T2D, not the cause. The cause is insulin resistance. We measure the symptom because that is easy. In the end, your body has put some excess energy to use and will be more insulin sensitive. It will replace the glucagon it spent by breaking down fat or taking it from food if you eat after. Look at high blood sugar during workout as your fat being turned to energy and put to work. Good job!

Another day, after a arm/back day (12 sets altogether, with heavy weights) and 20 minutes intense cardio, it was 261. Freaked me out, too. My doctor is fine with the spikes, but I really hate seeing that, especially since I thought exercise was supposed to help. This was at the start of both working out (I'd started about two months before my diagnosis) and while trying to get my blood sugar under control. It's a little better now, my baseline has dropped, but I still get spikes into the high 100s and low 200s just after exercise. I don't have a CGM to track how long the spikes are, but I'm usually back into the 120-130 range after two hours, as tested on a fingerstick.

Despite the temporary spike from high-intensity work, all forms of exercise are beneficial for long-term metabolic health because they improve insulin sensitivity and overall glucose regulation. Gemini helped me put this into words.
4. u/RightWingVeganUS [score=3, created=2025-11-11T22:29:23]: My blood glucose typically drops, sometimes into the 70's when I exercise. I pretty much always stay zone 1 or 2, very light to moderate exertion just to soften postprandial glucose rises. I'll walk around the neighborhood for 15-30 minutes, or bee-line home if I get an alert that my glucose dropped to 65. Now that it's getting a bit chilly I programmed a couple of post-meal workouts on my indoor cycling trainer and that are either 15 or 30 minutes long. I will end right away if I get an low-glucose alert.

6. u/herseyhawkins33 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T14:13:20]: I was actually going to create a thread about this. My blood sugar is well controlled with medication and I'm very careful with what I eat. I recently got back to playing high intensity full court basketball. When I'd check my CGM afterwards it goes into the 220s which obviously is concerning/frustrating. It does come back down relatively quickly. Anyone have tips for limiting that spike?
7. u/SharkBite58 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T14:23:41]: Mine only goes down if I’ve eaten and stays the same if I’m in the middle of “fasting”. My morning exercise routine shows no change in my CGM.
8. u/mbaggie [score=2, created=2025-11-11T14:39:36]: Gah. I shoot right past the 250’s with heavy lifting, high resistance on the bike, and HIIT sessions over 15 mins. I hover there while exerting myself, and maybe up to 15-20 mins after. Then the spike becomes a crash into the 50’s and 60’s. Super fun /s My doc shrugged it off. Said it’s a normal response to exercise in diabetics. Once I stayed elevated for a few hours after but I couldn’t figure out why. Sucks. Oh. Forgot to add: my bg goes down with moderate intensity.
9. u/Weathergod-4Life [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:57:14]: Mine doesn't go up quite this much but you likely are working out a lot harder than I am. That's quite the impressive spike!
10. u/PipeInevitable9383 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:58:09]: Highest I've captured is 155
