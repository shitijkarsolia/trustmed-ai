I'm on 10mg , almost been 30 days. Noticed my pee is foamy. But its clear , or little bit yellow. Noticed a slight burning on my left side. Has anybody experienced this?

2. u/willwar63 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T15:49:45]: It's supposed to make you pee more. It's one of the side effects and so is dehydration. All normal. If you've read into the mechanism of how this class of drugs work, you basically pee the sugar out. It comes with it's own set of side effects. Not the "normal" way of dealing with high blood sugar. By "normal", I mean hormones, insulin, glucagon etc. "SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. This leads to increased excretion of glucose in the urine, which lowers blood sugar levels. " I just started 4 or 5 days ago, I am liking it so far as far as dropping my numbers. Time will tell on the rest. I do know that for some, UTIs and yeast infections could be a problem.

If you’re concerned, maybe ask for a urine test to rule out a UTI. Not sure how your doctor’s office is set up, but mine can send an order to the lab, I just go in at my convenience to get the test. You probably don’t need a whole appointment.

What concerns me is foamy generally means kidney damage protein leak, haven’t been tested for that yet but I plan to soon. I assume the foam is most likely from the excess sugar rather than kidney damage protein leak
5. u/ThomasFromOhio [score=1, created=2025-11-11T15:27:58]: When it was given to me, I was told it would cause me to drink more water and urinate more. Little bit yellow means it's working. When I tell my GP that my urine is clear, she freaks out on me. Didn't experience the burning on the left side though.

7. u/Carliv79 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T17:12:39]: Mines occasionally foamy and all my kidney tests are perfect. Sounds like it may just be dehydration which happens easy on jardiance.

9. u/FortuneInevitable369 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T07:17:01]: Update, looks like everything came back fine. Just lots of sugar in the urine. Causing the foaming. She did say it takes about 3 months to see the symptoms go away. She also said it was overkill. She doesn't agree with my doctor putting me on it.
