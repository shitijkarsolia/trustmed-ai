===============================================================================

As of today, my doctor prescribed Rybelsus. Metformin was too harsh on my system. Is anyone on this? There was the Ozympic option, but, yeah, no. How is Rybelsus for you?

I looked at rybelsus.. one of its downsides is that max dosage is considered comparable to 1mg of ozempic - which is half of the max dose of ozempic. So it might simply be possible that you need a stronger form of the drug. The other downside is that rybelsus feedback is that its a real pain to take. restrictions around fasting with it etc.. the other downsides are the same side effects possible with ozempic. "but, yeah, no" doesn't really describe why you're concerned about ozempic. It's a great drug. If its the needle thing it shouldn't be an issue - it's a nothingburger. It's way less of a deal than a finger stick.. tiny needle, just goes under the skin - it's nothing like a vaccination or veinous blood draw. braindead simple to do. not a big deal.

It did help, but not as much as I would’ve liked, and it did give me indigestion issues like metformin. I was on the highest dose for over a year after working my way up to it, and I never did see the help that I got when I was on ozempic and now Mounjaro. I’m sorry because that’s not encouraging at all, but every body is different, and I hope that you have a positive experience! ETA: the only reason I stopped ozempic was because it randomly got too expensive, even with good insurance…

4. u/GolfballDM [score=3, created=2025-11-11T20:31:39]: I've been on Rybelsus. It's not an experience I would like to repeat. It gave me major GI issues, even when metformin doesn't. The dosing schedule is awkward. And it is easily the worst tasting maintenance medication I've had, and in the top three overall for worst taste. I much prefer my injectables.
5. u/cowrunamuck [score=3, created=2025-11-11T22:28:51]: Rybelsus is just oral semaglutide, the ingredient in Ozempic. It’s likely that if you’ve had bad side effects with Ozempic, like you say in comments here, that you’ll have similar ones with Rybelsus. I was on Rybelsus for a short period before it made me super duper nauseous, and I bailed (my doctor never explained what it was and I didn’t know to expect such bad side effects). Years later, I was put on Mounjaro and it’s been fantastic. I think any of these options are worth a shot because GLP-1s have been life changing for me. But, you do have to find the right one for you. No harm in trying Rybelsus, but it’s possible it might not be right for you. Some people do better with the injections, some people need a different peptide, etc.

7. u/MamaMaksamia [score=1, created=2025-11-12T06:07:39]: I have been taking metformin for several years. Doctor added Rybelsus in May. Appetite decreases markedly! But so does energy. I have lost almost 40 pounds and am not at the highest dose. Drawback, it is also $1000 per month. They had a discount plan but discontinued it. They may create another.
8. u/Earesth99 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T08:04:48]: Rybelsus is tge same medication in ozempic - semaglutide. The main difference is that one is a pill and the other needs to be injected. Both lower blood glucose and appear to be so beneficial that people live longer (even accounting for blood glucose and weight changes). You can get higher blood levels by injecting it so ozempic can be more effective. Both can take a little time for your body to adjust.
9. u/twistysomething [score=1, created=2025-11-12T12:49:10]: I take rybelsius with metformin. I had some nausea at the start but once I got past the 3 month mark it went away. It does decrease your appetite so you’ll likely lose weight and it’s brought my glucose way down.
10. u/SlidingOtter [score=1, created=2025-11-12T17:24:01]: I went the rybelsus route too and ended up with pancreatitis, thus preventing me from ever taking a semaglutide again. Rybelsus has pancreatitis as a known side effect. Make your your blood work includes lipase testing, a means to check the health of your pancreas
11. u/scrapstitching [score=1, created=2025-11-12T19:29:59]: I took it. I loved it. I developed side effects that were enough to make me stop taking it. I wish I could take it.
