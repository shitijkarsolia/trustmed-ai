1. u/galspanic [score=5, created=2025-11-11T20:58:45]: The link is dead and I have no idea what you’re talking about because of that, but I have yet to purchase anything related to diabetes recipes.
2. u/Oma2Fae [score=2, created=2025-11-11T22:25:08]: I's a ebook. It also suggests many other items for Download ONLY at an additional cost. I found that all items were included in the download regardless of whether or not I selected all of them for purchase or not.

4. u/ephcee [score=1, created=2025-11-12T08:29:04]: I don’t recommend spending any money on any diabetes recipes, ebooks, quick fixes, or anything. It’s all meant to capitalize on your desire to feel better but there’s no oversight of the products. Chances are high that you can get the exact same info from AI, at this point (that’s probably where they got it). All the info you need to be successful is widely available for free.
