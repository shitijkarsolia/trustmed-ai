Hi folks currently on metformin + farxiga Mounjaro was added recently but had severe vision related side effects so doctor asked me to stop. I’ve now been put on Tradjenta / Trajenta which is a DPP-4 inhibitor (along with metformin and farxiga) which I plan to start soon, curious regards to experiences and side effects? Anyone else on similar triple therapy ? Thanks

No side effect on me, fasting sugar numbers were awesome, but I think I still need a low carb diet for my post meal numbers to not spike though by 2 hours they were all below 8.5.
