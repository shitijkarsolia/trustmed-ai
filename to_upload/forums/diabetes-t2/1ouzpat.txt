===============================================================================

I am curious if anyone here has stopped their diabetes medication? I am on Ozempic 0.25 mg and Metformin 500 mg daily. I got a new job but they havent'told me when health insurance will kick in so I'm preparing to lose access to insurance and cannot afford meds without them. What should I expect when I quit these meds?

My backup plan was to switch to Metformin, which I discussed with my doctor ahead of time. When the time came, I stopped Mounjaro six months after my dignosis and ramped up Metformin slowly. My A1C stayed steady (had dropped from 11% to 5.3%) and I didn’t experience any rebound. In fact both glucose control and weight loss continued without the side effects I had from Mounjaro. For me, the key was preparing for the transition early. I focused hard on diet and lifestyle to keep things stable, especially since going off meds was always part of my long-term plan. Losing insurance is stressful, no doubt, but I found that having a plan helped keep me from panicking. Here in the US they are planning to make the GLP-1 meds more affordable, but I have no interest in going back.

And your average glucose level will likely go up 10-15 points to start. I found that with medication, foods that spiked me would come down immediately. Without it, it stays higher for longer. So you just have to adjust. It levels out after a few weeks, but it sounds like you’ll be able to go back on them by then. I have a zillion other medication’s and my neurologist has me in trials, so i needed to cut diabetes meds out completely.
5. u/yomatc [score=2, created=2025-11-12T05:53:01]: Those are really small dosages. .25mg Ozempic is considered an introductory dosage. I’m not sure its doing much for you at all. That kind of dosage is mostly used just to make sure sue you don’t have an adverse reaction. If that’s been working for you, then you can probably get off meds entirely and see how it goes. Or at least the Ozempic for sure, which is the one that you’re more likely to have insurance problems with. Getting 500mg metformin approved and cheap shouldn’t be a challenge. Definitely talk to your doctor about it.

So I got my Mounjaro script to 90 days and filled it right before the first insurance stopped and the new insurance was up before I ran out. At 0.25, you are probably still going up and more likely to fill for 30 days. What I would do is call your doctor and ask for the next highest dose and fill it for 90 days and to write it for the next highest dose, which is 1 mg. Assuming single use pens, you will now be getting 12 pens of 1 mg, which will give you double the medicine of the 0.5 mg. If you really want to stretch it, you can get empty 1 ml vials on Amazon, some bacteriostatic water and some 31g, 5/16", 0.5 ml insulin syringes. Inject the pen contents into the vial, then draw up the same volume of bacteriostatic water and also inject into the vial. This is dependant on the concentration of the medicine pen. Then draw up half of it with a new syringe and inject it and save the other half for next week . You now have 24 weeks at 0.25 and you can step up when you see fit and time it when insurance is back on. If you have a multi dose pen, just dial in a smaller dose and it will last longer. For the Metformin, try to fill the same way. But it's cheap, so not much to worry about.

Ask to get titration instructions and a 3 month supply. Probably $15 at a grocery store pharmacy or Walmart even. You may need less Metformin as you titrate your GLP. Depends on how high your A1C is and how you respond to dietary changes. Endocrinologists like fiber for treating diarrhea associated. For me, it's 10 grams with 1/2 liter of sugar free Gatorade. Re followup visit: I'd be happy to help you negotiate with the doc on getting a cash price for your follow-up in between. If it's a private office, and they do an A1C, glucose, and whatnot, $200 is more than fair in most areas of the country. If you're living in Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, LA, NYC, you could consider like $250. If it's hospital based, file for charity care so they can possibly lower your bill. Ask for a 3 month supply of CGM sensors. Depending on how high your A1C is, they may want insulin anyway, which is sometimes a requirement for the CGMs. If nothing else, get a glucometer, lancets (33g my pref) and check as directed. If you start insulin, you're going to probably need to check in with them weekly for a bit to titrate to get to a more manageable level. Idk how much metformin you're on or A1C but know that it is a possibility. That shouldn't cost too much in terms of fees if at all. Manufacturer assistance can help with the insulin and pen needles, as well as SGLT2 inhibitors as well if they decide to do that. Endocrinologists have samples which they could use if needed.

It's a lot more work than just taking meds, and more expensive for me because of the gym membership and more expensive food. But, it can be done. However, as others have said, metformin is very cheap. You can ask you your doctor to write a script for a 90 day supply now, so you have some when insurance ends.
9. u/david_fireman33 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T08:39:18]: I used to be on metformin 500 but after about 6 months the doctor said I should stop bcos my blood sugar was becoming low because I went strict by exercising daily, dropped carbs to d bare minimum etc. apparently my routine was lowering my BS with metformin too so after it wasn’t needed, you can only stop if you can control your BS on your own without it
10. u/W_Roper [score=1, created=2025-11-12T10:18:31]: Imho, you need to change your mind set. You sound resigned to dropping your meds, I think you need to do everything you can think of to stay on your meds. Tell your doctor your situation. Ask HR at your new job. Talk to your pharmacy. Pay out of pocket. You can only check your A1C every 3/6 months. So It could be a year before you get solid feedback about how your body is responding to meds, that’s along time for uncertainty and anxiety to creep in. for me that’s when I start “eating my feelings” - devouring crappy food and then it all gets worse.
11. u/Billh491 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T21:13:30]: I know when I stopped Ozempic I felt much better.
12. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T17:17:28]: The best way to manage this is to start resistance training and build muscle. Muscle acts as extra glucose storage even when insulin is low, so it makes blood sugar control a lot easier. I used to be on 2000 mg Metformin, 5 mg Glipizide, and was close to being put on insulin. I was also on 10 mg Lisinopril for blood pressure. I’ve been meds free for 6 years now and can eat normal foods without issues. So definitely look into resistance training as your main strategy if you end up off medication.
