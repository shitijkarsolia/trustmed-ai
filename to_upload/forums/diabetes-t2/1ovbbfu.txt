===============================================================================

I got a very good start by diet and exercise but sept onwards it’s been such a bad downfall and I’m just feeling so upset and mad at myself that I don’t have the will power. I give in to treats and make it a daily thing. I’m considering starting mounjaro to control an form healthy habits. Any side effects I should be careful and know about

It's also worth looking at [7.2 Oral Medications ](https://pi.lilly.com/us/mounjaro-uspi.pdf?s=pi&amp;redirect-referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmounjaro.lilly.com%2F)of the Prescribing Guide. I found it useful for timing one of my daily oral medications.

Even before I got diabetes, I tried to be responsible with my diet. At this time of year though, it's comforting pies, rich desserts and Christmas treats. I feel your pain.
