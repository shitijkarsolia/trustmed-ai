===============================================================================

I got my latest A1C and it improved from 6.3 to 6.1. Despite a steroid shot (knee). Despite a 9 day vacation. Despite 2 weeks of stress to the point of feeling traumatized. Despite not being perfect. I was dreading the result like crazy. So, I celebrated last night by eating Ben &amp; Jerry’s. It was a last minute, couldn’t seem to stop myself moment when I needed to pick up some other things. Not recommended, not proud, but my husband and I had a great laugh about it this morning. Too late to change it now anyway. Anyone else ever find ANY humor in dealing with T2? I know it’s serious, but d*** after 17.5 months it felt good to laugh at myself! (Instead of feeling terrible about it.) Today of course it’s back to day 1.
