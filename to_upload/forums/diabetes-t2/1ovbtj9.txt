A small cup of milk tea, protein powder, piece of keto bread, veggies, soup all make my sugar gross 140 in two hours That's normal. That's what food is *supposed to do*: provide energy. The challenge of diabetes is our bodies are unable to manage blood glucose within normal ranges. I've been using a CGM to better understand and manage my glucose levels. I am mindful to initiate some activity within 20-30 minutes of eating. Walking, riding the bicycle, a gym workout... *something.* I try to get in 15-30 minutes of activity. If I know I have time for a long workout I will have a heavier carb meal since I know my activity will use the glucose. With the insights from my CGM I comfortably manage my health while following a moderate carb diet of 30-60g carbs/meal.
2. u/DefyingGeology [score=3, created=2025-11-12T14:02:23]: This all sounds about right to me. FWIW the healthy range of fasting is 70-100, and healthy after meals 100-140, so you’re doing well if your meals don’t take you out of that range. For me, fats also blunt the increase but also keep my glucose higher longer. And yes, eating an earlier dinner gets my sugar lower overnight. I’ve become that early-dinner kind of old person, with a nice walk after each dinner. I guess there’s a reason that’s a stereotype. 🤷‍♀️
