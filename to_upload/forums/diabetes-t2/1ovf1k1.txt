===============================================================================

I’ve been a type 2 diabetic for a good portion of the last decade. I seriously started taking care of myself starting January 2024. First started taking the small doses and eventually made my way up to 1mg starting March of 2024. Since that time I’ve lost 60 lbs and my A1C Hoovers between 5.6 to 5.8 (at its highest it was around 10). But for the last six months , maybe longer, I’ve plateaued. I still want to get down to 160lbs (I’m at about 173lbs) and would love to reach an A1C around 5.3. I get way more food cravings now than I did last year and because of work and being a parent I don’t get to excercise as much as I use to when I started getting serious about taking care of myself starting diabetes. My endocrinologist said I could just try doubling my dosage, but also stressed this was the highest dosage. At the moment, I also take Jardiance daily, 1000mg of Metformin, a statin and Linsilpro. I turn 46 next mint and I just want to live a real long life because I’m dad with a young kid.

Plus nausea and vomiting - the vomiting seems to be the day of injection or the next and/or tied to certain foods such as salty, acidic, oily, or fried and also having too much in my stomach (not talking overeating but the slow gastric emptying means I’m dealing with 3-4 meals of food building up) Otherwise it’s a delight. Can’t say if Ozempic is the same with the gastric issues but I understand it is more likely to cause muscle loss - Mounjaro does to an effect so I do light free weights.

You don't have to do a full 2 mg. It's easy to estimate the halfway-3/4 point in the indicator, so I went to 1.5 for a while. You don't feel hungry because your stomach hasn't emptied yet. It's no surprise the stomach acts offended and spews back every now and then. At the other end, the colon's job is pulling water back into your bloodstream. So the longer it takes to come down the pipe, the dryer and harder the result. A Colace every day is your friend.
