===============================================================================

I've been on Ozempic for the better part of a year. It has helped a lot with controlling my BG. It also has been doing very well to control my appetite and I've been losing weight. Until about a month or two ago. Since then, I've found that I'm often hungry and feeling cravings, and I've started to actually gain weight. I usually get weighed about once a month. On 9/17, I was at my lowest weight. A month later, I was up 7 lbs. Two weeks later, I was up 2 more lbs. I haven't checked again since then, but I'm still noticing the feeling of hunger and generally desiring more food than before this change. Fortunately, my BG has been within range this whole time. However, I'm still concerned. Is this a familiar experience for anyone? ETA: I just saw that someone posted they are taking Ozempic 1mg. I'm taking 0.5 once/week. Should I request an increase? ETA: Thank you to all who replied. Admittedly, I could have written a better topic sentence. I wasn't really asking about the weight gain per se, but the fact that I wasn't experiencing the appetite suppression as much anymore. But I appreciate the information that I can increase the dosage. I honestly wasn't aware of that.

2. u/mangatoo1020 [score=4, created=2025-11-12T18:20:59]: Yes. I'm on max dosage and I've gained 8 pounds in the past 6 months. It no longer quiets my food noise. My glucose level is well controlled though

There is no magic bullet, unfortunately. I reckon that I lost ~half a metric ton during my life, and it was and always is a mental challenge more than anything else. GLP-1s help you somewhat along the way, but you will still have to fight. So, fight, tiger, fight! :-)

5. u/wndrgrl555 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T18:18:23]: I am on 1mg a week and have had about 5 kilos of weight gain in the last six months.
6. u/CrankyCrabbyCrunchy [score=1, created=2025-11-12T20:22:30]: Definitely. Same with any 'diet' program - if you eat too many high calorie foods. Some people don't have much appetite suppression. Frankly, I never let the excuse of "I am full" to stop me from eating more.
7. u/ephcee [score=1, created=2025-11-13T05:26:57]: It is possible! You can talk to your doctor about increasing the dose to 1mg or possibly switching to Mounjaro which has been much more effective for me. Worth the convo.
