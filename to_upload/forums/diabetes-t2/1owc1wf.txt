===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I (F 28) have been dealing with a problem and would appreciate any kind of advice. Last year my a1c was 5.1 and fasting blood sugar 78. Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed agoraphobia. In October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.

I’ve maintained the loss but guess what, I’m still a diabetic. Ask to get a cgm (continuous glucose monitor) much easier to track than finger sticks. Bi started Mounjaro at the end of July and my numbers have been amazing. Spikes come right back down after eating

Your body (when it works properly) is actually quite amazing at maintaining homeostasis, including your blood glucose levels. You didn’t get diabetes because you ate a shitty diet for a while. You already had it, so your body doesn’t process the bad diet very efficiently. But that said, there’s no need to freak out. 7.3 isn’t a horrible a1c. You can get your glucose levels back under control with diet, lifestyle and/or meds. Listen to your doctor’s advice, see a dietician and maybe a therapist if needed. You’ve got this.🙂

5. u/W_Roper [score=2, created=2025-11-13T14:31:00]: As far as I know, having a second A1C test that is over 6.5 means you have diabetes. You should reach out to your doctor about possibly having another A1C test. However, whether you have it or not, you have to start working on getting your blood sugar under control. I recommend seeing a diabetic dietician, also through your doctor’s office. It’s normal to be overwhelmed by the diagnosis, but as another poster said. You’ve got this.

8. u/Rosevkiet [score=1, created=2025-11-14T10:46:58]: Diabetes is a condition that responds best to moderation in pretty much everything. Steady sleep, stress, exercise, eating patterns. All that stuff. Hitting a moderate diet with good sleep and exercise that you can consistently stick with is better than going zero carbs, monitor blood sugar constantly. Try to slow down, do some box breathing, and identify 1-2 things you can change this week and stick with (e.g. take a 15 min stroll after lunch, good for every part of your body). Two other things to do: (1) get referred to a diabetes educator, as soon as possible. There is a lot to understand about this condition and knowledge always helps me with anxiety. (2) get treatment for your panic disorder. One last thing - if your doctor actually told you that you need to “just calm down” when you’re experiencing panic attacks? You need a new fucking doctor. Being diabetic, especially one diagnosed with a not too high A1C is manageable. And the behaviors that treat diabetes are frankly how every person should be treating their body. You just have an extra incentive to do so.
