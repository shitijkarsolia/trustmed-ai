===============================================================================

Hey! I have a freestyle libre 3 I put on last night at 5 pm and it’s been reading low. It’s 3:45pm here and it’s still low. Not quite 24 hours. I’ve tested myself so many times because I’ve gotten several low warnings and my blood sugars have been no higher than 130 or less than 100 when testing. And it’ll read sort of normal for a second then randomly drop 40 points. Is this a case of the sensor adjusting still or this a faulty sensor? I’ve used a Dexcom and had less issues. It was pretty accurate only being 5-10 off.

4. u/smurfette8675309 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T08:28:41]: Sounds like a faulty sensor, or faulty placement. I'd call them for a replacement. I've done it before, and they're really good about replacement. They do ask a bunch of ridiculous questions, and they'll probably want you to send them the old one, so hang into it.
