===============================================================================

Hello all! I am going to see my primary care provider tomorrow morning about my constant thirst and urination. My diabetes diagnosis was in March of this year and i was at a 6.6 but my symptoms started in the summer. When I started experiencing these symptoms I thought it was because my A1C was still high but I've had two subsequent tests done and have been at a 5.8 and a 5.6. From the middle of summer up to this day ive been peeing 10 to 15 times a day and drinking a ton of liquids. The sensation to pee creeps up on me after around 45 minutes and most of the time I pee a decent amount but sometimes its only a little. Ive been trying to figure out what is causing this but im not sure. I have an appointment tomorrow and hope I can get some answers but feel like it might not happen. Ive looked online and saw a few potential causes of this issue. 1. Hyperinsulinemia: where the body creates too much insulin and cant use it since we are insulin resistant. Frequent thirst and urination are symptoms. 2. Diabetic prostate: where diabetes damages the prostate and can lead to frequent urination and UTIs, among other things. 3. Neuropathy of the Bladder: where neuropathy damages the bladder leading to excessive urination and always feeling like you didnt empty out your bladder after you pee. 4. Medication: I take Fluvoxamine 200mg daily and one effect is dry mouth, so maybe that's what's making me extra thirsty. I doubt this is the issue as I didnt have dry mouth before my diabetes started while on this medication. It's one thing to just experience these bothersome symptoms by themselves but unfortunately, they can cause damage down the road. Im worried about these persistent symptoms damaging my kidneys. The frequent dehydration can eventually lead to kidney disease and i really dont want that. I had a creatinine test done a few weeks back and I believe they were at a 1.04 when they should be below a 1.02. Creatinine can indicate how well your kidneys function. I dont know why I am feeling this way, ive tested my blood glucose a handful of times the last week and a half and they are in the normal range. I hope it isnt anything bad. Im only 29 and im worried these symptoms will stay with me forever. Are you guys familiar with any issues of the Bladder/Prostate or hyperinsulinemia and have you had kidney disease from diabetes? Thanks
