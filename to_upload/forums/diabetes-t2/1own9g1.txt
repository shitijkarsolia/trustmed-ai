===============================================================================

I'm prepping for a 10-hour road trip tomorrow and made some snacks to keep things steady and satisfying and keeping glucose under control. Here’s what I’ve packed: * Overnight Oats (for breakfast) * Hummus with carrot and celery sticks * Roasted spiced chickpeas * Savory Curried Oat Bites * Date energy balls (kept the glycemic index low) * Baked tofu "jerky" I'll also bring a few dates in case I get a low-energy warning. Trying to keep things balanced with fiber, protein, and some slow carbs. I like having stuff on hand so I’m not stuck grabbing mystery food at a gas station. Plus I'm cheap! Will be on a flight in a few weeks and will tweak for that trip. Curious what others here pack for travel days. Any go-to snacks or smart meals you swear by when you're on the road for a while?

2. u/deadlyscorpio [score=3, created=2025-11-14T07:12:52]: Pork rinds and leaves of lettuce.
3. u/Ikeamademedoit [score=2, created=2025-11-13T21:59:42]: Ive made chips/crisps with egg whites and some seasoning. Once cooled pack them in a baggie and good for days, super easy to make. My husband also likes greek yoghurt and blueberries but you need a cooler. You can also get low carb tortillas, cut and bake them for nachos chips
4. u/va_bulldog [score=2, created=2025-11-14T00:28:12]: I’d do almonds, strawberries, cantaloupe, hardboiled eggs, or maybe tuna if I had a way to keep it cool. Wife makes cookies with cashews, coconut, pistachios, and chocolate chips, I’d be sure to pack a couple of those 😋.
5. u/fluidsdude [score=2, created=2025-11-14T02:36:27]: Greek yogurt, protein enhanced granola, chia, honey and blueberries! Assuming you have a cooler…
6. u/Competitive-Fee2661 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T04:19:41]: That tofu jerky sounds pretty good! How do you make it?
7. u/FWIW47 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T05:41:31]: I often have nuts, cheese, and apple or pear slices Sometimes I'll add tortilla chips or whole grain sun chips (small serving) if I'm wanting a crunchy snack
8. u/Wonderful-Tea3940 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T23:24:21]: Mixed nuts or peanuts (need to read the ingredients..should be only nuts and salt) String cheese
9. u/alexmbrennan [score=1, created=2025-11-14T05:32:11]: 10 hours? Nothing. I don't get up at 3am to snack either.
10. u/Top_Cow4091 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T09:16:34]: Oats would spike my ass off
11. u/Nightcaste [score=1, created=2025-11-14T09:26:14]: Your list makes it seem like you don't do animal protein. If that's just a coincidence, I would recommend something called Hunter Sausage. It's usually in the same kind of category as beef jerky, although it's not a insanely expensive. If SlimJims are a horrible disgusting ripoff of anything in particular, it's probably hunter sausage.
