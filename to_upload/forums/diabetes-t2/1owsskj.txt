Hi. What are best drug combinations out there which are affordable. Insurance is really really expensive where I live. Further, new drugs are just way too pricey.(Ozempic, Mounjaro, Trucility etc..) I have been using Humulin 70/30 and Synjardy.

Synjardy is about $600 a month. DPP4 like Januvia is prob only going to help like 0.5-1 point on A1C. It may be more cost effective to apply to patient financial assistance for these companies if you can't afford these drugs and insurance isn't covering. Tresiba is the gold standard but
