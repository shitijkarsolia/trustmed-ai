Change/improve diet, control weight, add exercise to the daily routine. Lot of people struggle because they don't accept the fact that their health is important, especially when you don't feel the symptoms.

Up until that point, managing my blood sugar was hard and a lot of guesswork. When I ended up with poor results, I would feel defeated and think 'what's the point?' This would lead to a long run of bad eating habits and even worse numbers. It isn't a magic bullet, but wearing a CGM suddenly made everything clear to me. What was confusing and mysterious to me before was now simple and obvious. Something about seeing that visual representation just made everything click. It also helped me identify foods that I thought were safe for me that actually weren't, and others that I was avoiding that are actually fine. My diabetes is now very well managed (last three A1C's were 5.4, 5.2 and 5.3). Knowing that it is so well managed helps me mentally handle when I have a setback or make a mistake and eat something that spikes me more than expected. It doesn't feel like the end of the world, because I know I can get right back on track. If you haven't been prescribed one, I would recommend asking your doctor about trying one. Even if just for 30 days, you can learn a lot in those 30 days.
