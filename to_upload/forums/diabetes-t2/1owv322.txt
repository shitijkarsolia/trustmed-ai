===============================================================================

Just diagnosed this past week, I accept that lifestyle changes need to be both made and maintained for the rest of my life, need to lose weight, exercise more, eat and sleep better etc. I am just sad because with Thanksgiving and Christmas (italian family, 7 fishes), I feel like I am not going to be able to eat much, and feel like I am going to be miserable. For those that have been doing this for awhile, how do you manage? Do you let go for a day or two, or if not, what do you do to make it easier? Does the occasional "bad" meal, or occasionally having some carbs or sweets, as long as you dont go overboard and get back to it after, hurt you much in the long run? This is really disheartening, any input, advice, or thoughts are much appreciated. This is all so new

2. u/redsleeve [score=14, created=2025-11-14T05:57:03]: It takes time to come out of that depressed stage. For the holidays, I’d just eat what I want but also keep in mind the portion size and making sure I’m hydrated. You gotta find that middle ground between managing your sugar level and being able to enjoy life. It doesn’t make sense to go extreme on neither end, and you won’t be able to do it for a long time. You can have those carbs and candies as long as you’re mindful about it.

He always reminds me that what actually matters is my A1C and the occasional indiscretion isn't as problem. Of course, be careful with alcohol because it can lower blood sugar dangerously. Which is especially important to be mindful of very recently after diagnosis because you don't yet know how your body will react to the drugs you are newly on, and then the addition of alcohol.
4. u/thegerl [score=9, created=2025-11-14T05:59:26]: Meals don't have morality in my opinion. I was diagnosed last year right before my birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. My diabetes educator and registered dietician (I recommend both!) encouraged me to focus on building a "diabetic plate" and eat festive meals in moderation on Celebration days. Regardless of the day, I eat three square meals and limit portioned celebration sweets to after one meal per day. If you focus on what you can add to your diet and lifestyle to be healthier, like fresh salads, roasted veg, lean protein, and walks after meals, it's much more satisfying than focusing on what you "can't" have.

6. u/ephcee [score=8, created=2025-11-14T06:17:25]: I know a lot of people balk at medications but this is a solid reason to have that conversation with your doctor. The right medication can mean you don’t have to bear the cognitive and emotional load of constantly trying to stick to a perfect diet. Chronic disease burnout is real! Dietary and other lifestyle changes will absolutely help the medication work more effectively, but it can also help you reduce inflammation enough and improve insulin sensitivity enough, that you can enjoy a festive meal with your family without dire consequences. Just something to think about! Edit to add: You can’t out medicate a bad diet. But medication is another tool in the toolbox.
7. u/Aggressive_Battle264 [score=3, created=2025-11-14T06:32:07]: I feel ya - not Italian but I LOVE Thanksgiving. I love all the Thanksgiving foods and I love to cook them. I've even done a seven fishes meal once. I just eat them for the most part. Definitely not in the portions that I used to before my diagnosis, but no one is going to take them away from me on one of the very limited occasions when I eat the carbs that I pass on the rest of the year, especially the stuffing! Focus on the veggies and protein, but have some of the carbs. Just keep your portions reasonable. Maybe avoid the yams with the sugar and marshmallows if that's on your table but have a piece of pie and go for a walk.
8. u/Pale-Cauliflower2737 [score=4, created=2025-11-14T07:17:24]: My dietician says to get lots of protein and fiber. Then when you eat the sweet and carby stuff (in moderation) it will help you have less of a spike. You’ll still spike, but it won’t be so bad. It’s just one day. Just stay on your new diet after until the next holiday. Also, don’t take leftovers. I feel it makes me want to go into bad habits if I have holiday leftovers. For me, with desserts or carbs, I want one of everything so I ask my sister or my partner for a small bite of what they get, or I serve myself only a bite of something if that’s an option. My family gets it and doesn’t give me too much of hard time. I end up with a small bite of everything and I don’t miss out or overload myself with sugar or carbs and feel miserable later.
9. u/Kind-Ad-7382 [score=3, created=2025-11-14T05:53:19]: My personal opinion is that a one-meal controlled enjoyment of foods that are higher in carbs is not a huge problem. It is the days of high carb leftovers and sweets that make the problem.Take a minute and think which celebration foods are most important to you. Think about portion size. Think about balance. If you eat pasta, for example, try to keep it to 1/4 of your plate. Fill another quarter with protein, such as baked fish. Fill half the plate with vegetables. Don’t go back for seconds, or if you do, make it just a taste/spoonful. Take a 10 minute walk right after your meal. When you get dessert, try to confine it to about three bites worth. Take a walk/help clean up/get moving for a bit after dessert. It is really hard when everyone around you is throwing caution to the wind and eating as if there is no tomorrow, so be gentle with yourself.
10. u/yomatc [score=3, created=2025-11-14T07:31:08]: I enjoy myself during the family gatherings, but stick to better food for the rest of the holiday season. At my son's birthday party, I had a piece of cake, but that is the only slice of cake I've had in 2025. For Thanksgiving this year I am looking forward to my wife's turkey dressing and other dishes. We're just making less of them than in the past. She was never big on leftovers, but I would eat leftovers for a week afterward. Now we're just making enough for the day. Assuming your T2, you can't really ruin your health with a single bad meal, especially if you've been doing a good job the rest of the time. You just have to be disciplined and not let one good meal turn into an entire season of bad eating.
