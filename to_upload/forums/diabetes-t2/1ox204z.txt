===============================================================================

Quick backstory - I've been overweight since childhood, avoided doctors as an adult specifically because I was afraid of being diagnosed as diabetic, finally went and got a bloodwork panel done yesterday and they called me back today with an Rx for Metformin and a meeting next week to go over specifics. Presuming the goal is getting my A1C number low enough and that I follow the usual guidelines for food and portions, what's the benefit of monitoring my blood sugar every time I eat something?

Moreover, things like sleep, stress, and even the weather can influence your blood sugar levels. As you get to know what your body does, you won't need to test as often and may get better at predicting how things will impact you. For now though, you are your own little chemistry experiment. I learned pretty quick that my anxiety has a big impact. Sometimes things like attending a party can keep my bg elevated to 140-160 even if I haven't eaten anything but salad without dressing. I also learned that I can have fruit and potatoes with no problems, but almost any amount of pasta is rough on my bg. CGMs are also very helpful (like the difference between looking at photos and watching a video, it's a more complete picture). Testing can also help keep you accountable. We're playing a long game and while it's okay to make mistakes and good to occasionally indulge and enjoy things, humans are generally bad at long term thinking. It's easy to get burned out or overwhelmed and lose sight of the big picture goals.

For example Splenda spikes my BS. I had no idea until I got a CGM that it was doing that. Just that alone allowed me to avoid a spike to 300 almost every day!

I believe an increase of 30% or more from where you started at the first bite of your meal is a spike and not just a normal rise in blood sugar. I’m not a doctor.

You can go with the blanket approach of carbs bad if you want to but it’s not a one size fits all thing. Some people even sugar substitute hurts them even though there are no carbs or sugar in them. Once you get a good idea of what is good or bad then you can make that choice of no monitoring daily and just doing A1C tests. Once I got to 5.4 A1C I only do A1C my last one being 4.9 but if it goes up into and territory again I will do cgm figure out what I am doing and work from there

8. u/poppykat13 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T18:43:41]: Sorry you've joined our supper shitty club, but welcome 😆 It's a valid question, one that doesn't always get talked about at appointments. Learning your body can be helpful, it can also be frustrating and heartbreaking when you feel like you've done everything right, and your body just doesn't cooperate. But in the long run you start to know your patterns, and ultimately understand how to eat what you want in a functional way.
9. u/CopperBlitter [score=1, created=2025-11-14T20:07:56]: Reasons for checking blood sugar: 1. How am I doing relative to diagnosis time? 2. How did what I just ate affect my blood sugar? 3. Should I eat now or should I wait? 4. How does this exercise affect my blood sugar? Check when you first get up to see fasting blood sugar and dawn phenomenon. Check preprandial (before eating) to see if you really should eat. Check 1 hour and 2 hours postprandial (after first bite) to see how food impact you. You don't need to be doing the pre- and post-prandial checks all the time, but should do them occasionally and when you try new foods.
