===============================================================================

My dad's blood report came back in and he's 56 years old. His glucose is at 190mg/dL. His last two results back in 2023 and 2022 were 129mg/dL and 115mg/dL. His A1C is 10.4. The last two results were 7.0 and 6.8. His BUN/Creatinine and LDL were kind of high too. 30 and 146. It have been related to being dehydrated and with the cholesterol, I'm going to do my best to help him lower his oily food intake. I don't know what to do with the rest. I feel like he's been controlling what he eats, but clearly it isn't enough. Does anyone here see a dietician? I've always wanted him to create a strict diet plan. I know there's a plethora of information on this subreddit, but I'm also scared as much as I'm asking for help. I've been reading some other threads and here are some things I've going to encourage/enforce my dad to do. \- eliminate white rice and other carbs entirely and replace them with quinoa and other replacements \- 30 minute walks after dinner. He works during other meals, so he isn't able to walk. \- Really focus on limiting simple carbs and replacing them with fruits, veggies, meat, fibers, etc. \- My dad snacks throughout the day. It'll be stuff like nuts like peanuts. Is this good or bad for a diabetic?

I’m only a year younger than your dad, and I cannot imagine relying on my children to manage my health unless my husband I were incapacitated. He’s not elderly and confused. So that means he’s in charge. He needs medication, likely insulin, ASAP. That requires him to accept that he has diabetes, make the doctor’s appointment, and follow through. If he won’t do these things, and especially if he’s low-key implying his health is your job, you have to drop the rope (unless he is incapacitated). You have to say “Dad, these are numbers that will likely cause you to lose your sight and possibly a foot if you don’t go to the doctor. I can’t help you if you won’t help yourself.” I’m being deliberate in mentioning blindness and loss of limbs. Many diabetics in denial will have a mentality of “so what, I’ll die on my terms” (black and white thinking). Reminding them that it’s not a straight line but they actually are likely to live, blind and without feet, can sometimes shake the denial. (The logic: once someone is treated for blindness/foot issues, they are finally treated for diabetes.) And even then, he might still choose to sail the River Denial. You have to let him. As I said, you can’t run someone’s race for them, no matter how hard you try.

Those are numbers high enough to be treated with medication. Is he aware what those numbers mean? Is he accepting of needing to change a whole lot of things? Was he out on meds when it was 10.4? Yes his diet needs to change, ideally a meeting with a nutritionist to get him started. You wanting to support him is great, but get him started with Dr first. Let them break the bad news of radical diet changes.
3. u/Jerseygirl2468 [score=6, created=2025-11-14T13:44:37]: Those are all good steps, but he should be consulting with a doctor and likely needs medication.
4. u/fluidsdude [score=6, created=2025-11-14T13:48:49]: Needs to work on stress mgmt, sleep, exercise, protein, and fiber… those are all big levers in the battle!
5. u/sheilagiffin [score=2, created=2025-11-14T13:39:25]: Berries and walnuts for morning snack. Egg whites with veggies and a yogurt for lunch. Mini peppers for afternoon snack. A somewhat healthy supper. It's OK to have carbs if he works out after. Carb cycle. Work outs have to be consistent. If no results with 1 workout. Go for a morning walk and an afternoon workout.
6. u/MissThinksALot3012 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:48:13]: Doctor consultation and CGM! I feel that without CGM, all diabetics are flying blind so to speak. As he is diabetic range now, insurance should cover CGM. It will give excellent insights into how food, sleep, stress, and activity levels are affecting his blood sugar, and he will be able to make changes that would actually make him better. I so wish there was something like this for my dad. He was a diabetic for 35 years. His struggle to keep blood sugar in check did not result in much, partly because he was a total foodie :) But I now think he would've been able to eat in moderation and maintain decent levels if he used CGM. thankfully, he did not suffer any organ damage. He lived to his 80s. One thing he never missed- 45-60 long walks every day.
7. u/BrettStah [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:49:08]: Not sure if he has excess fat to lose, but I'm a similar age, and my A1C% was 8.3% with a fasting glucose of 178, in March of 2024, and I weighed over 350 pounds. My A1C% is now 4.9%, I've lost over 135 pounds, and my fasting glucose is 85. I'm now strength training 2-3 times a week and getting plenty of fiber and protein. My secret? Listening to my doctor! My doctor told me to give Mounjaro a try, and that if I didn't take it seriously I'd wind up going blind and likely losing some toes. Well, apparently I'm a Mounjaro super responder (lost 40% of my starting weight), and that plus overhauling my diet and adding resistance training has changed my health completely. I can now, on occasion, eat whatever I want to eat without any dangerous glucose spikes, since my diabetes symptoms are reversed. But I don't push my luck with this - mostly I eat healthy foods.
8. u/GreenLetterhead4196 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T13:32:09]: Your plan for him sounds great. I’m not a doctor. Peanuts are great or unsalted cashews or pistachios. Of course encourage him to “eat to his meter” and check his sugars before he eats and 2 hours after.
9. u/CallNResponse [score=2, created=2025-11-14T15:07:47]: I’d assume that the doctor will contact him to discuss his numbers. And speaking from personal experience, a CGM would be a very good thing. I get no joy from mentioning this, but … your attitude about controlling your father’s diet and other behavior is somewhat alarming. It’s one thing to be supportive; “enforcing” is another thing entirely. I’m sure you mean well, but attempting to be Food Police for another person is not a good idea.
