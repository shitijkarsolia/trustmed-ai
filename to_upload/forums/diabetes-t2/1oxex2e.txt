Hi asking people who are baking or cooking with low sugar alternates. Been wanting to try Stevia or sucralose replacement for sugar. Thinking about maybe muffins or something and others. Have you made food with them, how is it turned out? I have tried the sugar-free cake and brownie mixes and they are great.

1. u/temperedolive [score=6, created=2025-11-14T18:48:35]: I use Stevia quite a bit, and bake with almond flour. Keep in mind it's not a 1-1 substitution; you're going to want to experiment to get ratios right.
2. u/Charloxaphian [score=7, created=2025-11-14T18:49:20]: I've had better luck with allulose, personally.
3. u/SlowDescent_ [score=4, created=2025-11-14T23:08:07]: My experience with artificial sweeteners was dismal. Most of the ones I tried made my blood sugar spike worse than actual sugar. And none of them tasted palatable. Plus, some of them disrupt metabolic function. Now I use real sugar. But waaay less and only once in a while. And I add protein to my baked goods - cottage cheese, or nuts, or whey protein powder. And make sure to eat a baked good with a side of protein.
4. u/mintbrownie [score=3, created=2025-11-14T19:04:21]: I use an allulose-monkfruit blend. Allulose is the closest I’ve found to sugar, but it’s not very sweet. The monkfruit pushes the sweetness up enough that you can pretty much do a one-for-one swap with sugar. Everything else I’ve tried is absolutely awful.

6. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=5, created=2025-11-14T18:58:25]: Sucralose has more damaging effects than anything else. They even have new studies showing how it has affected the brain besides the gut. Stevia, monk fruit and allulose are better options. However, I had severe stomach cramps when I tried Allulose. But it seems to work for some other people. I found a monk fruit to be a bit, bitter in its purest form and that’s why you will never find too many products out there with just monk fruit. They either add erythritol or dextrose. I would stick with Stevia as it also helps with insulin sensitivity. Of all the Stevia, I tested, micro ingredients brand available to Amazon was the sweetest with the least to no after taste. You also don’t need a whole lot, so you might have to try adding it a pinch at a time
7. u/Successful-Call-6574 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T20:39:21]: I use xylitol it's natural does not bother my blood sugar. It won't break down like sugar substitutes. I get from the natural grocer store , the brand name is xylosweet. It's also available on Amazon.
8. u/slaveofacat [score=2, created=2025-11-14T23:47:57]: I prefer monkfruit/allulose-monkfruit blend. It's a straight one to one conversation and less expensive around me. Stevia tends to get overpriced/price gouged for me locally.
9. u/StatisticianCalm4448 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T22:55:09]: Does poppi have suralose?
10. u/VeniABE [score=1, created=2025-11-15T01:08:59]: It depends on the recipe. Some things like cookies and ice cream have the sugar being used for features beyond sweetness. I cannot stand stevia and have limited tolerance for sucralose. I am experimenting with advantame right now. In cases where you need sugar physically erythritol or allulose will be your friend. You can make some progress on ice cream with alcohol as well. I plan to make the family chocolate fudge recipe this christmas with a bunch of allulose instead of sugar. Technically erythritol and allulose are sugars, just we can't digest them. This means they can cause indigestion and you should eat them in small amounts until your body adjusts; or expect potential gas pains and diarrhea.
