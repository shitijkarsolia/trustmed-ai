===============================================================================

My mother is diabetic from around 10+ years while she was on medicine and no diet control we recently got the cgm and got the diet fixed to reduce the spikes within a month we are already down from 11 to 8 without medicine while there are some concers : 1) i got her started to do weight training every morning while she is little underweight and we have to increase weight as well. 2) Her morning gulucose stays(fasting) between 130-150 while she do not eat anything after 7pm meal which is usually chicken breast + veggies+ omlette her fasting is not coming to normal range of 90-100 recently started with 500mg metaformin with dinner but no change. 3) almost 80%of the day she is under 180 and max 200 after lunch. Any recommendations on how we can increase weight , reduce morning levels.

Building muscle for the elderly is complicated, the dietician told me, so she asks me to eat 150 to 200 grams of meat per meal (man) to have enough protein and not lose too much muscle mass and to continue doing the famous 10,000 steps per day to maintain the muscles…. So protein and physical “effort”. My mother, who is 86 years old, is trying to get her to eat more meat: it's complicated for her to even eat it 2 or 3 times a week because it disgusts her. So I encourage him to replace cans of tuna, sardines and mackerel with eggs, and take cheese and natural yogurt for his daily doses: not easy...
