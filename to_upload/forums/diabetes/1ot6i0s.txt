===============================================================================

Hi all! I’m new to this so if I phrase things wrong or if something doesn’t make sense, forgive me! My partner recently had a doctor’s appointment and received the news that they’re pre diabetic. I’m the cook of our household and researching has made me realize I have zero idea how to include pre diabetic friendly meals into what I already make. I usually make a lot of Mexican foods like birria, pozole, mole enchiladas, flautas, tortas, and many more but I want to transition into more like ceviche, tofu, salads, but I just can’t find a good recipe that doesn’t include two cans of garbanzo beans and plain Greek yogurt. We like flavor! With that being said, PLEASE TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE FOODS! let me know what you enjoy! Your favorite hacks! Substitutes! Anything! I want to add more to My list of meals I can cook that are friendly! I’ve been making lettuce wraps lately with chicken, bell peppers, and avocados in everything but I need more recipes!!! Thank you ahead of time for any help I get, I really appreciate this being a Reddit group :)

2. u/Denydra [score=6, created=2025-11-10T04:45:23]: In addition to the usual, decrease carbs and increase protein and fat, increase veggies, etc., I would add the following: Because all bodies are different, there is no "bad" or "good" food. When I was first diagnosed, I spent a LOT of time testing , a lot more often than the Dr. suggested, sometimes as often as 8 or 9 times a day. I also kept copious notes for a while so I could track patterns. To make this less monetarily painful, I picked up a secondary tester for this at Walmart since their testers and strips (Relion) are cheap. This is how I figured out that, while other people react very badly to corn, I do not. Corn tortillas and popcorn are actually pretty safe for me in moderation, probably because I have eaten corn bread all my life so my body grew up adapting to it. I also consider dried beans a fairly safe food in moderation. Another trick that can be useful: some carbs (pasta being a big one) break down slower depending on if it was just cooked, cooked and then cooled, or cooked, cooled and then reheated. Reheated spaghetti has very little effect on my blood sugar while just prepared pasta will make it skyrocket. Boil-in-bag rice tends to be safer for me than traditionally prepared rice. Finally, "fattier carbs" are safer than plain ones., i.e. cheesecake is a better option than birthday cake. I now test once a day, per doc's recommendations; although, I will occasionally do a day of many tests just to check in and see if anything has changed.
3. u/Intelligent-Wear-114 [score=4, created=2025-11-10T05:53:22]: For Mexican food, eat fajitas, just don't eat the tortillas. I can eat up to 1/2 cup of refried beans. They have carbs, but they have enough protein, fat and fiber that it slows down your digestion of it, so it doesn't spike your blood glucose. No rice though. Guacamole is great, and all you need is avocado, chopped green chilies, fresh garlic and fresh lime (juice and grated peel). No chips, though - dip fresh vegetables like jicama or use as a topping, for example on omelettes. Baked egg frittata (like a quiche but with no crust), with almost anything added to the eggs. We prefer broccoli or mushrooms, but you could add just about any vegetable or meat. For Asian food, we favor Egg Foo Yung, which is high in protein and low in carbs (as few as 4 grams of carbs per serving). But pretty much any Asian stir-fry dish is low-carb, as long as it's meat and vegetables, and you don't eat the rice or noodles. Curry is OK, as long as it's meat and vegetables but no potatoes, and as long the sauce has no added sugar, and you use a light amount of the sauce. Don't eat the rice. Hummus is OK, as long as it is rich and high in fat, and you eat small servings and use vegetables to dip into it, not pita chips. Cheese is basically carb-free and is a good source of protein and calcium. It's a frequent component of our diet. Cheese does contain a lot of saturated fat, though, so it should be eaten strictly in moderation if your cholesterol level is a concern for you. Low fat or part skim cheeses are healthier from a standpoint of fat. My husband makes us grilled cheese sandwiches on 100% whole wheat bread. There are carbs in rhe bread but also fiber and protein. This combined with the fat and protein in the cheese help to slow duwn digestion and avoid a blood glucose spike. Oatmeal can be eaten as long as it's made from rolled oats or steel-cut oats, and not quick-cooking oats or instant oatmeal. The process of cooking oatmeal, refrigerating it until cold, then reheating it the next day creates "resistant starch" in it. The resistant starch is less likely to create a spike in blood glucose. For me, nuts and peanuts don't spike my blood glucose. Again, the fat, protein and fiber help in them slow everything down. Buy peanut butter with no sugar added, or grind your own like you can do at Winco Foods. Everyone metabolizes food differently, though. Some foods cause a spike in some people while others don't. Pastries and desserts are typically carbohydrate bombs. Avoid sugar and recipes with sugar added, whether white or brown sugar. Avoid white flour or any refined grains. For sweeteners, use sugar substitutes, and there are many to choose from now. But stay away from sweeteners that include maltodextrin as an ingredient listed, as maltodextrin has a high glycemic index and will cause a spike in glucose, even if the main sweetener such as stevia doesn't. There are recipes for desserts that are sugar-free and relatively low in carbohydrates. These are fine to eat as long as the portion size is small. The overall carbohydrate content of your diet each day is important, and hydration is also very important, so stay hydrated all the time. Water helps your kidneys filter out excess glucose and that's an easy way to eliminate excessive glucose from your body. Exercise also helps a lot, and taking a walk after a meal helps prevent or eliminate excessive glucose from your body.
4. u/Rachaelelizabeth04 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T00:33:58]: It’s all about upping protein and decreasing carbs. Avoid tortillas, rice and beans unfortunately. Lots of meat and veggies are the remedy.
5. u/AniseLang [score=2, created=2025-11-10T01:10:01]: Crispy roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze, teriyaki meatballs, green salad with cubed tofu and roasted sesame dressing or onion dressing, Greek salad (but without lettuce), halibut ceviche, carne asada
6. u/david_fireman33 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T06:56:13]: Go heavy on proteins beans, fish, lean meat, chicken and vegetables, if they want to do carbs then they must (dilute) them, meaning small portion of carbs with larger protein portion as this would reduce a spike in their blood sugar as the body will absorb but carbs + protein together unlike absorbing only carbs alone
7. u/GreenLetterhead4196 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T07:20:49]: It may also be things like genetics that can’t be controlled. How’s his sleep? Stress? Other drinks? Does he drink water for real? I find these are huge factors. Also less night time or late night eating. I’m not a doctor, I just kept diabetes away for 6 years.

9. u/Eeyore_ [score=2, created=2025-11-10T09:27:26]: I have only been diagnosed since December 31, 2024, so my experience is rather limited. I have changed my diet on January 1st and on to be as close to no-carb as is reasonable. Vegetables have some carbs in them. I do not eat bread, rice, potatoes, or other carbohydrate forward foods. One thing I have done is, alongside taking Mounjaro, I have drastically changed my eating habits. Now, I do a lot of meal prep on Sunday, and then it's so much easier to make healthy choices throughout the week. Sunday Prep Pro Tips: * I peel and chop 2-3 lbs of carrots into sticks and put them in a container in the fridge. * I chop a head of broccoli and another of cauliflower, so I can just grab a couple crowns when I'm preparing a meal. * I dice an onion, so I can have onion in something I want to cook or eat. A tablespoon of sauteed onions in scrambled eggs, for example, are incredible. * I bake 4 split chicken breasts, skin on, then cube it up into 1" cubes, and put it in a container in the fridge. * I drink on average about 2 protein drinks a day. * I boil a dozen eggs and peel them, and put them in a container in the fridge. * I have low carb prepared options, like sauerkraut, olives, cherry tomatoes, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses, quality beef sticks and jerky strips. The next thing you will need to do is keep a food log. That which gets measured gets managed. If you don't keep a food log, you are just kind of winging it. You need the accountability and rigor regular food logging provides. I created a google spreadsheet that I use to document my meals and get all the macros (carbs, protein, fat, calories) in one place, then, when I prepare and eat a meal, it's super convenient to log it correctly. With this strategy, I have been able to lose 97 lbs since the beginning of the year, and all of my medical tests are coming back in the normal range now. I still need to lose 30-40 lbs to be comfortably within the healthy BMI category. But I'm no longer obese. A delicious, quick meal I have been loving over the last few weeks is to cut small sweet peppers in half length wise, then stuff the little pepper canoe with chicken salad, or artichoke &amp; spinach dip, or hummus + capers + olives, or palmetto cheese. With this, if I plan my meals out for the week and hit every target (and any longer, the miss is in under-eating, not over-eating) then I'll eat about 1,650 calories a day. If I miss my target, it's usually because I skipped lunch or didn't eat all of my lunch.
10. u/PinnatelyCompounded [score=2, created=2025-11-10T17:20:41]: The best thing you can do is get in the habit of reading nutrition labels. Read the serving size, carbs, protein, and fat. Your partner will eventually need to balance their carb intake with insulin or follow a meal plan that limits carbs. Lower carb is always easier on diabetics (for me, Type 1, that would mean &lt;45 g of carbs per meal), but getting a good distribution of fat and protein is also helpful because those slow blood glucose from rising quickly. You can try things with sugar substitutes, but be forewarned that tons of diabetics (myself included) hate them because those chemicals cause stomachaches and they’re not worth the pain.
11. u/azwildlotus [score=-4, created=2025-11-09T23:53:19]: I’d suggest asking this question in the prediabetes sub.
