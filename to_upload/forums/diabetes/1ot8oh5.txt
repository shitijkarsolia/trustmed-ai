===============================================================================

I’ve been looking for some Christmas gift for diabetics but haven’t really found something. I would like to know if you guys have some suggestions/ideas :) Preferably not over 100€/120€ EDIT: it is for my niece, she’s a 14 yr old girl who has been living with diabetes for 5 years now.

2. u/Kodeake [score=11, created=2025-11-10T09:52:18]: Um. Something related to their hobbies or interests? Like any other normal person? You say she's been diabetic for 5 years. I promise she has all the equipment she wants/needs. Why do you want to get her something for her diabetes? Just don't buy her, like, a Terry's chocolate orange or something and you're fine....
3. u/AnotherLolAnon [score=3, created=2025-11-10T04:57:47]: Are you looking for things to request for Christmas? Or things to give someone else? This would highly depend on how they're treating their diabetes and where they're at in their journey and how old they are. Most adults who have been living with diabetes for a bit have what they need or want and are comfortable with their current equipment. I personally wouldn't want most things related to diabetes as a gift. That said- fun cgm patches? Nice supply case (if needed)? I know a lot of people have wanted the type 1 barbie.

5. u/Rockitnonstop [score=2, created=2025-11-10T12:54:02]: Art supplies, favourite band records/cassettes, cool clothes (I was a gothy kid that appreciated anything black), books, and craft stuff. Basically anything I could distract myself with from my diabetes.
6. u/Ladder-Necessary [score=1, created=2025-11-10T05:10:51]: Depends on your/that person's goals. For me - exercise related equipment (running shoes, strength bands), gift cards to a climbing gym or some sort of HIIT or yoga classes, gift cards to a local keto bakery, fun flavors of nuts, would all be welcome. But that varies hugely person to person. Some things, like a diabetic cookbook, or sugar free candy that is still high carb, are things that seem diabetic friendly, but I actually would not want.

There are purses/cases for carrying diabetes equipment, There are clothing items with pockets to hide an insulin pump in, there are dolls with CGMs and pumps, there are decorative stickers to go on her devices, or there is at least one company that will send a gift box of assorted items. The choices are endless! So, if you can clue us into what she would like, we can direct you to the appropriate websites.
12. u/Ok-Tumbleweed-7378 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T05:35:05]: What about a medical carrying case? I have a hard back case that fits my insulin, meter, and all of my supplies to change my insulin pump. Its bigger than standard insulin supply cases, but it not too cumbersome to carry. Its like the size of a small purse. You can get them as soft cases or hard cases. My case comes with a combination lock for safety. I carry it everywhere.
