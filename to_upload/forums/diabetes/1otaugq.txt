===============================================================================

I was diagnosed about a week ago after DKA. I was not given medication on the way out of the hospital but I'm supposed to track my blood sugar numbers until I see the doctor on Tuesday. Food is not possible until at least Tuesday due to snap crisis, cannot get to a food bank, cannot find any that deliver. Have eaten three times Friday and already suffering. How do I: Control the side effects Make sure it doesn't affect the numbers being given to choose my medicine (Perhaps impossible) Mostly I just want to make sure everything goes smoothly and I figured I'm not the only one in this food situation :(
