I have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I am having a hard time adjusting to managing my blood sugar as someone who works night shift. Does anyone have any advice on when I should take my long acting insulin on the days I work? Or how to not starve throughout the night when I’m working. I’ve been told that intermittent fasting could be an option where I don’t eat past 12 but it’s tricky to plan that as I work at a hospital and breaks aren’t always going to be when you want it unfortunately.

But unfortunately it didn’t work too well for me. I kept feeling sick. I had to switch to days and I have a rule now that I’ll never work a night shift job. I know thats not helpful. But I know it can be really challenging.
