===============================================================================

I (20F) just got put onto 2.5mg of Mounjaro and the doctor told me he’d up my dose in 4 weeks. He said it’s great for weight loss and lowering A1C. He wants me to loose abt 20lbs. I know it curves your appetite but has anybody successfully built muscle on Mounjaro? I know protein goal is big with building muscle. I don’t need to be “shredded” but I want to take my health a little more seriously and begin working out again, and one of my main goals is to build some muscle. Also, I’m not necessarily nervous to take Mounjaro, but I just want to know has anybody had any side effects ? For reference I’m 4”11, 140lbs

I go to the gym 4 days a week and concentrate on weight machines rather than cardio. I am now on Mounjaro 5.0 but still losing (albeit very slowly. ) BTW, I am 83 years old and got T1D after immunotherapy for stage 4 metastatic malignant melanoma. It got the cancer but also my pancreas. Not a bad tradeoff I guess. I use Omnipod and G7 to manage and they are a godsend. I have Medicare and Blue Cross/Blue shield. They pay 100% once I am in the donut hole. YRMV JON

I eat a crap ton of fiber and protein, and I have to get enough hydration and rest. I keep my calories and carbs in check too. I took a month or so to get my diet until control and then moved to the gym. First it was adding in cardio and then slowly building that habit with weight lifting too. Now I'm definitely building muscle, even on 10 mg. Don't worry about getting shredded. You won't. As you build muscle and lose fat, more muscles will show through. Like right now, my quads like amazing. But that's a fire cry from shredded. It takes a heck of a lot of work to get to that point, and you're not going to look unnatural. Trust me on this - it's going to take a few more levels of effort to reach even close to that. You're not going to start lifting and in a few months suddenly look like a body builder, if you catch my drift. **And** because you have the health-first mindset, you don't have the same rush to the finish line. You can take your time and focus on you. It's a nice little bonus that you're getting your diabetes under control, your weight until control, your mental health under control, your diet until control, and finding a new love for exercise that you never knew existed.

The weight is slowly going down and im really very surprised how well my BG is kept in check. Overall, very happy with how well its working. I had the occasional exhaustion day after initial dose and going from 2.5mg to 5.0mg. I have a Libre2, and would recommend anyone whose insurance allows, to get a CGM. glhf

6. u/Ok_Raspberry_5655 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T15:17:01]: I lost a bunch of muscle due to rapid weight loss on Mounjaro. I have been exercising and eating more protein to get back on track. Find out from your doctor how much protein you need each day so you can make sure the limited amount of food you will feel like eating will help your muscles.

That was because of what I was cooking for him. Honestly it pissed me off that he decided to prescribe him this instead of telling him to work out. I’ve worked with Doctors before &amp; I know they get a cut for prescribing medications. They get visited on a monthly basis with drug reps to discuss their numbers &amp; give them (sometimes office staff too) lunch. Please read into side effects.
8. u/Gradstudenthacking [score=1, created=2025-11-13T17:23:11]: I have been on it for about a year, dropped 80 pounds give or take. Did lose muscle but mostly due to not being able to work out most of the year (3 broken ribs, blacking out spells caused by untreated asthma and tendinitis in my shoulder caused by the broken ribs). I’m finally getting to a point where I think I can work out again. Make sure you get plenty of protein and fiber in your diet. I personally like Jocko Molk for protein shakes, taste is great not gritty and sweeter is monk fruit so no sugar spike. Perfect for a diabetic. As long as you get enough protein you shouldn’t lose muscle (the muscle loss is largely caused but not enough protein in your diet and limited meal sizes). Personally I love the med and its downsides are pretty minimal for me.
9. u/Dorfdad [score=0, created=2025-11-10T09:55:48]: I’m on Manjaro as well was on ozempic for about 2 years. Only problem with ozempic for me was stomach issues from digestive slowdown. Switched to Manjaro currently in 5ml and my stomach issues have gone away. Just need more fiber! Yes you can gain muscle on gb1 it’s just a little harder eat more protein, get good rest. Only downside is I went from 235 to 185 on ozempic and since switching I’m at 201 now I can’t lose weight on Manjaro even though they say it’s better! /smh
