===============================================================================

Long story short, about 9 months ago I was diagnosed with T2 and my A1C at that time was 7.9, my last check was 2 months ago and it was 11.3. I have been monitoring my glucose multiple times daily the last 2 months along with making smarter choices (low carbs, no sugars, etc) and my highest glucose reading was 184 (after pizza) with all other readings being at or below 130. My next A1C check is about a month away. Is it safe to assume that with 3 months of good readings that my A1C will be lower than my previous reading since all my glucose checks have been in range? Or is that not how it works? This is all still new to me, but I'm trying to do this the right way.

My bloodwork is done every 3 months and I believe that is the standard.

With immediate diet changes, no pizza, and a bit of excerise. I dropped it to 9.8 in 30 days. Got serious about the excerise after that. 3 months later. No insulin anymore and a 5.2 a1c. I have been able to maintain that the last 2 a1c tests.
