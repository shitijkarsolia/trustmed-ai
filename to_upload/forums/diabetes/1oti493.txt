===============================================================================

My wife has type 1 diabetes and I work for the federal government. We were planning on switching to NALC HIGH during this open season but when I went to go check this morning it says they removed it from our options. I am trying to research these other plans and would appreciate any input on BCBS basic GEHA standard and UHC primary plus. Or if there are any better plans please let me know.
