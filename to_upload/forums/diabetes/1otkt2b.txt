===============================================================================

Hey guys. Just doing an intro post. I’m Rick and I found out yesterday I’m diabetic. Lately I’ve had nagging headaches that won’t go away (which I attributed to my migraines), a bit of light headedness, and some nausea. What I didn’t really consider was an almost insatiable thirst and peeing all the time. I finally felt bad enough yesterday to do a test on my wife’s meter and it read 22 nmols. Repeated 30 minutes later and it wasn’t much better. A nurse friend who is type 1 said I’d best go to the ER. There I tested 25.4. Long story short they did blood work and my A1C is 12. The er doc started me on Metformin- 1/2 a tablet 2x a day then 2 tablets twice a day after 7 days. Not the news I was expecting and I’m pretty down about it to be honest. I don’t have many hobbies and I get most of my enjoyment from food. I’m not enormous but I am a bigger guy at 280@5’11. Anyway, just thought I’d say hey and I enjoy what I’ve read so far!

2. u/Wisewolverine [score=4, created=2025-11-10T12:09:37]: Sounds similar to how I found out. A1C was 11.6. 3 months later I am at 6.2 after getting on Mounjaro and Metformin. Gastric issues are there for sure, but getting better as I adjust. It gets better man. Getting a CGM really helped me to manage my diet.
3. u/erikpeders [score=3, created=2025-11-10T12:05:42]: I was diagnosed back in April, A1C was 11.5. My first follow up blood test it was down to 5.8. It doesn't have to be as awful as it can seem. Learn to cook if you don't already. Figure out alternatives. Peanut butter and whipped cream helped me kick ice cream. Realize you can allow yourself treats every now and then once you figure it out. You got this.

As for food, yes it will change, but you will see we get used to everything and you will create a new scale of values. If you liked cooking “good” food you will find pleasure again but within new rules of value: we get used to it. Good luck to you

6. u/kilamumster [score=1, created=2025-11-10T14:49:15]: Congrats! Er.. I mean, welcome! Test frequently until you get a sense of what your body is doing when you eat or exercise. My SO and I went thru the wild ride till everything pretty much got under control and well managed. Take care!
