Cliff notes of my journey: 7 years ago, I was told I’m diabetic during an ER visit for an appendectomy. BS: 655; A1C: 14.7. 25YO male at diagnosis. Followed up with a PCP who didn’t care and just told me to take Metformin. No other testing done. Said T2 because I was overweight and younger. PCP retired and new PCP took over. I brought up my concerns and some slight medication adjustments were made. Finally put on a CGM. No other major changes. Lantus, glipizide, sitagliptin. This PCP said I could be a T1.5 but we never did any other forms of testing. I’ve never taken it super serious, just took the meds and lived my life. A1C last checked at 6.7. PCP says good enough. She basically matches my energy of indifference. Last few months, I’ve decided to be serious about this finally. I’m diabetic and I need to take charge of it. So at this point, I’m needing some suggestions. What tests need to be done to have an actual diagnosis: T2, LADA, or MODY? What should I ask about medications? I want less medications and I’m happy to work out daily. I’ve started to transition to a Mediterranean type diet and am happy with those changes. Currently, when I try to work out my BS tanks and I’m scared of pushing further so I will stop. I’m not sure how I can improve physically if I can’t work out. I used to be an active, outdoor physical guy before the diagnosis. Thanks to everyone for any words of wisdom! Edit: I am in the overweight category. I know weight loss is heavily diet influenced but I also would like to be able to work out daily. Currently, if I even walk at a medium pace for more than 15 minutes, my BS will drop by 75-100. It’s wild and scary feeling. Update: thanks for all the advice from people. I’m working on getting an Endocrinologist ASAP. This whole experience was prompted when I realized I can’t even answer what type of diabetic I am. I’m probably type 2 but no doctor/endo has ever defined it for me. I’ll look into all the advice and get in to an Endocrinologist!

2. u/K89_ [score=7, created=2025-11-10T16:06:30]: You need to see an endocrinologist, instead of just the PCP. They will fully test you to see what type of diabetes etc. and the best treatment
3. u/TheNerdBiker [score=4, created=2025-11-10T16:29:11]: Seeing an Endocrinologist really changed my course of Type II diabetes. Education. Proper treatment…I’m at non diabetic levels with A1C.
4. u/LogicalEstimate2135 [score=6, created=2025-11-10T12:20:53]: Test for the following antibodies to see if you’re type 1: insulin autoantibodies (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), IA-2 autoantibodies (IA-2A), zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A), and islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA)

6. u/Medium_Nectarine_857 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T02:18:49]: Um, if you take Lantus for basal insulin but nothing for bolus insulin (when eating carbs and correcting high BS), that’s super weird. If you crash after a workout, that’s usually type1. I don’t believe in type 1.5. Either your pancreas produces insulin, or it doesn’t. But CGMs and basal insulin are usually for type 1 ((which I am). The majority of type 2 ppl can theoretically cure themselves of type 2 diabetes. Not all, but most (some tyoe2 cases are hereditary). Your DIABETES DOCTOR (not primary), which could be an endo, will advise on tests. But if your pancreas produces insulin, you can kick diabetes by doing 4 things. The first is changing your lifestyle. Meaning you need a full overhaul of your mindset so you make the same right decisions 95% of the time. Meaning COMMITMENT AND CONSISTENCY with the goal being to eventually get off ALL DRUGS and CGM. There are books about people curing their type 2 diabetes so feel free to read/confirm this is true. 2 of these are kind of subsidiaries of the first 1: diet and exercise. This is where a lot of tyoe2 ppl give up, mostly because they already have a lifestyle of eating bad and not exercising to begin with, which caused them to become diabetic. Veggies and low carbs are a necessity. Make a limit of X amount of carbs per meal. Cutting out bread and pasta is probably a requirement. Regular soda and regular juice is a NEVER. Anything that will spike your glycemic index is a NEVER unless you’re low. On the days you workout, you can eventually take less lantus and also once you establish a pattern you can take carbs during the workout to keep you level. If you’re still crashing, make sure you pair whatever carb you have with protein. BUT YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR CARDIO DAILY. This might just be walking to start, but no skipping days. The last thing is regulate stress and positivity. These are underrated but vital. My immune system attacked my pancreas because I was the most stressed out I’ve ever been, and that’s what caused me to become diabetic. My immune system was trying to protect me….. from me. So make sure you limit stress and stay positive. Usually I’d troll ppl who don’t take this condition seriously who post their problems on Reddit but i see you at least are working on trying to better yourself. Don’t give up, stay strong

You didn't disclose your weight.. If you're overweight it means you have plenty of insulin around whilst if you're skinny that's a sign of lack of it. If you're on medication it would affect your BG when working out. If you have decided to live a more active lifestyle your medications should reflect that. If you are 100% into this new more active you, and considering your recent HbA1c, you could drop all meds and just keep metformin (it doesn't cause hypos).. Obviously you need to talk to your doc and inform them of your intentions. Usually at diagnosis you'd have a couple of HbA1c tests 3/6 months apart.. An OTT test and possibly a c-peptide test for T1. I think you past that stage as if you were T1 or 1.5 in seven years you would definitely have found out 😉
8. u/LarryMahnken [score=3, created=2025-11-10T12:10:41]: You're probably diabetic, but you might be anemic or have a thyroid, kidney or liver condition, maybe something else. If you don't trust your doctor, find a new doctor. It's the only way you're going to get an answer that will help you live a better life.
9. u/noodle-face [score=1, created=2025-11-10T18:57:48]: 650 blood glucose with almost 15a1c and now a 6.7 means you're definitely diabetic. I agree with others, see an endo.
10. u/breebop83 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T21:00:05]: I agree with others saying to find an endo. I would suggest bring up the exercise issue with the endo when you get one. *I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice*. Your a1c is in a decent place right now. It could be lower and will likely get there as you are able to exercise more freely. That being said, even with the drops during workouts you may not want to adjust meds until you speak with an endo. You aren’t on fast acting insulin so any adjustments may solve the exercise drop but you could end up running higher at other points during the day. For the time being, you might try sipping on some full sugar Gatorade/powerade/whathaveyou during your workout to mitigate the drop. Alternatively, you could have more carbs before working out to see if that keeps the drop during your workout more reasonable. A lot of dealing with diabetes is trial and error unfortunately, there are very few universal truths that work for every person every time. While working out, make sure you have fast sugar available to avoid true lows (under 70) and you can also tweak the low alarm on your CGM so it goes off at 80 or 90 which should give you some extra time to deal with any fast drops.
11. u/bryanindiana [score=1, created=2025-11-11T00:37:10]: I have a number of recommendations for you. First ask for pcp for a referral to an endocrinologist. Once you get that referral depending on the area you live and your insurance your first scheduled appointment with endo will likely be somewhere between two weeks and three months. While you are waiting to get in you need to do the following until you endocrinologist can give you specific guidance: eliminate sodas and drinks containing sugar or high fructose corn syrup. The high fructose corn syrup that is in foods and beverages is actually worse than natural sugar believe it or not. I recommend switching to teas with Splenda. Watch closely food labels that indicate the food contains high fructose corn syrup. If you’re not using a CGM you need to check your blood sugar levels four times a day. If you do have a CGM you should do a regular finger stick at least once a day to make sure your CGM is properly calibrated. Your endocrinologist might want to put you on a injectable drug like Ozempic as it can help you with both diabetic issues and with weight loss. The thing is that before you start such medication you need to first make adjustments to your eating habits as to reduce some of the side effects of the medication. Honestly though your endocrinologist will probably put you first on fast acting and slow acting insulin before trying something else. If he or she does not want to do insulins or Ozempic type drug for you can ask if you could take Janumet instead of just Metformin. Janumet actually contains two drugs sitagliptin and metformin. The combination of those two drugs typically helps your body better regulate your blood sugar levels. Now one important note both Ozempic and Junumet will require insurance preaproval and both are expensive especially if you have high copayments for Medicines. Also most insurance companies will only allow you to either take Ozempic or Junment not both because of costs. Your doctor should have been doing an A1C on you at least once if not twice a year. If you PCP was not doing that I recommend getting a new pcp after you see your new endo doctor first. Best wishes

13. u/Zeus783 [score=-3, created=2025-11-10T12:45:46]: Well HbA1c is a test and you've had a few throughout the years 😜 I see.. I missed the bit you're not in metformin right now.. And based on meds you're in I assume you're overweight? Which kind of rules out T1 🤔 Not sure which country you're in..having a second read of your posts I assume USA?.. As some countries you are asked to see an endocrinologist so I took that for granted.. But yea ideally you should find one.. And obviously a full panel of tests diabetes related would involve liver and pancreas. Someone mentioned tyroyde.. Not sure why...but it doesn't hurt having that checked too.. 👍 Anyways... Glad you're taking this seriously now 🙌
