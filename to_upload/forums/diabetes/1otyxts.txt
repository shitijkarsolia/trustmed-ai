===============================================================================

Just wanted to share some good news! I was diagnosed recently with an A1C of 7.4 it had slowly been climbing over the last year and my doctor basically gave me the “this is your last chance before needing medication” talk so I really buckled down and started paying attention to the foods I ate and took diabetes classes and joined this page! Happy to say I am down to 6.4 and feel great! Our goal was to get me to 6.9 just to show I can bring my A1C down and I got my results today! Proud of myself and now I’m not motivated and confident that I can take control!!
