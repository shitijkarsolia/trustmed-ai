===============================================================================

Is brain fog, concentration and memory issues common in T2 diabetes? My work involves lots of thinking and problem solving. I have noticed that my mind get blank or things just fly past my brain. I was pretty sharp before with lots of energy but now I feel sleepy all day. How can I fix this? This is really affecting my mental health.

Manage your blood sugar down and things do get back to normal. Loads of great diet advice on here, my advice is eat, starving yourself doesn't work. Diabetes.co.uk recommend less than 130grams carbs per day, aiming for slightly lower provides leeway. I use an app lose it to track nutrition, there are other apps this is not an ad. Fiber is carbs that don't convert to blood sugar. Avoid potatoes,rice, pasta, white bread. Vegetables are great - e.g. stir fry veg. Fish is great (baked fish is cheap). You may end up snacking on unhealthy stuff, but if you do work out how long it is until the next time you do, and the make the gap between the next time at least half as long again. It's amazing how you can break that habit, many of us got here through poor dietary choices and it takes time sometimes to retrain yourself. Diagnosis can be confusing and scary but you'll get there and you'll feel amazing when you do

Take prescribed medication regularly and within a week you'll see drastic improvement. Brain fog, concentration issues, frequent urination all are linked to high blood sugar. Make changes in your diet. Keep yourself hydrated. As my own work involves a lot problem solving too, I can relate totally. I passed out during a critical online meeting and they kept calling my name! That's when I got diagnosed
3. u/kbwe1 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T00:17:02]: It could be a b12 and/or folic acid issue, so certainly contact the GP and ask for those to be tested. If applicable it could be perimenopause or menopause. I was also told that when I’d just changed my diet, because it was so dramatic, my body was adjusting to new lower sugar levels and that can have slightly odd side effects for a short amount of time. But please speak to your doctor or nurse.
4. u/Wooptay [score=1, created=2025-11-11T00:52:16]: Yes, unregulated blood glucose can definitely cause brain fog and concentration issues. However if you get it under control and keep it controlled, you will return to normal. It's unlikely it has caused any long term problems unless you've been ignoring the problem for years and years, but it might still take a few weeks of regulated blood glucose to get back to your base level. Even when your BG is generally well controlled though, blood glucose spikes can / will cause these symptoms, although they are usually short lived (as in, until you get back down to a normal range).

Any tingling in toes or pinkies are related to this as well - it's how diabetes causes nerve damage. (Also take magnesium, vitamin D supplements) So yes absolutely. And you may think you're depressed when it's been chronic blood sugar issues
