Hi! I have type 1 diabetes, and I’m passionate about cycling and running. Through my journey, I’ve learned a lot about managing diabetes during training and races, and I love sharing tips and advice on how to stay healthy, safe, and perform at your best. My goal is to show that having diabetes doesn’t have to hold you back. Whether you’re struggling to manage your blood sugar during workouts or just looking for motivation, I hope my experiences can inspire you to push your limits and feel more confident in handling your diabetes every day. Follow my journey and workouts on Strava? My name there is **Ansgar ￼Sommerfeldt | T1D | Everesting | Norway 🇳🇴**

Mind sharing a quick rundown? • What was happening around those boluses (pre-ride meal, mid-ride correction, post-ride refuel)? • Pump or MDI? If pump, did you use temp basal/override? If MDI, any basal tweaks on heavy training days? • Which insulins are you on (basal + rapid), and do you change your ICR/ISF for long rides or races? • Pre-ride routine: timing of pre-bolus, grams of carbs, and how much fat/protein you keep in the meal. • During-ride fueling: roughly how many carbs per hour, and do you “micro-bolus” for steady drip carbs vs. bigger hits (gels/chews)? • Race-day differences vs. training (adrenaline spikes, warm-up strategy, first 30–45 minutes)? • CGM alert thresholds you use on the bike/run, and your go-to hypo rescue plan that doesn’t boomerang you high. • Post-ride: recovery carbs/protein and whether you do a reduced correction or delayed bolus to dodge late crashes. Would love to learn how you’ve dialed this in—what’s worked, what hasn’t, and any “never again” lessons. Keep crushing it. 🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️💪
2. u/TheHitcher95 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T04:49:47]: Fantastic stuff man! I've recently turned 30 and started my journey improving fitness, I'm working towards a 10km run I've signed up for early next year but have already had a minor scare with low bgl mid-run (only 5km so not too far from home luckily). That made me realise I need to have a better plan for longer runs. Any advice on things you eat before/things you carry with you during to help control sugar levels? Definitely hoping to keep pushing after the 10km so any advice would be appreciated.
