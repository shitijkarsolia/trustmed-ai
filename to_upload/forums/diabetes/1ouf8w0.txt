===============================================================================

Guys and gals, firstly I’m sorry if I’m not allowed to post here. I do not have diabetes. However, I watched my grandfather slowly die at what I consider to be a young age (62) of complications from diabetes. I am currently 27, about to turn 28. I hit a phase for the last couple years where I just didn’t care about anything. Didn’t care about my health and taking care of myself or making decisions that will prove fruitful in the future. I went through phases of getting a milkshake every other night, or eating a pint of ice cream every 2 days, and in love with sweets. Just eating trash like a true American piece of garbage. Also, I know diabetes has an effect on the feet, and I’ve always been cognizant of a weird feeling in my feet, almost numb and cold at weird times. I am uneducated when it comes to this, as you can tell. I went the doc the other day and my hemoglobin A1c returned at 5.1, to my surprise. I kinda just figured I was diabetic, or at the very least, pre, because of my terrible dietary habits and my hereditary disposition. Part of the worry worm in me wonders if there’s a particular circumstance that may be manipulating the results, but I’ll believe them. Again, sorry if I’m not allowed to post here. But I’m just wondering how I can protect myself now to make sure that I can live a full life of health. If anyone has any advice or insight on how to take care of myself moving forward, would be awesome. Always curious to learn. Thank you

It’s a lot harder to change bad eating and exercising habits when you *have* to. Make the changes now. Cut the quantity of carbs, sugars, fried foods you’re eating, so if you do end up with a diagnosis, you have a good place to start. Walk every day. It doesn’t hurt to take preventative measures if you know you’re genetically predisposed.

You may not be able to prevent diabetes if you’re genetically predisposed, but it certainly can’t hurt to adjust your diet and lifestyle now.

If you feel that you are predisposed to diabetes because of your family history, it's good to stay on top of this. You may want to have your A1C rechecked on a regular basis, such as every 3 months or every 6 months, whatever your doctor recommends. Your doctor can make a diagnosis based on blood tests and possibly urine tests, your family history and any symptoms you might mention. Your A1C value is a key indicator in making the diagnosis. People diagnosed with diabetes need to watch their carbohydrate intake carefully and stay away from junk foods and foods with useless carbohydrates and little else in them. Diet, exercise, hydration, medications, sleep and stress management all can affect blood glucose levels, so all of these are important. Your doctor can provide you with a referral to see a dietician, if needed. Your insurance may pay for that visit if it is considered medically necessary. If you are diagnosed as pre-diabetic or diabetic, your doctor can give you a referral to see an endocrinologist. This is a specialist in endocrine systems, and diabetes falls under their area of soecialty. Afain, if your doctor provides the referral, your insurance will probably pay for that visit too.

You can also try a food coach app like Glucospike ai; it helps you see which meals actually spike blood sugar.

6. u/thesoapypharmacist [score=0, created=2025-11-11T12:44:51]: Besides the healthy behaviors others have said Annual checkup should in general find any changes, 6 months if you have been found to have blood pressure, cholesterol or prediabetic indications. Diabetic complications are overall caused by micro-damage to your tissues over time by being in the higher sugar (in general) state. It affects everything: circulatory system from heart to the small tissues in your feet, impedes your healing abilities from sores or illness, eyes and kidneys bc of the damage in small tissues. So if you don’t get checkups to know you have an issue, or don’t do what you need to do to get your sugar close to normal most of the time then complications are inevitable. It doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy cake once in a while. But you mostly have to be in control. When treating diabetes there are other medications that show decrease in health complications if also taken. For example you might not have cholesterol or blood pressure issues, but the Dr should put you on those meds also for tissue protection. Also it’s entirely possible that you can exercise enough and a pint of ice cream every other day doesn’t do damage at all. It’s about your overall health/exercise/ ability of your body to process what you put into it. At minimum 150 minutes a week of cardio for cardiovascular health. If you can add muscle with some weight exercises your metabolism will work better. If you in general follow the MyPlate for eating. There’s a lot of good science behind these recommendations.
