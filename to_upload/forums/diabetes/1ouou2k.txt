===============================================================================

I’ve been hungrier lately, and even though I do strength training Ive been putting on weight very rapidly. Not necessarily muscle or fat gain, my body is just getting bigger at a fast pace that my sizes are changing. How do you deal with that?

I'm also tracking my macros to make sure I have enough protein, fiber, carbs and fat for each meal and then for the day. When I have enough of each, I am rarely hungry between meals. I also cut out most processed foods and sugar (except for 1 - 3 tsp of maple syrup a day). I'm honestly surprised at how much volume I can eat and not gain weight.

8. u/FirebirdWriter [score=1, created=2025-11-11T16:59:39]: Yes but that's gone with the ozempic. It's not comfortable and I just want you to know that options may exist for you and you are not alone
