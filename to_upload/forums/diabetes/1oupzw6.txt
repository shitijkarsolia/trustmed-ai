I don't know if it is just me but there is nothing more annoying when I'm getting ready for bed and discover that I need to have a snack when my last finger poke of the day comes back below 5.0mmol. All I want to do is go to bed. I don't want to spend the time or energy figuring out what is quick and easy to make and won't send me too high but that also takes less then 20min to put together and eat. Tonight it was NSA chocolate pudding (which is about 10 carbs) and a piece of cheese. Probably wasn't enough bit it was all I had the energy for. Having a day off midweek has caused changes to my routine and made keeping my sugar from bottoming out a huge pain in the ass today. Well, off to bed.

2. u/Wooptay [score=7, created=2025-11-11T17:17:30]: Not unless I've already brushed my teeth. Then I'm pissed 😄
3. u/terraaus [score=3, created=2025-11-11T17:29:52]: Keep some snacks or candy in your nightstand table. Easy to reach last minute, or when you wake up in the middle of the night with low blood sugar.
4. u/cmhbob [score=3, created=2025-11-11T17:30:40]: Yeah, rage eating is a thing, especially when my Dexcom wakes me up at 0200 and I'm into the 60s (about 3.3 for you). Then I open up the peanut butter jar and pour a glass of milk. My go-to preventative snack these days is half a PB sandwich, which is about 17 or so carbs, depending on the bread.

6. u/gertymoon [score=2, created=2025-11-11T17:56:29]: I get this from time to time, I usually keep some cheese and cold cuts in the fridge and end up making a breadless sandwich by just taking the provolone and wrapping a piece of ham with it. Usually 2-3 of these will subdue my nightly cravings, it could be worse.
7. u/memesplease [score=2, created=2025-11-11T18:29:25]: Yeah, that can definitely be frustrating. In those moments, I usually try and laugh at the absurdity of the situation, like *damn it’s time for juice and cookies, why must I suffer*
8. u/Kaleandra [score=2, created=2025-11-12T00:33:01]: Every time I HAVE to eat something, it sucks. Worse when it’s after I brushed my teeth. Hope you’ll get into your new routine soon and this ends
9. u/EmbarrassedTea1885 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T20:15:37]: Ugh I woke up to my alarm going off last night at 2am. My sugars were 135 before bed too. I have roommates as well and felt so bad because they complain that it is loud but I cant help it. My sugars had dropped to 40. I keep orange juice (Tropicana in a cute little 8 oz carton like milk comes in) on my bed though just in case for a low and they are perfect to bring my sugars up but don't take them sky high either. And yes it is annoying cause I feel like sometimes eating before bed makes me crave bad things as well.
10. u/noodle-face [score=1, created=2025-11-13T08:04:44]: I get mad when I go low (happens a bit) and have to gorge on candy or something. When I get low I get irrational about serving size too.
