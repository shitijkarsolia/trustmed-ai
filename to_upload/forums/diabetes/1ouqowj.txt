Hi, I just wanted to ask some questions because I’m just starting to learn how to live my life with this condition and I have so many doubts. I’m 23 years old, I’m taking insulin before breakfast, lunch and dinner but my parents sometimes remind me because I forget to take it after I measure my glucose. Like I never forget that I have to do it but i dont completely internalized the habit and it scares me to put myself in danger for that (I found out being hospitalized for ketoacidosis). I wanted to know if you have some tips for remembering everyday, or just any advice in general. Thank you

I went through a long stage of denial and grief where I knew I needed insulin, but would refuse to take it. My a1c stayed around 9 for years, and I finally got it down to high 6-low 7. I hated every part about this disease(still do) and hated even wearing a pump/cgm. My biggest change that I made to adjust my overall health is to just take the time to as closely as possible guess my bolus and stop being afraid of taking too much. I was a big snack girl, and changing to 3 meals a day made a huge difference for me as well. I don’t know if you are on a pump yet, but it makes your life so much easier. If you forget a bolus, it will act as a last line of defense to bring your sugar back down. Instead of using a pen, you can deliver insulin through an app on your phone so it’s much more convenient. If you ever need someone to rant to or ask questions, I always love to talk and my dms are open!

I started using the Medications app on my iPhone (Health &gt; Browse &gt; Medications) to get timed notifications each day. I don’t allow myself to log a medication as “taken” until I’ve actually taken it (otherwise I’ll tell myself “I’ll take it in a few minutes,” then forget as often as not). It keeps me on track and honest, and it’s very easy to use. I think the suggestion of an insulin pump is a good one, too!

My partner got diagnosed just under 3 years ago and goes to Fleet Street Clinic (we actually go there for vaccines and check ups too) and they’ve been brilliant with helping him figure out routines. One thing that really helped him early on was linking insulin to something automatic like brushing teeth or setting a recurring phone reminder titled “INSULIN NOW” with an alarm tone you don’t ignore. Having a small travel pouch with your kit ready to go also helped him. Not sure if this is useful to u but wanted to share just incase x
