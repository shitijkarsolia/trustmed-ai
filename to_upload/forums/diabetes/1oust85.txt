===============================================================================

So I got 8.7 on 9th September and I checked it after 2 months on 10th Nov it came out 6.9. My doctor started metformin 500mg twice a day drom 13th September and I have lost 17.5lbs over the past 2 months, doing fairly regular exercise and following smart plate method. Is it just the medicine that did the magic? Should I ask my doctor to consider reducing my dose? I want to get off from medications eventually.

By this speed you will be off the meds very soon, just keep on maintaining your diet and doing exercise. You should be able to reduce the dosage once your HbA1c reaches 6-6.2 and eventually stop it once it stabilizes below 6, do consult your doctor before doing so!
