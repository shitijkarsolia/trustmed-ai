Like if I realize that my sugars are high and I am at a restaurant and need to inject insulin I feel like people who see me think I am a heroine addict or something lol. Does anybody else feel like this? Like if I am in town all day (I walk because I feel like it is better for my diabetes so I don't have a car to go to) and need insulin and there is no bathroom in sight. What do you guys do? I don't have a pump so I need to inject before every meal.

2. u/Trivius [score=57, created=2025-11-11T20:43:01]: My favourite moment with this was when my blood sugar was high and i needed to give a correction on a bus. My friend waited until i gave my injection, pats my shoulder sympathetically and says loudly "Don'r worry, we'll get ypu off of the methadone someday". The looks I got were hilariously horrified. In high school i was told by the school i had to inject somewhere other than the cafeteria because it was making students uncomfortable and i told them they were welcome to try and stop me but i would press charges if anyone tried to take my insulin or stop me

Now I just ask politely "Hey can you give me like a 5 minute heads up, I'm a diabetic and I need to take my insulin before I eat" Then I just turn to the side, roll up my shirt and bolus at the table. I'm hygienic, I take my sharps with me and I don't see any issue with it. I've yet to have a complaint.

5. u/GenghisCoen [score=12, created=2025-11-11T20:33:22]: Are your drawing insulin out of a bottle, with the same type of needle that's used for heroin? Or do you have a preloaded pen, with tiny little needle caps? I tried to be discreet when I was young and had syringes. After I switched to pens, it was so fast, and didn't look like "drugs" and I stopped caring what anyone thought.
6. u/gracecee [score=7, created=2025-11-11T22:01:22]: No. I’d rather not die.
7. u/friendless2 [score=10, created=2025-11-11T21:27:28]: In 26 years, only 1 stranger has noticed me taking a shot that I am aware of, and he was a T1 recommending a pump. My only T1 sighting. I just inject wherever I am, I don’t care.
8. u/Overratedmind [score=3, created=2025-11-11T21:20:25]: I used to care but now I don’t. It’s my health and at the end of the day I can die if I don’t inject. I’m sure some people have seen me roll over and do it but no one has said a thing.
9. u/Thesurvivor16 [score=5, created=2025-11-12T01:47:13]: Not at all. I have my insulin pen right there and just pop it in right at the table. Doesn’t bother me at all.
10. u/henare [score=8, created=2025-11-11T22:13:11]: I once tried to keep injecting to restroom settings but now I don't. restrooms (well, men's restrooms) are gross af and I wasn't doing anything wrong. now. I just do it where I am. (a guy I once dated asked what I was doing with my hands under the table... "taking my drugs, dude!") nobody has ever said anything, and if they did I'd probably cut them down.
