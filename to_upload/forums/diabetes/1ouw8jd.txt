===============================================================================

Found out my A1c over four months went from 7.4 to 6 without me using any diabetic medicine or insulin. I then celebrated this after doing my morning exercise by eating a double cheeseburger at Wendys (extra veggies), two beef and cheddar at Arby's (add veggies, subtract the bun of one sandwich), the ribs appetizer at Texas Roadhouse (salad instead of fries) two cocktails, and had a big wedge of Whole Foods chocolate fudge cake along with half a pint of Hershey's vanilla ice cream. Boy it was really fun. I could do it again tomorrow. What are the chances I'll be back in the danger zone in three months? I've missed eating. 😰

You can have bad days, but whatever you did to avoid medication and lower your a1c, get used to it because it's what you'll need to do for the rest of your life. That's why it pisses me off so much when people say that it's the "good" type of diabetes. It's not. None of them are. Management takes complete dedication. There is no such thing as reversal of diabetes, only remission, which is also rare and difficult. The longer you go with high blood sugars, the more damage is done to your pancreas and eventually, it doesn't come back from that and you'll require insulin. Long story short: Getting your a1c down to 6 is incredible. You should be proud of yourself. Keeping it there will take a lot of work. There is no magic cure, no quick fix, etc. The fad diets are not sustainable. It's not impossible. You will have times when you slip up. But as long as you continue working on your health, you'll be okay. You need to prioritize your health. If you want to have a burger, have it, but pair it with a walk after you eat it. If you want ice cream, eat it, but add some protein beforehand and a short walk. This has to be your priority. A1c and time in range numbers don't lie.

4. u/Wendimere66 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T11:54:20]: Why would you consciously do that to yourself (serious question). Diabetes is no joke.
5. u/yomatc [score=2, created=2025-11-12T06:56:40]: If you go back to old habits, it will go right back up. Assuming you’re type 2, you can probably get away with a dessert like that once a month, but I wouldn’t push it. The carbs from the cake are a bigger concern than the overall calories in a day like that. When I been to binge/cheat, I usually go high calorie, but try to keep carbs in check.
6. u/LastKnownGoodProfile [score=1, created=2025-11-12T05:06:03]: So do you now how many carbs, protein, fiber, fat, and calories that binge was? How far off your typical 6A1c meal was it? Chance has nothing to do with what your next A1C is.
