===============================================================================

my wife saw i had chronic kidney disease, base on blood test result. She puts me on low potassium diet. At first sounds good. But the blood sugar was in the 200. Today, I had a good dinner and ate a lot of tomatoes, high in potassium. Blood sugar was 138.

Diabetes makes everything more complicated; cheers to your wife for getting into it!

My spouse and my Endo are on a first name basis, she's had several kids since I started seeing her

So you should really talk to a doctor first if you need to be on a low potassium diet, and if so what you can do to work with your blood sugar.
