===============================================================================

So the past 4 years has been a roller coaster. Found out I was a type 2 diabetic (diagnosed by my general doctor) and it took a very long time to get me into an Endocrinologist. There was a 1 year wait list on my families endo and it wasn’t until about 2 years after my original diagnosis that I found out I’m actually a type 1. I’ve been on the Omnipod since January and it’s been good and bad. Ignoring the good for right now I’m having a huge problem with my pumps falling off mainly at night while I’m sleeping but occasionally at work as well. I’m a mechanic so a times I can get sweaty but I’m also constantly getting up, down, in, out and all around so occasionally it gets caught on something and falls off too. I’ve just got some over patches for them and I’ve had 2 fall off at night and once at work. We even have an ac unit in our room to prevent me from getting too hot at night. I just feel stuck especially since the it feels like I’m having constant problems and I’m out of solutions.

Do you use alcohol wipes to clean the area you are applying the omnipod to before applying it, and do you shave any hair off first? These can help with adhesion. There are also things like Skin Tac that can help keep the omnipod on.
