===============================================================================

Hi everyone, I've been type 1 diabetic for 16 years and I used the 640g pump with guardian sensor for a long time. The pump was fine but the sensor was so bad it was not usable. 5 years ago I switched to omnipod dash and dexcom g6 and it was great. Now my doctor wants me to switch to 780g. I'm excited about the new pump but that means I would need to use the guardian again. Last time I had guardian sensor it lost connection all the time and often gave inaccurate readings. It is also really difficult to put on by yourself. I have grown from a teenager to a young adult in the time I have used dexcom so I'm hoping the guardian will work better for me now. I would really appreciate your experiences and possible tips living with the guardian sensor. I'm also a swimmer so would like to hear about swimming with the guardian. (Also, I would switch to the guardian 4 but I have previously used an older model.)

I have a 770g now, which has been discontinued. I need an upgrade. Just hoping that when I upgrade I can get back on the sensor for better control. Im not a swimmer, but it has a tight seal and is water resistant. I think you should be ok as long as you dont stay in the water too long. But Im no expert. Definitely ask Medtronic.
