===============================================================================

i mean, its improved my sugars like amazingly. even looking at a plate of rice would spike them high into the 20s, but now i could probably eat an entire pack of pure sweets and it'd barely kiss them, its amazing. but its also just stopping me from eating, which i don't think is a very good thing. i already struggled to remembered to eat before (adhd goes brrr) and i'd rely on hungry tummy doing what hungry tummys do, but i no longer get the feeling anymore, and i don't know how to remedy that. its not a case of "oh, just set times to eat food" either, since the other thing is that i still feel full from whatever meal i ate before. its 12.30am on a thursday, yet i still feel full from when i ate at 7.30pm on tuesday, and trying to force myself to eat a meal is near impossible because i'm just not wanting food. at most i can eat a small snack (which is what i had been doing today) i just wanted to ask if anyone else is having this same sorta thing with mounjaro and if they have any tips of solutions to remedy such a thing

My neighbor is also on it and she was hospitalized for malnourishment. She had other stuff going on as well so I don't want to give the impression it was just the Mounjaro. But hearing about it made me want to add a multvitamin.

I'll eat then and end up feeling worse so its a damned if I do damned if I don't. Sometimes even smelling and looking at food makes me gag so its generally a very disturbing experience eating to live instead of living to eat quick onset. Just going to take it day by day Saturday marks week 4 shot.

Just my experience.* Taking it weekly was hard on me too so I asked care team if I could space the doses further apart. It gives me extra days to catch up on average calories and still good for glucose control (just a little under the performance of the weekly dose). I sort of get hunger pangs (stomach) after day 7. On my next appointment I'm going to see if smaller, weekly doses might be an option for me.

In the meantime, you can try drinking some of your calories (protein shakes, smoothies, etc.). If you’ve been on it a while, maybe drop down to a lower dose and see how that impacts both your glucose and appetite.
6. u/coffeecatsandtea [score=2, created=2025-11-13T01:43:22]: I'm on Trulicity and it has the same effect; I only eat because I have to take Metformin with food, so at least there's that? At the beginning of the week when the effects are strongest, I have a protein shake as my morning meal, or a Soylent drink. Make sure you're getting enough fiber as well - with the reduced hunger/smaller portions, I wasn't getting enough fiber when I started and it messed with my regularity. GLP-1s will slow the whole digestive system, so it takes longer to process meals even if the portions are smaller. Psyllium husk pills/Metamucil and or a probiotic soda like poppi or olipop will be your friends.

8. u/Prof1959 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T18:19:42]: You don't need a solution. Curbing appetite and reducing insulin resistance are it's only jobs. If it makes you feel any better, you will return to near-normal hunger towards the end of the week before you take it again.
9. u/VolCata [score=1, created=2025-11-13T06:01:02]: I'm on Wegovy and I absolutely don't feel hungry a lot of the time. But I've realised not to leave it until the point where I DO get hungry because then I'll act stupid (ish). The tip is to eat small meals and often throughout your day. I know it can be difficult to make yourself eat when you don't want to.
10. u/xx_maknz [score=1, created=2025-11-13T07:01:36]: Might be time to look into nutrition beverages during this time. The kind that contain several vitamins and minerals so you’re getting what you need in the meantime. I’d suggest ensure or boost, or really any supplement shakes you can tolerate. If you’re not a creamy shake person, ensure makes supplement drinks that are like juice - they’re called ensure clear and they come in a few different flavors, but the mixed fruit and blueberry pomegranate are available on amazon. They make an apple one (my personal fav) which isn’t on there sadly. Boost also apparently makes a clear shake called boost breeze!
11. u/vidavixxen [score=1, created=2025-11-13T07:35:19]: i find im eating far less than i normally do the first few days after the weekly shot, so i’ve been eating more on the days i feel good which are usually the last three
12. u/Eeyore_ [score=1, created=2025-11-13T14:18:25]: How long have you been on Mounjaro? How long have you been experiencing this multi-day feeling full? If you've been on it long and lost significant weight and are looking to go into maintenance, your doctor may need to decrease your dosage.
