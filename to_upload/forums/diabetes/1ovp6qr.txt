===============================================================================

My blood sugar is fine. I always drink water. I don’t breathe through my mouth. I always brush my teeth thoroughly twice a day. But it’s always like this. I don’t even know why. I asked my parents they said it might have something to do with diabetes. And other than the diabetes I don’t have any other medical conditions. &lt;=\^(
