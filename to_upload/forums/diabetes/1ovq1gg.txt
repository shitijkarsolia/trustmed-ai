===============================================================================

For some reason, it’s cereal for me. I can eat almost any dessert as long as my blood sugar is okay and I bolus insulin, but cereal is always off limits. I was hospitalized twice due to cereal X\^D but I’ve never been in the hospital ever again for diabetes since 2019 or 2020, so nearly 5 to 6 years. That was because I tried to cheat the system when I was 12/13 by eating small bowls of cereal and I thought I was so smart and could finally eat cereal again and then my BG went high and I had to go to the hospital anyway. So moral of the story: don’t cheat the system

2. u/Capable_Salt_SD [score=18, created=2025-11-12T20:11:22]: Mostly carb heavy stuff, which sucks cos I’m Asian and rice is a staple of our diets So I just end up eating other things, mainly small pieces of meat and cheese like a charcuterie board, or soup
3. u/DrJustinWHart [score=14, created=2025-11-12T20:09:18]: I'll get a spike with sweets that goes away. Too much bread has me up 10 points for days.
4. u/PayMeInSteak [score=13, created=2025-11-12T21:39:44]: It's pizza for me. Pizza ALWAYS send my sugars into the stratosphere no matter how I try to correct before hand.
5. u/July5 [score=9, created=2025-11-12T20:13:53]: White rice
6. u/FanDoggyGate [score=9, created=2025-11-12T21:56:20]: Pasta always gets me, no matter how much insulin or measuring or tricks I do, I'm going into the 200s for hours. Most foods I honestly don't have too many problems with outside of that.
7. u/MisanthropicScott [score=8, created=2025-11-12T20:13:52]: Fat slows down the digestion. Three out of four of those things have quite a bit of fat. One of those things is very starchy with nothing to slow down the absorption. Cereal is tricky! For cereal, whole milk may help, but will add calories from the fat. What really works for me though is that if my BG is above 100, I bolus in advance. Then, I wait until my sensor glucose reading just starts to dip before I start eating. But, don't forget to eat when it does! Watch it like a hawk or you risk going low. If I time it right, my sensor glucose bottoms out at about 75 - 80 mg/dL before starting to rise again. I haven't tried this with high sugar cereals. The two I alternate between have 4g and 5g of sugar per serving. Good luck!
8. u/thatdudefromoregon [score=4, created=2025-11-12T20:24:52]: Same, I miss it so much too. If I could only have one thing back in my diet that I've kicked out it would be random cereals. Fruit loops, cinemon toast crunch, I'd take fucking grape nuts or bran flakes if what was all I could have, I miss my cold crunchy breakfast.
9. u/Grisward [score=4, created=2025-11-12T22:08:30]: Apparently the local donut shop bear claws. Hahaha. Donut, seems to be fine. It’s a fixed number of carbs, pretty consistent. Bear claw is like a carb bomb (which is like a car bomb but for T1D). How many carbs? Nobody knows, and it just keeps hitting, haha. I have easier time with pizza or chinese food, tbh. Ah fun fun.
10. u/alli_shark [score=4, created=2025-11-12T22:26:01]: 100% cereal for me too. The “healthy” ones are the absolute worst! And of course cereal used to be one of my favorite treats. Haven’t had it in probably 5 or 6 years now.
