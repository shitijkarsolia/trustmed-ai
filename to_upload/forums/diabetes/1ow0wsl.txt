===============================================================================

It's been little under two weeks on Wegovy and I'm pleased to see a 4kg drop so far. Like yeah I imagine some of that will be water weight but it is nice to see anyway. Having gone on this medication, mostly to help with my blood sugar - I've seen my blood glucose drop from hovering around 11.5-14 mmol/L to between 7-9 mmol/L. Of course there's A LOT of room for improvement but hey. We are slowly getting there and will do as I lose more weight. Before Wegovy, I tried toying around with a very low calorie diet (VLCD) involving shakes and soups which wasn't all that helpful or successful tbh. Constipation and on/off fatigue aside, I've found the two weeks on this medication so much better. I do actually feel like I've more energy at times and much less run down than I did before. I'm also enjoying the gradual shift in all of those numbers!
