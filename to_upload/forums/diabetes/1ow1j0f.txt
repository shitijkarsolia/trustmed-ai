===============================================================================

What are your thoughts on which is better between these two? We have used dexcom ever since my kid has been diagnosed with type 1 so we don’t know how well the freestyle libre works. We might need to switch to libre because our insurance might only cover that one soon. Anyone out there who has used both do you have any positive thoughts on libre? Also what are the differences? Thanks

I felt that it was a little easier to insert. I liked the display of readings on the app more, as well. Each sensor also lasts 14 days. After using the Freestyle Libre 3 for a couple of months now, so far, I haven't had any issues with it.
