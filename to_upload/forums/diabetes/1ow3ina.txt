My dad's work is strict you should have no high blood sugar or else they will fire you (he works at the oil company) today he wanted to use the gym membership of his job and they tested his blood sugar it showed that he has diabetes we already knew his blood sugar was high but somehow he could hide it w not eating and stuff but it didn't work this time. we have no other income he has to work Did anyone ever used any tricks that can deceive the test? He has to give another test tomorrow if he has they will fire him Edit : he is a supervisor so he is not doing hard work where he climbs and fixes stuff so i don't think it's that dangerous I asked my dad just now he said that one of his responsibilities as a supervisor is being a lifeguard I don't live in America Okay Im a bit tired of replying I read it all and ik I'm not educated enough I apologize now ik but he still has to work bc he has no other option no one picks a 50 y old

Other than that, hiding or lying about a medical condition can be problematic. he needs to be checked by a real doctor.
2. u/10Core56 [score=18, created=2025-11-13T08:13:57]: While the legality of the testing at the gym and the firing might be suspect, actual treatment will help. At least look at the keto diet, for now. And be disciplined.
3. u/SearingPenny [score=7, created=2025-11-13T08:23:47]: Why is everyone commenting on the law without even knowing the location or if there are critical lives depending on his physical health that justifies it? It really goes beyond me.. Nevertheless, tell your dad to eat a big salad before any meal, cut liquid calories, alcohol, sugar en general. He can eat more protein, lower simple carbs and some moderate fat. Losing 10% or more of body weight will massively help. 30’ exercise (walking fast) will also help. He should also see a doctor and nutritionist. Good luck!

There is a limit to the amount you can hide it, and honestly, if he is medicated properly and has type 2, it will not be as noticeable. However, as it becomes more advanced, it will be harder and harder because the highs and lows will become more frequent and extreme, especially without medication., and also even with medication. I.e. as a type 1 diabetic, if i eat a bowl of cereal without insulin, my blood sugar will now be 18mmol/L. Even with insulin, i will still go higher for a period of time than a person without diabetes will. You can take insulin a head of time to reduce that spike (like 30 min to an hour), that might help a bit, but even with type 2 diabetes, he will eventually have those large spikes after eating. He needs to be seeing a doctor and getting medicated. there is no way around it. I know you asked not to talk about that, but it's impossible to hide diabetes as it progresses if they are testing his sugar.

6. u/igotzthesugah [score=3, created=2025-11-13T10:00:50]: If the blood test says he has diabetes he likely has diabetes. There’s no one day trick. If they’re doing an A1C it measures the last 90ish days.
7. u/amybpdx [score=2, created=2025-11-13T08:36:17]: He needs to see a doctor. He could put his and other people's lives at risk if he becomes debilitated on the job. There's a reason they're testing him... Put down the sodas, start drinking copious amounts of water, and make an appointment with a doctor ASAP.
8. u/psoriasaurus_rex [score=2, created=2025-11-13T09:24:39]: If he takes the test while fasting (not eating for at least 8 hours), it will probably be lower. But that will also depend on how bad his glucose control usually is. But even if he passes this test, he really needs to treat his diabetes. The problem is that his high glucose will damage his health over time and can lead to things like heart attack, stoke, kidney disease, amputation and blindness. If his job doesn’t allow diabetics, he should probably start figuring out a career transition.
