===============================================================================

I’m enrolled in the auto refill program with tandem for my insulin pump supplies. Last week I received an email indicating my supplies were ready to be shipped and to look out for shipping information. Is been a week and no update. I called them and they have no idea why my order has not shipped nor can they give me an answer on when it will ship. Very frustrated because I followed their instructions and they can’t get me my stuff on time

2. u/mystisai [score=1, created=2025-11-13T12:19:19]: October I got my "being processed" email on the 5th. I got the "your order has shipped" on the 23rd, delivered the 29th. Nov 1st I got the "being processed" email. No second email yet. Sept was the 6th, 22nd, 29th. This is the standard timeframe for me. Every 3rd or 4th shipment is 2 boxes of each, so eventually you will have way too much.

That isn't easy either, but it is sometimes possible. Changed prescriptions to see if a different brand is easier to source, and I will see next quarter.
