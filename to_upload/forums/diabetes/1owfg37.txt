===============================================================================

Every morning for the last several weeks, no matter what I do my sugar spikes high. Today it spiked at 256 at 8:38 and then dropped to 66 by 10:30. I’ve tried eating protein, same thing. Eating nothing, same thing. Heck I tried eating sugar to see if it would stop that hell of a Drop, same thing. Why?

I completely got rid of dawn phenomenon by drinking alot of water to decrease the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. I'm 5'1 female and i drink at least 1 gallon of water per day. And then to reduce cortisol, i stretch every morning, and then have a glass of water and go walk the dog. The exercise helps circulation and the fresh air + nature lowers stress.

It hasn’t got the memo that we no longer need that sugar/cortisol dump. Normal folks have a healthy pancreas to add insulin to manage. We diabetics have yet *another* thing to have to deal with. I am “fortunate” in that I have to dose insulin before my feet hit the floor, so I have insulin working. I’m not sure what a T2 could do…maybe a brisk walk for 20 minutes to get system to process the sugar? (Like we all have 20 minutes to spare early in the morning. 🙄)
