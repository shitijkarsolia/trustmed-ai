2. u/PinnatelyCompounded [score=4, created=2025-11-13T16:53:49]: I've never heard of a diabetes management company. Do you have an example of one? What do they do?
3. u/Shagtacular [score=5, created=2025-11-13T18:54:39]: Try talking to a qualified doctor instead. Diabetes management programs sound like a scam. I've been type one for thirty years without hearing that term
4. u/Puzzleheaded-Phase70 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T18:59:10]: In what countries? In the US, I didn't think I've seen that as a specific thing. Health insurance and healthcare providers offer various services, weight and diet help apps and programs often cater to diabetic needs, and meal kit services sometimes have diabetic options (they usually suck and cost much more than the grocery store). And of course companies sell diabetic medical supplies. But I don't think I've seen it all under one roof. It might be challenging to do that in the US, honestly, because there's a lot of laws about what you can and cannot do with "mixing" formal medical care services and commercial services. At least, if you're billing insurance for anything. I would kinda love to see a little "planned cooperation" built around diabetic and related needs, now that you mention it. * A medical clinic * Dieticians who specialize in the different types of diabetes and diabetic options. * A gym with coaches and classes specifically trained in diabetes needs * A cooking school for home cooks * A grocery store that sources diabetic-safe foods and organizes them with attention to the different kinds of diets we do. * A medical supply corner that just has ALL the diabetes stuff. * Day spa with people trained to notice and help with common diabetic skin problems What else could we put in this magical one-stop-shop? In-house fitness tracker devices and apps, specifically made and written by diabetic developers and that interface well with other apps?

I saw that you are a med student and may have an idea as a startup or something, it's a whole different ecosystem here. The business model has to be totally different from India. In India these programs run cheap and rely mostly on coaches. In the US the successful ones (Virta, Omada, Livongo, Signos, Lark Health) work because they plug directly into insurance and employer health plans. The money doesn’t really come from the patient, it comes from insurers reimbursing remote monitoring, telehealth, and diabetes-care codes. In the US you need actual clinicians, not just coaches, to adjust meds, monitor CGM data, and bill Medicare/insurance. You also need HIPAA compliance, FDA-safe workflows, and state-licensed telehealth. The upside is much higher revenue: US companies can bill around 1500 to 3500 dollars a year per patient, plus recurring monthly reimbursement for remote monitoring. The downside is higher acquisition cost, higher regulation, and more complexity. I hope that answers your quest, or it may be irrelevant. I just took a chance.

9. u/PoppysWorkshop [score=1, created=2025-11-14T02:57:45]: The company I use is "Me, Myself and I". With a little help from my PCP. My T2 is now under control. My A1C and Blood glucose are now in the high normal range for the last 9 months, my Stage 2 hypertension under control now normal for the last 10 months, my high cholesterol and triglycerides, now normal, liver and kidney functions now normal. I did it though meds, listening to my PCP, losing weight, cutting out sugars, no white carbs, no refined grains, nix on the fried foods, run away from processed foods. Pretty much a near keto diet, exercise being in the gym 4x week doing cardio and weight lifting. My insurance company, my local hospital and even the company I work for provide free resources if I need it. Your PCP and specialists, are also sources of information. Any company you have to pay for a "Program" is full of shit.
