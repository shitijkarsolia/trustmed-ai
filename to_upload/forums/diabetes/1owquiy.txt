===============================================================================

I got diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 12.6% in April 2024. I went low carb straight away, started walking and lowered my A1C to 5.6% within 6 months. I have been low carb, except a few days like christmas or birthdays where I had the occassional slice of cake or some potatoes/bread. Everytime I had carbs alone, I spiked hard like in the 200s. My doctor, however, has always been insistent that I need to eat carbs. Her guideline that she gave me has examples like 2 breadrolls or 3 potatoes or 1 cup of rice for lunch. Everytime I have eaten rice, I have spiked. So I have stayed low carb for over a year. In my last appointment in August, my A1C was at 5.7, so borderline again, but I expected that since I was in bedrest for 2 months due to an ankle fracture. She was again very insistent that I eat more carbs and if carbs spike me so much then she could increase my medication. I take metformin 500 mg once a day and I really don't want more meds. I can barely remember to take that one pill everyday. So I thought, fuck it, I'm going to eat more carbs and when the next blood test happens the results will show her why I'm low carb. I ate *almost unrestricted* for the last three months. I ate rice, not daily but definitely more than before, I had bread regularly, I ate croissants and puff pastries for breakfast twice a week or so, I ate chocolates, snacked on chips in bed, I even had cakes and ice cream. I also finished a whole pack of Spekulatius biscuits within a week a couple weeks ago (these are full of sugar and just eating 5 spiked me to 240). I knew I was damaging my body but I wanted to prove a point really. My blood test was on Tuesday and I just got my results. My A1C is at 5.5% and my Cholesterol has improved. I am reeling with confusion. What the fuck happened?

2. u/clintCamp [score=2, created=2025-11-14T05:34:32]: I think maybe restricting carbs too much causes higher spikes when you do get them? I have been relaxing my diet lately, but just finger prick once or twice a day and oddly mine is behaving well recently. I just did 6 months of hard core low carbs and have started making my own sourdough bread again which I now add lots of whole grains and extra fiber to and it seems like I can almost eat a good amount of carbs now as long as it has sufficient fiber. I don't know have a CGM currently so I have no clue what it is doing throughout the day, so who knows if relaxing is better or worse for me yet.

Mine were the same. I am still staying with lower carbs as it's both easier to manage and feels better. We landed on that I should not go below 1g/kg/day which is fine with me as it's hard to stay lower on a vegetarian diet anyways. But I definitely wouldn't sacrifice my health risks, especially for a few months, just to prove the point. Maybe just try to consider how you feel: is it better with low carb, or better when you let it go - both physically and mentally.

Bulls**t I think there are alot of people who experience temporary diabetes, like hepatogenous or if u had some crazy infection wich made your number go nuts before u test a1c, if u took cortison or something else all of this doctors must add up and put into the diagnosis. But gps are fast to diagnose, only real way to know is if u have a normal FBG and do an OGTT if u clear it by WHO standards i would say u dont have diabetes, let the downvotes come…
5. u/throwaway_ga33 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T11:12:44]: My nutritionist stressed the importance of having at least one but up to three carb choices per snack or meal due to your liver releasing glucose if you don’t have enough carbs, thus causing your sugars to be higher
6. u/Healthy-Zebra-9856 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T16:45:55]: How much saturated fat did you eat? Red meat, full fat dairy etc? You don't have to be exact. Was it frequent or rarely?
