The difference between 6.4 and 6.5 for an A1c is well within the analytical imprecision of almost if not all laboratory Instruments currently on the market. Ignore it, especially if the two results come from two different labs. You are right where you were after the first A1c. I hope that makes sense.
2. u/RandomThyme [score=15, created=2025-11-14T03:21:14]: 6.5 A1c is still quite good and is generally the target that is recommended in most cases. You are allowed to enjoy the holidays. I do. I'm Canadian so we already did our Thanksgiving. Had all the fixings including some pecan pie. Its only a couple of days so enjoy you holiday and get back on track on Tuesday. Maybe just fit a walk in after dinner and see if you can convince some family to join you. Start a new tradition.

That said, veg and salads, go easy on the carbs
5. u/HellDuke [score=2, created=2025-11-14T03:58:08]: Can't speak to type 2s and how those expexcations are, but as a type 1 I'd call that a rounding error difference. Once you are in the range between a 6 and a 6.5 it's ideal control with no further changes needed. Closer to 7, maybe something can be slightly tweaked. My lats ones jumped between 6.1 and 6.7 and I pay no mind to it.
6. u/psoriasaurus_rex [score=1, created=2025-11-14T08:26:43]: 6.5 and 6.4 are basically the same. Your a1c is likely to be up or down a few tenths of a point each time you test it. Our glucose levels constantly fluctuate. Also, all lab tests have a small margin of error. What you want to watch is the trend, not slight variations. And also, 6.5 is usually considered well controlled for a diabetic.
7. u/Prof1959 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T11:45:26]: Well within the range of error. Don't even think about it.
