===============================================================================

My mouth is literally ON fire, feels dry yet hydrated at the same time. So does my throat. I’ve downed a litre of bottle the past hour, my stomach is literally bloated like a balloon.. feels like it’s gna burst if I drink anymore. but I can’t get rid of this stupid thirst???? Somebody give me advice on how you handle this please 😓 Edit : hai little update ! Thank you for all your concerns ❤️ my blood sugar was thru the roof, I eventually got rushed into ER after my dad found me on the floor &amp; I’m now doing a little better! I’m only 16 and just gotten diagnosed a little while back in October so all this is new and scary for me and I didn’t even know what DKA was until this happened. I was fine one moment, until I wasn’t.

5. u/Wooptay [score=5, created=2025-11-14T07:35:53]: If your BG is high and you are having these issues - go to the ER - now. You are likely in a DKA. If your BG is high and you have short-acting insulin at hand, administer some and then go. When you arrive to the hospital, tell them how much insulin you've already administered and when. Do not put this off as it can turn very dangerous very quick. I assume that if it was in your ability to correct the BG to a normal level, you already would have done so. Since that seems to have not been the case, you should get help from the doctors. It happens to many diabetics, you will not be the first one they see and they will know exactly what to do. To add: if possible have someone else drive you, otherwise call an ambulance.

As everyone else has said, you're likely in DKA and you cannot ignore it, it's not like a headache that will pass, this shit can literally kill you. Please seek medical help. And please reply to at least one of us, you've got strangers fearing for your life here 😧

I'd really keep an eye on yourself and consider your options. check your ketones, give corrections through insulin pen not pump.

10. u/kimpurple21 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:10:00]: I am a T2 and take metformin - one of my side effects is dry mouth and thirst, I have taken to using cough/throat lozenges, my favorite are Altoids and the swiss herb cough drops you know rickola. Keep staying hydrated - I do Good luck,!
11. u/rourobouros [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:19:22]: Good to hear you are back. Your report on symptoms actually is helpful to me, as I suffer from dry-mouth and wonder if it’s high glucose - I think it is, even though I’m T2. Now take this very seriously. You can handle it, my grandfather was one of the first cohort with T1 who survived, as they had just developed insulin when he was diagnosed. Lived without test strips etc, just rigorous diet, exercise (had a farm) and insulin injected every morning. Passed on at over 75 about 1980. We do much better.
