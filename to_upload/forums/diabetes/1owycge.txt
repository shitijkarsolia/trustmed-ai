===============================================================================

I spent the day at Disneyland yesterday and walked around 24,000 steps. Towards the end of the day, half of my big toe had gone completely numb. I had hoped that it was just a temporary thing caused by swelling or something, but I woke up this morning and it’s not any better. For reference, my only experience with (probable) neuropathy so far has been occasional tingling in that same toe. My last A1C was 6.1
