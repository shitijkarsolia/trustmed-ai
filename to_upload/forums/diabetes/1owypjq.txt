===============================================================================

This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. On December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, "What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?" I responded, "Treat my what now?" And he said, "Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician." So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. My primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. I did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. For my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. After 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. When I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate "when I felt hungry" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. In June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. In July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. This has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. I hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades.

Because that is how I am trying to look at it. I am eating healthier and exercising more than I have in decades and I can see myself getting into better shape than I have been in 35 years. Do I wish I didn’t have diabetes? Gosh yes! But, is it a great motivator? Yes, indeed!!!
