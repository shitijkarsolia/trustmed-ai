My doctor put me on metformin to help with blood sugar control and weight loss. I'm on 500 MG right now and on day 3 and omg the nausea and tummy cramps. I've done some reading online about eating smaller portions and not eating carb heavy food might help but does anyone have other suggestions aswell? I'm working on adjusting my diet per my doctor's instructions and that is helping some. I just wanted to hear others experience with this medication and some of the at home things yall tried that helped out with stomach issues. Also side question but any low carb/keto recipes, recipe books or website recommendations for someone trying to get their health in check? Thx everyone!

2. u/StrbryWaffle [score=5, created=2025-11-14T09:53:36]: I had really bad stomach cramps when I started metformin. Someone suggested Gas-X (simethicone) and it helped! So does eating it in the middle of a meal. Eat half, take the pill, eat the rest

After a couple of months I hardly thought about it. It also worked to decrease my appetite and make my hunger spells less intense. Since I needed (need) to lose weight, I viewed the decrease in my eating as a positive. Make sure you sandwich your pill into your meal. Since you are just taking one pill per day, try it at different meal times.

I haven’t experienced the nausea like you have, but I do feel sick as a dog right now. big scary numbers coming up on the glucometer. This is all new to me and I’m so glad you posted this. It helps a lot to be able to relate to someone right now.
7. u/FigFiggy [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:15:06]: I was not able to tolerate Metformin at all, it made me vomit and have constant nausea. I had to be taken off completely after a week, it never got any better and my endocrinologist said it just doesn’t agree with some people.
8. u/secretsnowdream [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:30:42]: My Dr put me on Jardiance instead.
9. u/human72949626383 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:32:31]: I changed to taking all of it at night and all symptoms went away. It’s a lot to take at once but my body seems to tolerate it much better.
10. u/Dry_Photograph_3559 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T09:53:12]: I was on metformin and it gave me really bad diarrhea. My kidneys actually shut down from dehydration and I ended up in the hospital for a week. I am now on glipizide and I haven’t had any stomach problems and A1C seems to be ok.
11. u/Odd-Professor-5309 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T10:48:11]: Always take Metformin after a meal, not on an empty stomach. And time will settle down the bad side effects. Mine were terrible for 3 months, but everything is OK for the past 7 months.
