===============================================================================

As the title states I am wondering if I should get a second opinion... A little backstory; I have PCOS and have been pre-diabetic for the last 10 years- if not more. A1c has hovered around 5.5-5.8 on and off. Took metformin, tried changing diet on my own and always struggled. June of this year my A1c crawled up to 6.5 and consistently stayed there. My doc diagnosed me with T2 diabetes. It runs in the family and even though i knew that it still was a shock. I was put on Munjaro and have been very successful. Bs is anywhere from 100-150...only ever seen it creep towards 200+ when I ate deli fried chicken or McDonald's..which id say is a normal reaction. Just wondering if I should get a second opinion? Do I really have t2 or still prediabetic? Do doctors every undiagnose ppl with things? Or am i just really lucky to have good results on munjaro? I fear if i ever get off it I might not be as successful managing my bs.

My A1C shot up to 10.7 but now I have it down to around 6.0. That’s considered pre diabetic range but I’m not pre diabetic. I am a diabetic whose diabetes is controlled. So are you. If you stopped taking your medication your A1C would likely go right back up.

There is a chart that shows you if you google it. You’ll be fine. I’m Mexican and knew eventually it would get me. Everyone in my family has it. There’s some stupid percentage for Mexicans that are bound to get it.

I also take it and I have not ever seen a spike anywhere near 200 since I started it, no matter what I’ve eaten. My a1c is down to 5.1 because of the Mounjaro. I’m still diabetic though.

It hit me one day with a flu like illness where my son brought me to the E R with sugar of over 600 - you are now diabetic - work on your log, keep your aic and glucose low and try everything - every person is different, keto helps most, vegan helps others you have to find your path, omad helps me that knowledge comes after years of trying different diets, when not on omad the Mediterranean diet worked for me. Instead of a second opinion, focus on what works for you. Cheat days are okay but remember to balance it and keep hydrated your meds are flushing sugars into your bladder/liver etc so fluid keeps that system flowing. Good luck!
