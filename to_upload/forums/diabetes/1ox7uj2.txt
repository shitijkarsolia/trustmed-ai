===============================================================================

My dad's blood report came back in and he's 56 years old. His glucose is at 190mg/dL. His last two results back in 2023 and 2022 were 129mg/dL and 115mg/dL. His A1C is 10.4. The last two results were 7.0 and 6.8. His BUN/Creatinine and LDL were kind of high too. 30 and 146. It have been related to being dehydrated and with the cholesterol, I'm going to do my best to help him lower his oily food intake. I don't know what to do with the rest. I feel like he's been controlling what he eats, but clearly it isn't enough. Does anyone here see a dietician? I've always wanted him to create a strict diet plan. I know there's a plethora of information on this subreddit, but I'm also scared as much as I'm asking for help. I've been reading some other threads and here are some things I've going to encourage/enforce my dad to do. \- eliminate white rice and other carbs entirely and replace them with quinoa and other replacements \- 30 minute walks after dinner. He works during other meals, so he isn't able to walk. \- Really focus on limiting simple carbs and replacing them with fruits, veggies, meat, fibers, etc. \- My dad snacks throughout the day. It'll be stuff like nuts like peanuts. Is this good or bad for a diabetic? My dad's results are absolutely uncontrolled. I'd love anymore tips and advice, it's not like we have any room left to slack. I need to help my dad immediately

In some cases, people can manage with 2 of the 3, but a lot of people need all three. Honestly, his doctor should have provided guidance on what changes need to be made to help bring that HbA1C down 3-4 points. If this doctor is a Primary Care, then he should find an endocrinologist who is better equipped to provide this guidance. Please keep in mind, carbohydrates raise glucose, no matter where they come from. Quinoa and fruit are carbohydrates. Walks after every meal could be beneficial. Regular medication (per doctor) also helps. There are no "good for diabetic" foods. There are foods with lower impact, but even protein can raise glucose. Also every diabetic has a different reaction to food and medication, so there is no "do this and you'll be fine" advice that can be given.

Once my blood glucose got under control, cholesterol and other markers all came down. A1C went from 14.5 in Oct 2024, to 5.7 in Jan 2025. In addition to metformin and Mounjaro, I took rosuvastatin to lower cholesterol. I also radically changed how I ate and added exercise daily, so I wouldn’t be able to pinpoint a particular lifestyle change. All together these changes and medications made huge changes , and I feel so much better all around. All you can do is present him with examples of positive behaviors and medications that have helped others, and support him as he makes the decisions. That is so hard. My family has been great as I’ve been making changes and are very supportive-so know that he appreciates your support. Change is tough, and I hope he takes this seriously!!
5. u/Namasiel [score=4, created=2025-11-14T14:23:57]: His random glucose tests aren't alarming, but his most recent a1c is. It means that no, he has not been taking care of himself. And, as an adult, there's nothing you can do to make him do so. It won't get better until he decides he wants it to, sorry. He needs to talk to his doctor. He will likely need medication along with diet and lifestyle changes, but all that's completely on him.

7. u/wcg66 [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:28:18]: As someone who has gone through kidney failure, the creatinine numbers need to be taken seriously. The thing with creatinine level is that “slightly” elevated can mean a significant drop in kidney function, it’s not linear. A more important number is the eGFR which is usually listed with the creatinine results. Obviously, the diabetes aspect needs short term attention but do follow up with the kidney function testing. Also, blood pressure has a big impact on kidney health, it’s another thing to monitor in this situation.
8. u/PredictableChaos [score=2, created=2025-11-14T14:39:57]: I would not start with or expect a strict diet plan if you want him to follow it. Unless it is him making that choice he may just rebel against it and cheat more (we may be older but we all have our faults). He also doesn't need to eliminate carbs entirely. Quinoa has plenty carbs in it, btw. 1 cup of Quinoa has 39g of carbs which is way over what I allow for a meal. White rice is 45g. I will sometimes eat one of those but I just don't each that much. You might suggest he wear a CGM for a month or two to track what foods spike him more than others. He'll most likely have to pay for it out of pocket but it can be super valuable to have a better understanding of what impacts. His doctor would need to write a prescription for it and then it's probably going to be 120-150 for a month supply (one is good for two weeks). My wife and I are both T2 and we spike to different foods. The other thing he might learn is if he eats his protein/fats first the affect on his blood sugar will be less because his body will take longer to process the carbs. But the CGM will give you good data of what affects *him.* I would not focus on the BUN or LDL numbers unless the doctor is actually concerned about them. I'd be surprised if he's not already on a statin though since he's uncontrolled with what sounds like high cholesterol. That is a normal protocol for a T2 at his age.

It is surprisingly helpful. Bonus if you do it every half hour. Even small amounts of exercise help increase insulin sensitivity and open our cells to receive the glucose. Are those his waking numbers? There are a couple of reasons that your blood sugar can rise while you are sleeping. 1. A "leaky liver" which gets signals that your glucose is low in the body and it releases glucose in the bloodstream. A small snack of 15-20g of carbs before bed can actually help with that. Medicine like Metformin can help calm the liver and prevent "leaking." 2. Is called the Dawn Phenomenon, where hormones are released to stress your body into waking up and increase your glucose in the blood. I find that 5 minutes of moderate exercise before bed helps me maintain good blood sugar to the morning and makes my sleep more restful. Speaking of sleep, it is very important to get a good nights rest. It helps maintain good blood sugar levels throughout the day. Eat your veggies first. Fiber digests more slowly in the body and if you eat your nonstarchy veggies first it slows down your digestion. Then protein and save carbs for last. Medicines like Ozempic, Trulicity, and Rybelsus also help slow your digestion and soften the impact of glucose in your blood.

12. u/Itchy-Ad1005 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T15:11:39]: You've already got some good comments. I'll toss my 2 cents in. Nuts in general are a very good snack since they are protein, fat and fiber. I'd limit macadamia nuts and pecans because they are pretty high in calories. If they nuts are salted limit them because of the salt. Like anything consume in moderation I often use nuts as a snack with a rocket apple and maybe a piece of cheese. I might toss in some other good raw veggie like a couple broccoli florets. Lot of good cruchiness in all if that. My blood sugar fairly changes. If I want it to go up I add about 6 Ritz Crackers. They are basically nothing but quickly digested carbs.
