===============================================================================

Has anyone with Type 2 had a dramatic increase in their typical daily blood glucose over a period of a few months? Since the spring my diet has remained the same. I am on diabetes drugs but not insulin. But since the spring my blood sugar has gone from being basically well-controlled to being out of control. My monitor was always showing me numbers that were “green” before, but now it is in the yellow zone most of the time. I am going to have a blood test next week to check how my A1c has changed in that period and then I am talking to my doctor. I am not asking for medical advice - I am just wondering if this has happened to anyone else. I feel very alone struggling with this issue. I am hoping I am not alone in having this happening over a period of six months.
