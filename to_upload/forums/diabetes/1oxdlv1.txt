===============================================================================

Hi all. I recently went to my pcp to develop a treatment plan for my diabetes which is uncontrolled. I got put on Mounjaro 2.5mg and I take 15u of long acting insulin at night. Since my doctors appointment last week I’ve increased exercise and started eating more diabetic friendly meals. I’ve now taken my second mounjaro shot and I’m responding really well to the medicine. So far one weeks worth of work has helped me get back into the 100s/150s after a period of constant 350+. I’m going to keep going. My only issue is I have these headaches that are like pressure almost and I can’t shake them. I thought it’s because I started eating less so I increased my eating (especially protein and fiber). They go away then they come back and they’re almost nauseating. I might think that this is the result of me trying to stabilize my blood sugar, but idk. I can’t even figure out where to start.

When I mentioned that to my Endo doc he said that if I keep my sugar low the headaches will go away. They said that about diabetic foot pain too - I have had my sugars under control for years and I still have the foot pain that now starts during the day. I hope your headaches subside good luck!
