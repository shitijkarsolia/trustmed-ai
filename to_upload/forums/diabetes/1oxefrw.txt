===============================================================================

I have had a A1c 6.1 for 2 years and was on a waiting list for Ozempic. I finally got the call to be put on it and after blood work I had a A1C of 6.0 but my fasting glucose was 7.6 and the second one was 7.1. I was having a panic attack before the second test and freaking out. Not sure if that did anything to the test. I have to wait 3 weeks now to talk to my dr because he is on vacation so I am stuck not knowing what to do or what to think. I’ve googled ( probably the worst thing I could do) all complications and now I’m having severe health anxiety and GAD. I’m scared to eat, I go for a walk everyday and after I don’t know what to do I feel like I need to be doing something. Can’t relax and read a book because that’s not doing anything. I’m at a loss.

An A1C of 6.1% is around 7 mmol/l. An A1C of 6.1% isn't going to give you complications, maybe in 50 years, definitely not in 3 weeks.

Freaking out all the time ain't gonna help anything, im speaking from experience here. Aha. Good thing is life with this disease can be managed, effects everyone differently so will take trial and error with food, meds etc. Take a breather, had my share of health anxiety at the beginning but its gone now. You got this.
