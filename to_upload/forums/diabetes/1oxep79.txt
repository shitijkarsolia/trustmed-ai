Hey folks, hope you’re all having a good day. Recently I’ve been experiencing an absolutely terrible amount of brain fog and other cognitive issues, moreso than my normal amount from being b12 deficient and it has become absolutely unbearable. I ate a lot of carbs recently, which I admit was a bad choice, and I’m terrified I gave myself permanent vascular brain damage or something. The carb spike was two days ago, and I just tested my blood sugar and my numbers are 81mg/dl. Yesterday I was at 104mg/dl. I do have poor circulation from diabetes, but it’s not horrible, and I’ve only been diabetic for ~1 year (was prediabetic for the year before that). Will the brain fog and other symptoms improve with better blood sugar control? I’m absolutely struggling and I just want a bit of hope, or honesty if there is no hope to be had.

I had a lot of brain fog, inability to concentrate and bad decision-making. But it basically went away as my glucose levels went down. Your numbers seem in the normal range though.
