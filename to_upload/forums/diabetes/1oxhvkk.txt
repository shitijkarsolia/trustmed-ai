===============================================================================

So my dad has had swelling and pain in his foot the past month or so. But now he has absolutely no feeling in them. He went to a specialized foot doctor today and they said that he probably has Charcot foot. He also has an ulcer on the bottom of his foot. My dad is the only worker in the house and if he can’t work we’re essentially screwed. So the doctor said he needs to rest and stay off his feet and wear a boot. But he works in a factory where he has to constantly stand. He has the ulcer clean and protected under bamdages and he has braces on his feet to help provide some stability. He has some reinforced shoes coming in soon that he can wear to work as well. So with all that said I wish he wouldn’t but I also know there really isn’t a choice. We would use FMLA but we had to use it a year ago for an open heart surgery /and that won’t renew until April 29. So is there any way he can continue on working under the conditions he works with the proper care given to his feet. He can’t wear the boot to work but he can wear it around the house and he can rest all he wants. But I’m really worried about my dad he’s a hard working man and I hate to see him suffer the way he does.
