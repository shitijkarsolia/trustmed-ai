===============================================================================

Finger poke read 128 idk if i should try taking the cgm off, I just got a new sugar meter too and it reads the same as the other one I found. Ive probably been doing worse than I thought because if the cgm is 50+ points lower than what I actually am I probably havent been in range at all lol

3. u/Apprehensive_Ad_1501 [score=1, created=2025-11-15T00:32:49]: I've been 90% in the red zone, like 54, for the last 5 days. Sometimes those Libres are just poor quality no matter placement. (In my case 'sometimes' is 50% 🤦) You can either do a mental correction every time if you think you can still trust the trend or call Abbott for a free replacement - they have clear rules, like 35%+ deviation in stable state is a warranty case
