Hey guys, I’m kinda stressed right now. Yesterday I saw a post on Facebook about a diabetic patient who got his leg cut off and it freaked me out. Last year I had bad leg pain and the doctor told me to get a diabetes test. It came out positive. The doctor said they might recommend insulin at my age but I really don’t want to take injections every day. I tried controlling it myself but it’s still not in control. I don’t feel many problems maybe because I’m young, but now I’m scared after seeing that post. If anyone has gone through something similar, please share your experience or advice. I just want to understand things better.

It is not about lifestyle changes alone, though they are significant. You probably need the insulin to give your battered pancreas breathing room. I was on insulin+ metformin for a year after I was diagnosed. Then I was able to get my numbers to non diabetic range and stayed on just metformin with diet and exercise. Taking insulin now does not mean you have to take it for life.

Listen to your doctor, make sure you take your insulin shots and watch what you eat. When it comes down to it, it's easy to control it once you know you have it AND are willing take care of yourself.

Try to get your health in order eg: dietitian, podiatrist, optometrist, dentist, exercise practitioner/physiologist. You don't have to go it alone.

The best time to start taking care of yourself was awhile ago, but the next best time is now. If it's not in control, then you need to talk to your doctor again, for both advice and maybe more medication. You need to make lifestyle changes if at all possible. Doctor will be helpful for that, but a CGM (if possible, ik they are often expensive) and limiting foods high in carbs and basic sugars are a good place to start. For me, bread and pasta shoots my sugars through the roof, so I avoid them when I can. Some days WILL be worse then others. Sometimes I'm dumb and have to deal with high sugars for awhile because I really wanted that slice of pizza. You don't need to be perfect, you just need to try to do as good as you can, and to make more good decisions over bad ones. Wish you the best of luck. I was on insulin, but got off it. If you turn things around quick, you can get off it too.
