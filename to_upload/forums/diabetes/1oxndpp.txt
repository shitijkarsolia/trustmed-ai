===============================================================================

Hi everyone, Posting for my mother (60 yrs, 80 kg). Her diabetes is completely uncontrolled despite being on insulin and oral meds. She had bleaching issues at night for a period of 2 years, but it is resolved now after gastroenterology opinion. We found in endoscopy that she had tiny nodules in esophagus, after medication her condition improved significantly. She is able to sleep now. Current treatment Insulin: Basugine (basal) – 20 units in the morning Lupinsulin R – 10 units × 3 (30 mins before breakfast, lunch, dinner) Oral meds: Acarbose 50 mg TDS Metformin (Lupimeg) 500 mg Diet: Indian vegetarian. 2 cups tea/day. Lunch &amp; dinner: 2 rotis + curry + dal. Blood sugar situation Recent readings from mySugr export (past few days): 260, 307, 327, 264, 359, 354, 391, 324, 204, 411, 346, 274, 311, 179, 131, 468, 456, 251, 361, 297… Most values are 250–450 mg/dL, with multiple spikes &gt;400. No hypoglycemia at all. Question Given these consistently high numbers, is this insulin regimen too weak, especially the basal dose and regular insulin timing? Should we discuss changing insulin type or doses with her doctor? Looking for experiences from anyone who managed similar uncontrolled levels. Thanks.

Insulin requirements vary from person to person and cannot be predicted so I cannot understand how doctors can prescribe a random dose and expect it to do any good. IMHO you should get a 2nd opinion from a doctor who understands diabetes.

Add more protein to her meals, dal is not enough protein, it also has lots of carbs so her meals are heavily just carbs. Also add some salad with legumes, helps alot. She needs to eat balanced meals and roti sabji dal is not it, that's just carbs. 2. Add 20 mins walk after each meal. Slow paced is fine just ask her to walk for 20 mins after each meal. Try these things for 2 weeks and see if makes some difference. Also keep talking to your doctor.
3. u/deacc [score=3, created=2025-11-15T03:50:11]: She definitely should be talking with her doctor. Is she have two roti per meal? So 4 in total each day? IMO, that's a lot of carbs (together with the other stuff) for each meal. She needs more protein. Good source of vegetable protein are super firm tofu and eggwhites. Can also try to do protein supplement drink (shake or powder). Also are you all keeping track of how the food she eats are spiking her sugar level? Finally, does she exercise? Like start with a slow 10 minutes walk after each meal. Good luck
4. u/SSSnakeCobra [score=2, created=2025-11-15T04:20:25]: Over 13yrs T1 diabetic here. I highly suggest to talk with a doctor who is specialized to diabetes. I just can tell you that with values like this usually there is no need for pills anymore, i guess she should change to insulin only. Never heard the one she is using now but also here ask your doctor. There are a few old insulins and a lot of modern ones. Every body reacts different and it need to be tested and andjusted, so its not like take this and youre good, its more a process to find out the best medication. With this values her HbA1c is increasing and could end bad if she continues this way. If thats an option also look for looped insulin pumps, makes it a lot easier to manage diabetes and that was the only solution for me personally, had almost the same values and ended up 4 times with DKA, which is horrible, in hospital. It could also be that oder pills she takes increase the values (not just food) or other processes in her body. Again, i highly recommend to search a doctor who is maybe more specialized to diabetes. Wish you all the best!

Hopefully her insurance is good. I have Medicare and it cost me a little over 100 bucks, full price a month is around 1,800. It is the only thing that got my blood sugar in normal range. Be careful if you put her on Ozempic, many side effects that my system would not tolerate. Good luck with your mother, and count every day a blessing, I lost my mom this past April, although she lived a long life the pain is still unreal. Inbox me anytime.

Should we discuss changing insulin type or doses with her doctor? I would discuss with the doctor, but in general you should adjust the insulin doses so that blood glucose stays in range as much as possible (typical range is 70-180 mg/dl). Before you adjust the insulin doses, it's important to be prepared how to treat hypoglycemia, if not already familiar. For health it's ideal to have both blood sugars and body weight in a healthy range. All the best

9. u/Ok-Plenty3502 [score=1, created=2025-11-15T06:19:55]: Sorry you are going through this. Try to get to an Endo at your earliest. She needs to substantially change her diet because I think it may be 90% carbs, and her body cannot handle it. If exercise is not a viable option going forward, appropriate adjustment to get a balanced diet (cut simple carbs, add lot more protein, some healthier fat of which ghee is not one of them) is a must. Adjustment of insulin dosages is required after carefully consulting with an Endo. Best of luck to you and your mom. She is lucky to have a caring offspring like you.
10. u/SouperKayyyy [score=1, created=2025-11-15T07:23:58]: Is she seeing an endocrinologist for her diabetes treatment? There are other conditions that can drive insulin resistance like menopause, Cushing’s syndrome, PCOS, hypothyroidism, etc. She could also be misdiagnosed and be a LADA type 1 diabetic. She would need to have her c-peptide and GAD antibodies tested to definitively know she is type 2. It is a different treatment plan for LADA. Diet wise, she needs to be focusing on eating fiber, then protein, and lastly carbs. Tie it all together with a fat. Think of a happy dinner plate, 2 eyes and a big open smile. One eye is protein, going to be a lot of tofu, tempeh or legumes like lentils, one eye is carbs, then the big open smile is full of low starch vegetables. Adding in walking after meals and some kind of resistance or strength training program will also help. She can start easy, even chair yoga or tai chi count. First, talk to an endocrinologist because they are the specialists that can help with diabetes and other hormone disorders.
11. u/wadesh [score=1, created=2025-11-15T08:13:39]: 30 year type 1 here. There are so many factors that impact these numbers, but this reads like insulin resistance, assuming no food/carb over use. Im in this camp and take massive amounts of insulin. 80 long acting in morning and probably another 60-100 units fast acting around meals throughout the day. Two things that helped me, weight control and close tracking via CGM with micro adjustments of insulin. Id consult with an endocrinologist if you aren’t already. It takes some trial and error to dial this in. I can share that my insulin resistance developed later, post 50s. It’s something we had to dial in after decades of low doses and good A1C. Edit. I see you are in India. I have no idea what the healthcare system is like or availability of specialists dr. If bad, see if there is some sort of tele doctor system where you could consult remotely if no specialist exists in your area. I see there are multiple ones in India, Apollo, ArtemHealth, mysmartcareDoc, Digiqure, Mantracare .
