As a runner I never have high heart rate but now it’s been running in the 70-120 randomly. If I run and after my heart rate will take 1hr before it hits 90s. Always get a alert on my Apple Watch about it. I am btw coming off a taper on Xanax but they been monitor it and going Slow. No idea. Anyone out there give me the best shot. ER struggling and packed as can be. I did have a echocardiogram done and was fine early December before this symptoms
