2. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2023-01-03T21:09:51]: Carotid artery plaque analysis is to see chances of brain stroke i guess. Echocardiogram (2dECHO) is to see for heart's structural damages, pumping efficiency, any birth defects like ASD, VSD ( holes). Do not eat meats/ high fat meals for 3 days and go for lipid/cholesterol tests. Also Lipoprotein A test. If they are high and you are 45+ years old and have any chest discomfort, pain, pressure, shortness of breath, excessive sweating while doing everyday works better to meet a cardiologist and go for Angiography to see the coronary arteries are plaqued or not. My dad is 58 years old, never smoked/ or alcohol. Vegan diet. Complains of chest pressure pain sweating episodes. Took him to cardiologist -&gt;ECG, 2D echo, cholesterol tests were done. All were normal, Except blood report of Troponin -i . (9000 mg/dl ) normal reference number is (0-40 mgdl). Immediately angiography done and it revealed 95% RCA blockage. 2 stents have been placed via angioplasty and he is doing fine now. I guess it's genetic ( i have higher lipoprotein A, currently taking niacin/ b3 for it, there's no other treatments for it as of now here ).
