===============================================================================

I had a echocardiogram done early December. I had troponin test done 3 weeks ego and everything came out fine. I do have mild acid reflux but ever had heart burn associated with it. I woke up early this morning and had burning sensation pretty much there and it went away and here it’s here again. So I’m not sure. I did try calling my cardiologist and all I ever get is. We did all the testing we would. Contact your primary. https://ibb.co/g9L6gnV

If you're not satisfied with the answers, keep pressuring them to help you. IT'S THEIR JOB, so don't let them pass you off to another doctor. When I was having my first heart attack in 2009, my chest felt like it was being crushed by a bulldozer, but all my tests kept coming back negative so the doctor tried to tell me I had acid reflux. I kept telling him no to the point of standing toe to toe screaming at each other until he finally relented and sent me to get an angiogram. They were, of course, shocked to find a 95% blockage in my LAD, which is affectionately referred to as "the widow maker" in their world. Heart attacks are all about blocked coronary arteries. ECG's and EKG's don't detect blockages, they detect heart function anomalies that *might* indicate blockages, but just because they don't indicate any issues doesn't definitively mean there aren't any. Same with coronary sonograms. Chest x-rays can be helpful, but chemical and/or treadmill stress tests are better. A troponin test only indicates whether you have elevated levels of that heart enzyme in your blood stream from a heart attack that caused actual damage. However, angina hurts as bad as a heart attack -- and can eventually lead to having a big one -- but it doesn't often cause damage on its own so there wouldn't be any elevated troponin enzyme levels. A negative troponin test means there wasn't any damage -- yet -- it doesn't mean there aren't any serious blockages causing the pain. After 12 years and 8 stents, the only definitive test I know of is an angiogram. It hurts, its invasive and it's expensive, so maybe it might not be warranted if every other test comes back negative. But if antacids or the Purple Pill don't work for your acid reflux, it might be worth taking a look. You mentioned you "woke up" with a burning sensation, and laying down can worsen acid reflux so maybe it is that. But I quite literally saved my own life because I wouldn't take no for an answer. You shouldn't either.

As someone who "looks" healthy, slim, workouts etc, but has 1 heart attack (almost 2) and 7 stents and will pass every cardiology test put in front of him, as the guy above said, be ur best advocate and also contact ur primary asap as well until someone can give u a proper diagnosis and remedy. I never experienced chest pain, only chest pressure, and probably more pressure from the stress I give myself thinking I could drop dead at any moment. To this day any chest discomfort stresses me and like most people, hate hospitals. For me, once I couldn't walk a few hundred feet without losing my breath, I knew it was serious. But don't wait like I did (lucky no heart damage), go to the ER if you're worried
