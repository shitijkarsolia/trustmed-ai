Hi everyone, I'm a student at Pace University conducting a research study on direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. I am currently seeking participants to take part in this study in the form of an anonymous survey. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of pharmaceutical advertising, and its impact on those with chronic illnesses. To participate in this study, you must: •Be a person with a chronic illness or disease •Be 18 years or older •Currently reside in the United States or New Zealand The survey is completely anonymous, and none of your personal data will be collected. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Click the link here to take the survey: https://pace.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Wsv0XkGLlfWsaq If you have any questions, please contact jp12972p@pace.edu Thank you!
