===============================================================================

I lost my mother to CHF (Chronic Heart Failure ) last year . I only have my dad now. He is 65, 5 feet 2 inches and 55 kgs. Recently he had some chest discomfort where he said he feels something is pushing heavy there. He also coughs incessantly. Is a chain smoker. Used to be a heavy drinker but now cut it to just one day. Sadly he can't seem to reduce smoking. He had high diabetes and BP once but now they have improved lots. Almost normal. He had a fever once recently but it went away after a day. Has digestive problems (possibly GERD) for years. Frequently has gas and bowel/constipation problems We did a chest X Ray but nothing much came (except he has mild calcification of aorta. Had a USG of abdomen and lower tract of GI nothing came. But the cough and occasional chest discomfort persists. Been begging him 2 go and consult a gastroenterology a d a cardiologist but he won't listen to me :( What do you all suggest ? Any theories what's possibly wrong with him ? I am hella scared

Tell him it would devastate you if something happened to him and knowing you could have prevented it and did nothing would destroy you. Ask him to go with you if not for him but for you. Some people need to be pulled into the dr office, im kind of that way. Make it as easy as possible for him. Maybe you could even do the research first amd tell him where you are gonna take him.
