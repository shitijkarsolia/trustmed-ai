Hello all! 31 year old Male. No other health issues besides IBS. Most of my life I had chest pains that are on and off/shortness of breath when playing sports or so much as walking a long flight of steps. I’ve had multiple tests done(Stress tests/EKG/Cardiogram/chest X-rays etc etc) and mostly it has been normal. I’ve also had multiple ultra sounds on my legs and they too have been normal…until today. I went to the doctor last week due to having a painful lump on leg. She ordered a MRI and a ultrasound to see how the bloodflow. I was confused about the ultrasound but did it. Igot results today saying “diffuse mild disease without focal stenosis. intimal thickrning and plaque formation” upon further research, it appears this is an issues that typically occurs with blood flow issues with the heart? I scheduled an appointment with my cardiologist and vascular doctor to try to figure this out but has anyone here dealt with this issue? It’s very little info on it on the internet.
