51m here...hoping you might be able to provide some ideas on what's been going on with my cardiac health. Two years ago, as part of a routine physical, my doctor listened to my heart and thought there was something maybe off in what he was hearing. He sent me for testing at my local cardiac clinic. I did a Holter monitor overnight and stress test. All results came back negative. All good, clean bill of health. Fast forward to just over a month ago. I noticed that I was getting this weird "ploomf" sensation in my chest very occasionally instead of a normal heartbeat. I don't know how to describe it--sort of an odd feeling, like the heart did not beat 100% correctly for that moment. It wasn't a series of weird heartbeats in quick succession or anything like that...just, every now and then, I'd notice this odd "off" heartbeat for a moment. As if I was having a weird kind of palpitation. When it happens, I can literally feel it beat slightly "weird" if I have my hand placed on my chest over my heart. My memory could be wrong, but I feel like I remember having this happen in the past, many years ago, and it would go away of its own accord pretty quickly. Anyway, back to the present: it persisted for a couple of weeks, then went away for a week, then came back again. I decided to go to the doctor (a different one; my previous one had moved away). He sent me for blood work and an EKG. Both came back negative. I only found out because I hadn't heard back for a week since the tests, so I phoned in. Sometimes I notice this weird heartbeat more often, like a few times an hour or even a few times every 10 minutes. Other times, I don't notice it for long periods of time. And sometimes, usually when I'm engrossed in something else, I don't notice it at all. So I'm just wondering what's going on. I'll be following up with this doctor, but do you folks have any advice or suggestions in the meantime as to what might be going on?

I'm literally having the same thing, with ECG's coming out negative, and both the general practitioner and my cardiologist told me it was completely normal and to not worry about it. I mostly stopped feeling mine after I was put on anti anxiety medication. If I get too anxious I can start feeling them again for a while. For me it was a lot more than once every 10 minutes during the "episodes", more like once every 10 seconds. It is scary and debilitating. I would seek out a cardiologist to make sure.

I know everyone is tired of hearing about Covid but I feel like my health went to crap after 2020 but here's the thing I'm 43 so maybe these are just changes with age? It's definitely a weird feeling because everything checks out normal when I check my heart rate and blood pressure, oxygen levels... But stress does seem to trigger it more often now that I think about it more

Did an EKG, lung xray, heart ultrasound, wore a monitor for a month. All of those came back normal (including blood work). Also went to a gastroenterologist because I suddenly developed really bad daily heartburns and pain in my stomach area. Did and endoscopy and biopsy that came back normal. Still experiencing palpitations, random pinching pain, weird heart sensations, and dull stomache pain. But every tests came back okay so I really don’t know where to go from here. It’s just making me anxious.
