===============================================================================

I had a troponin test done and came back ok. I had a echocardiogram done early December and that was fine. I do have some anxiety. It’s in the morning every time I feel like I’m about to fall asleep I get a heart sensation and it kind of frightens me and I can’t sleep now worrying that it. Oils be heart related. Like I said I had few troponin test done. Had that echocardiogram done and X-ray and everything is fine. Only pain I get is when I run a lot I get PVCs. I get little pain especially going up hill so not sure if that’s heart related or anxiety that’s I’m experiencing. Thank you.

I was suffering with this for a few months until i managed to convince myself it was nothing, then it pretty much went away. Trust your healthcare proffesionals and what they have told you. Just to confirm did you tell them about the pain from exersice?
