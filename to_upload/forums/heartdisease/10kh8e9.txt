59 YO male. not overweight. Sedentary due to chronic pain right now. Had calcium score of 0 3 years ago. Had echocardiogram and nuclear stress test last year normal. I have low iron, bad GERD, anxiety, and get chest pain from reflux, and palpatations. Have PVCs. My lipids are not terrible. A1C is 4.9. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/yi0njmp4a2ea1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6939cf6d068778379065e5539c71781e346c8b5 Is my cardio just being cautious because of the chest pain? Test is scheduled in three weeks. Please calm me down.

My ekg at my doctor appointment showed “abnormal” and they sent me to the ER where they did a CT with contrast, which is I believe a CCTA. I was so scared.. BUT it was Just to be cautious! Also did an echo because of the EKG. “Normal” is just an “average” range. From what I see, your levels that are “abnormal” are within 1-6 points of being normal, so I wouldn’t worry too much! With your heart, it’s always better safe than sorry. If you keep going back with these same issues, they are totally going to investigate, always. If your pain is chronic, of course they’re going to investigate. I know how hard it is to not fixate on things, especially with having anxiety. I totally understand your fear and I’m here if you need to talk!

3. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2023-01-25T03:13:13]: I'm 19 with congenital heart disease. Cardiologist ordered a CCTA. It didn't work out and as it turns out it was the wrong test anyway and my cardiologist just didn't know how to handle my defects. This is what you should expect: You may get prescribed something for your anxiety. I'd recommend trying a little bit of it before the day of the test so you can see how you handle it. You have to be aware enough to hold your breath during certain times. You will go in, get changed, and they will put an IV in your arm. They will likely inject you with a liquid beta blocker because your HR needs to be 60 bpm or less for the test. They may inject you with it up to three times if your HR is stubborn. They will test out the contrast by injecting a little bit to see if you're allergic. Tell them if you have any side effects. They will take pictures without contrast. Then they will have you take a medication orally to dialte your veins. Then they will inject the contrast into your IV. You should tell them if you feel funny after it but you probably will feel fine. You may think you've peed yourself after the injection. You must stay completely still as they are doing the test or else you can mess up the images. You literally can't even move a finger or toe. The entire test will be pretty short. Then you probably shouldn't drive. In my experience the beta blocker and anti-anxiety med combo really messed me up.
