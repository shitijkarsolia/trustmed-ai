===============================================================================

42y/o male, not overweight. Been having dull chest pains here and there, nothing consistent. Recently started getting heart palpitations randomly throughout the day. I had similar instances before in which doctor said stress. However, I feel a little burning in my throat and can't tell if it's heartburn or angina. Does angina feel like heartburn? Thanks.

A stress test and EKG should be able to decipher what's going on. I can tell you that the heart attack I am recovering from now was misdiagnosed by me and the ER as GERD; it was a severe burning sensation (think heartburn x 1000) that was continuos for about 2 days. It truly felt like it was eminating from my stomach and somehow the EKG in the ER did not show it as heart related. They gave me stomach meds and pain killers and sent me home. My primary care doctor figured out what was going on when he did an EKG and results clearly said HEART ATTACK. Regards and feel better

I get a tightening chest pain along with a throbbing pain in the back part of my upper left arm. Occasionally my jaw feels almost locked and painfully tightens.These episodes last approximately 1-2 minutes on average.Overall it’s like a sick hurt type of fatigue. I can tell when this misery is almost over when I actually feel a release of blood flowing through my heart again which is scary but almost feels like a rush, a very welcomed feeling of relief, it’s almost over….I’ve never felt heartburn with angina but that’s my experience . I also have c a d and it plays a big part of my angina.My episodes have slowed down, staying hydrated is very important.Hope this helps, this is my experience with angina anyway,take care!

6. u/StallionItalian69 [score=1, created=2023-01-26T11:34:03]: Interesting thoughts. Wonder if it could be an ulcer? Anyone know what angina truly feels like?

Years ago, I went to the ER. They said ekg was good , I had GERD, and sent me home. I felt bad for going to the ER and wasting everyone’s time and wasting a lot of money. I sorted to ignore that butterfly in my chest because I didn’t feel pain. Fast forward to today. I went for a pre-op checkup. I got a call for a nuclear test appt at the end of the week. I looked up my records and saw “abnormal EKG” and nothing else. I get the nuclear test results. It was shocking to me. I have gone through a lot of stuff, but this scared me. They said I have CAD and stress test was not looking good. So. It seems heart trouble can be disguised under GERD. Hnmm

At the ER , my blood tests showed no signs of heart action, they would give me what is called a "GI Cocktail" (which is amazing btw) and the pain would stop. I was not just treated for a heartburn, but an endoscopy later revealed ulcers that probably caused a lot of the trouble.
