===============================================================================

About 6 months ago i (31m) was sitting at night watching tv and suddenly i felt a single very strong heart beat, it scared me but i tried to ignore it, a minute or two later i got a second one, this time way stronger, like i've been physically hit with a fist on my chest. I stood up in fear tried to take a deep breath and wash my face and then i got hit by the third one, it felt like being punched by a professional boxer, it knocked me to the ground, for a couple seconds i couldnt hear or see anything, i got up and i was sort of limping bc my legs were really stiff and failing, i went to my girlfriend and said that i needed to go to the hospital right now no questions asked, on the way i could feel my heart rate going through the roof and down the floor within seconds of each other, i honestly tought i was dying. In the hospitol they took my pressure , it was a little high, and did an ecg and it was normal, they pumped me with sedatives and i blacked out and was sent home the following morning when i woke up. This happened for 3 days straight, the it stopped. But since it happened it changed me, now on some days when im trying to sleep and am just about to fall asleep i feel a shock/chill on my heart , it feels like my heart stops for a single second. I also get random heart palpitations, chest pains, night sweats, anxiety and i feel very tired. If i consume an above average amount of alcohol my heart goes into afib on the next day. If a have an adrenaline rush i feel a very sharp pain in my chest and if i drink any amount of caffeine i have arrhythmia. I've been to a cardiologist who did exams and said everythign was fine with my heart. I've been to a shrink who said it was a panic disorder and gave me an anxiolytic prescription, but im not convinced. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should i got to another heart doctor? Should i go to a neurologist? I'll appreaciate any input, this is deteriorating my life quality as time goes by and idk what to do

Then they’ll set you up with whatever treatment is necessary and you’ll live a happy life. Modern life is great. Don’t worry, but do advocate for yourself
