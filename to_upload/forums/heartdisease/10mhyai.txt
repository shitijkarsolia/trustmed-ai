1. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2024-10-22T07:27:20]: I wish my doctors who I see every 3 months for over 15 years for diabetes would have told me this. How I have heart disease and then didn’t do anything
2. u/FlerisEcLAnItCHLONOw [score=1, created=2025-05-27T09:03:52]: When my sister had a quadruple bypass at 35 her surgeon said her uncontrolled diabetes was basically the cause of her blockages. She had a massive stroke a few years later and has been entirely disabled ever since.
