Title: Confused about TEE result. 29 year old healthy female. Doctor rattled off concerns that sounded related to endocarditis but didn’t directly mention that I had it. Follow up in 6 mos -1 year. Looking for some insight as I wait to hear back

The report's mention of a small area of thickening on one part of the aortic valve could be due to mild calcification (a common process where calcium builds up in body tissues, including the heart), it's not significantly affecting the valve's function right now, as indicated by the normal motion. The overall context of these findings suggests that there is no significant heart valve dysfunction, and no immediate signs of endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves or the inner lining of the heart. Endocarditis also generally comes with other symptoms, like fever, chills, fatigue, chest discomfort. Assuming you don't have any of these symptoms, that’s likely why no immediate follow-up is required and you've been instructed to return in 6 months to 1 year, just to ensure that there’s no progression of the calcification or other emerging heart issues. Again, I would recommend discussing these results in detail with your doctor to get a complete understanding, particularly about why endocarditis was mentioned, and to find out whether there are any specific lifestyle modifications or monitoring that you should follow in the meantime. In general monitoring your BP at home is never a bad idea, since BPs measured in an office are sometimes higher (or less often, lower) than they are at home. AMA/AHA has good instructions on how to get a good reading: [https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/High-Blood-Pressure/measuringbpathome.pdf)

3. u/pasotours [score=1, created=2023-06-02T22:30:45]: That all sounds pretty benign. I would assume they would just say follow up with another test in some time, like 6-12 months. See what Dr. recommends. I wouldn't be overly concerned with that report till you hear more from doctor.
