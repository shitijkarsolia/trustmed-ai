===============================================================================

Had a echocardiogram December 5th. Negative. Had chest X-ray and troponin. Was normal January 25th. Started having middle chest pain. Now left side and color bone. This started happening 2 days ago. Got worse today. It’s 1:50am and it’s pretty bad. Neck. Finger tingling. I do have bad bad anxiety. I do run a lot. I do workout my chest and and simply sit-ups and push-ups for a long minute. Never had this before tho. Don’t know what to do?

New anxiety meds scrip to pick up today. If the scope comes back clean and I haven’t died by then and it’s still going on, I’m going to ask for a sonogram/cat scan. I’m exhausted.
