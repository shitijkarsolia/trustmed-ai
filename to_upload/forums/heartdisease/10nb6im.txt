===============================================================================

I am 14 male, About 6 months ago or so I started experiencing my heart beats become very fast and strong with little exercise. I used to go train football 2 days a week and was pretty fit for my entire childhood. I feel like this "tachycardia " came suddenly, I went to 3 doctors and all said I have nothing to worry about. One of them mentioned that I did have a little bit of tachycardia during my day(cuz he put a certain device on me for a day) but its nothing to worry abt. And now I can't do regular stuff I used to do like playing football continously or running I feel like it's affecting my performance. I started doing cardio recently

1. u/anonymousJsharts [score=3, created=2023-08-10T19:03:40]: I have heart condition and here’s what I would do. My condition involves irregular heart beat so Ill be taking related to that. I would go to the same doctor that had your heart monitor and express to him that you are worried about this. Then ask him if it would be possible to do a more long term heart monitor like one that lasts a week or so. Depending on what brand of heart monitor your using a day is not enough to tell if there’s any irregular heart beat going on because more long term ones can collect more data. But that is just what I would do. Hope this helps!

4. u/thumos00 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T18:29:28]: it could be supra ventricular tachycardia. just make sure it goes away on its own. look for triggers (lack of sleep, cognitive/physical overextension, some kinds of stimulants…). have a holter test done. sinus tachycardia can be even more annoying that svt/psvt.

6. u/EMarieHasADHD [score=1, created=2023-02-02T14:51:56]: Have you been tested for magnesium deficiency? You could start with a low dose magnesium glycinate or citrate supplement and see how you feel. I have tachycardia daily from atherosclerosis and 30 minutes after I took magnesium my heart rate went to the 70s. I was deficient. It’s a very important mineral for heart health and overall health. Check with your doctor or guardian first of course

8. u/Difficult_Place_7329 [score=1, created=2023-02-15T08:18:08]: Do you have it resting? About how many heart beats a minute. I would suggest keeping a little note pad or a watch that can tell you. Take resting and then try it when you are moving around. Also any flutters too. Are you really stressed about something? Like I said try it yourself and if it’s still high go to the doctor again and they can do an echmo. They monitor your heart for 7 days and it records everything. It’s different, you may need beta blockers
