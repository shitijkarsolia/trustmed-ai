I have some chest pain, I can breathe but it feels... heavier? Earlier I could not move my thumb too, until I pulled on it the other way with my other hand. Any idea what's happening? I'm a little scared

If you don't work out often or it has been a while, sore lungs and little bits of chest pain can be quite normal after an intense cardio workout. Sometimes if a person starts feeling anxious about it, any assumption under the sun can happen.

Particularly if your symptoms worsen: the chest pain, and you start becoming a little short of breath, etc. Side note: my advice for ANYONE who thinks they might be having a heart attack. Call 911. Even if you have doubt, there's no harm calling anyway. The first thing the EMTs will do is an EKG, and if there is no indication on it that you're having one. No harm, no foul. You don't have to go with them, it's totally up to you.
