===============================================================================

So I have irregular heart beats, sometimes my heart jumps and it scares the f out of me, having medical anxiety, I then go into panic attack mode and vicious circle ensues, generating more symptoms. &amp;#x200B; I have 2 heart problems : LVNC and mitral valve prolapse. I'm more and more scared that I'm gonna die juste like that so I want to take every small measure I can to keep my heart in the best shape possible. What can I specifically do, avoid, eat, etc? Exercise : I'm trying to get back to sport but very small stuff cause I'm scared it'd strain my heart too much even if doc says no worries even doing boxing or whatnot like I used to do. Food : I'm vegetarian and am trying to avoid packaged foods. Smokes and alcool : very occasional (maybe, 1-2 drinks and cigs per week until now down from being a daily heavy drinker and smoker a few years ago, but I'm trying to go cold turkey and avoid at least cigarettes) Caffeine : no more coffee. No black tea. Green tea, but I'm not sure if even green can affect my heart's rythm of whatnot.

No packaged foods, no white foods and no fast food. Those can be a treat if you crave them, but eat fruit, vegetables and fish, legumes, nuts, avocados, avocado oil…Do not eat coconut oil, it has more saturated fat than butter. You have to read labels. Exercise every day, does not have to be strenuous , but move and do sustained exercise at least 1 x/day. Heart disease can be managed. You can google American heart association , Cleveland clinic or Mayo all have heart disease diet guidelines. Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans. Good luck

It’s really good and my family likes everything I’ve made so far. Uses a good combo of spices and little salt. Trying to get my LDL down. I’m a runner and know this is a result of packaged processed foods.

8. u/1LucyLou1 [score=1, created=2025-04-06T22:09:56]: Ok, so, I finally went from heart disease to heart failure...I'm so devastated about this news. I knew that it was going to get to this point but I thought that maybe I was special enough not to get this far...haha. so, yesterday, i bought a personal 20oz smoothie blender. I'm looking for recipes that will work well with my medications and will make me feel better. Every day I feel like crap. I have to confess, I do drink alcohol daily because I'm so down about dying so young (to me, 49 is too young), so I'm looking for a dietary recipe for my smoothie blender. Could anyone help me out with suggestions...

Instead, eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats like nuts and olive oil. Regular exercise, stress management, and routine check-ups also go a long way in keeping your heart healthy.
10. u/thumos00 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T18:23:23]: your concerns are justified. switching from coffee to tea has minimal advantages, it’s better to have a lil coffee than a lot of tea. do not put on any weight. lose any excess weight (if you’re overweight ofc). err on being too light, than too heavy. eat lightly. don’t overexercise. exercise lightly &amp; a few times a week only if you feel like to.
