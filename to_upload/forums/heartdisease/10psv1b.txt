I haven't been diagnosed Anything yet but I've been feeling really horrible lately feeling like I'm gonna have a heart attack chest pains limbs being cold or numb and then I got a result back saying AV Block if anybody can help me decipher this it would be much appreciated Davis, MD Measurements Intervals Axis Rate: 71 P: 44 PR: 246 QRS: 28 QRSD: 97 T: 39 QT: 358 QTc: 389 Interpretive Statements SINUS RHYTHM WITH FIRST DEGREE AV BLOCK No acute ST segment elevations or depressions, no STEMI. Normal axis, QTC Compared to ECG 05/12/2021 10:49:24 First degree AV block now present ST (T wave) deviation no longer present Electronically Signed On 1-23-2023 3:30:30 PST by Colin Davis, MD Component Results EXAM: CHEST RADIOGRAPH, 2 VIEWS, 1/23/2023 3:57 AM HISTORY: Chest pain.

2. u/OkCookie7180 [score=3, created=2024-10-04T04:53:28]: I can definitely relate to the stress and uncertainty you're feeling right now. My father went through something similar a few years ago, and I remember how scared and helpless we all felt. The constant worry about his health, the unanswered questions, and that nagging feeling of "what if" weighed on us heavily. But thankfully, preventative scanning ended up playing a huge role in his recovery. He was in his mid-50s and, like you, started experiencing odd symptoms of chest pain, cold limbs, and general discomfort. He brushed it off at first, thinking it was just stress or fatigue from work. But the symptoms didn’t go away, and after some convincing from our family, he decided to get a heart scan. Thankfully, he did. The scan showed that he had a blockage in one of his arteries, something none of us had expected. He wasn’t diagnosed with anything serious yet, but the early discovery of this blockage meant we could act before it became a full-blown heart attack. His doctors were able to start treatment right away, putting him on medication and adjusting his lifestyle to reduce his risks. The whole thing really opened our eyes to how important these preventative tests are, especially when the symptoms are there but nothing seems immediately wrong on the surface. The scan was a turning point it helped prevent something much worse from happening. He’s been doing great ever since, and it was all thanks to catching the issue early. Seeing how much a simple scan changed his life has made me more proactive about my own health too. I hope your results give you the answers and relief you're looking for and just know that you're not alone in this. Early detection can make all the difference!

5. u/Legal-Side6464 [score=1, created=2023-03-25T17:41:13]: EXAM: CT ANGIO CARDIAC W/ CALCIUM SCORE 8/12/2022 3:13 PM HISTORY: Chest pain PRIOR REVASCULARIZATION: None TECHNIQUE: Acquisition: Scout images, Noncontrast prospectively triggered exam, test bolus, retrospectively ECG-gated . Delayed images were not acquired. Multiple data sets were reconstructed at different R-R intervals, if applicable. Multiplanar post processing and 3D volume rendering were performed and interpreted. A maximum width full field of view was also reconstructed and reviewed. Radiation dose protection: In accordance with CT policies/protocols and the ALARA principal, radiation dose reduction techniques (such as automated exposure control, adjustment of mA/kV according to patient size and/or iterative reconstruction technique) were utilized for this examination. Total DLP: 740 mGy*cm 3-D volumetric reconstructions were generated by the interpreting radiologist and stored to PACS. CONTRAST: There was an uneventful intravenous administration of 106 cc of IsoVue 370. A normal saline flush was injected immediately following each contrast injection. COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: QUALITY: Good. There are no uninterpretable segments. HEART RATE AND RHYTHM: Rhythm: Sinus as documented in the image record. Average heart rate: 90 Stenoses and are reported in accordance with the CAD-RADS Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System, a consensus statement of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, American College of Radiology, and North American Society of Cardiovascular Imaging (Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography 2016): CAD-RADS 0 - (0% maximal stenosis): No plaque or stenosis; Documented absence of CAD CAD-RADS 1 - (1-24%) Minimal stenosis or plaque with no stenosis; Minimal non-obstructive CAD CAD-RADS 2 - (25-49%) Mild stenosis; Mild non-obstructive CAD CAD-RADS 3 - (50-69%) Moderate stenosis CAD-RADS 4A - (70-99%) Severe stenosis CAD-RADS 4B - (Left main &gt;50% or 3-vessel obstructive &gt;= 70% disease) CAD-RADS 5 - (100%) Total coronary occlusion CAD-RADS N - Non-diagnostic study; obstructive CAD cannot be excluded Modifiers: V (vulnerability: at least 2 high risk plaque features are present such as low density, positive remodeling, napkin ring sign, spotty calcification); S (stent), G (graft), The CAD-RADS classification should be applied on a per-patient basis for the clinically most relevant (usually highest-grade) stenosis. All vessels greater than 1.5 mm in diameter should be graded for stenosis severity. CAD-RADS will not apply for smaller vessels (&lt;1.5 mm in diameter). NATIVE CORONARY ARTERIES: Anomalous origin of the LCx arising from the right coronary cusp (separate ostium from RCA) coursing posteroinferior to the aortic root (retroaortic course) and extending to the left atrioventricular sulcus (7/59-70). No slitlike ostium or mural segment identified. . There is right artery dominance. *Left Main (LM): no plaque; no luminal narrowing. The left main bifurcates into LAD and LCx. *Left anterior descending (LAD): no plaque; no luminal narrowing. Two patent diagonal (D) branch(es) identified with prominent D1. The distal LAD wraps around the apex. *Left circumflex (LCx): Anomalous origin of the LCx as discussed above. no plaque; no luminal narrowing. One patent obtuse marginal (OM) branches identified. *Right coronary artery (RCA): no plaque; no luminal narrowing. The posterior descending artery (PDA) and the posterior left ventricular (PLV) branches originate from the RCA and LCx, respectively. CALCIUM SCORE: The observed Agatston Calcium Score is 0. CARDIAC MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTION: The right and left ventricles are morphologically normal. The left atrium is within normal limits in size. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. VALVES: Unremarkable CT appearance of the aortic and mitral valves. PERICARDIUM: Normal pericardial thickness. No significant pericardial effusion or calcification. GREAT VESSELS: No significant atherosclerotic changes are seen in the thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection identified. No filling defect identified in the central pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. NONCARDIAC FINDINGS: No significant non cardiovascular imaging findings are appreciated. IMPRESSION: *Anomalous origin of the LCx arising from the right coronary cusp (separate ostium from RCA) coursing posteroinferior to the aortic root (retroaortic course) and extending to the left atrioventricular sulcus. No slitlike ostium or mural segment identified. *CAD-RADS 0: No plaque nor stenosis. Calcium score is 0. *Preserved global and regional resting left ventricular systolic function. .......
