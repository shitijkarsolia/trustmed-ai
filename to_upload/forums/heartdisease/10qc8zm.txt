===============================================================================

Tried reaching out to my doctor about it, but he dismissed my concerns because i am 17 and "at my age, if something like that were to kill me I wouldn't see it coming" (his words. way to reassure my already health-anxious self!). I tried looking it up everywhere and can't find anybody with the same symptom. I've been feeling abnormally tired for the past month or so, like downright exhausted. On the 9th, I felt a weird, crushing tightness that left me breathless, right under my sternum, like a palpitation but more insistent and constant, of a duration of less than a second to two second at most. It happened a second time a few hours later, which led me to go to the ER. Blood test &amp; ECG came back okay. Completely forgot about it until tonight; it came back. Same thing, less than a second. It doesn't really hurt; it's more uncomfortable than anything, but it makes me breathless for that period of time and it feels like my brain disconnects during it. Wouldn't be able to explain better than this. I feel a weird leftover sharp sensation over the right side of my sternumn, not really painful but like something is in the way. It's just a little uncomfortable. Anyone else ever had this happen to them? Any idea what to do next? I'm not sure who to reach out to.

We're talking almost unprecedented. The only thing that could genuinely give a 17 year old a heart attack would be induced by drugs (for example Cocaine). Your EKG came back normal, good sign. I assume your blood work did as well. What they'd be looking at in your blood work is a protein called Troponin and whether or not it was elevated, which it wasn't, another good sign....Not trying to minimize your symptoms and what's going on. Just wanted to give a small background for a little peace of mind, in case you were still worried about a potential heart attack. Start by making an appointment with a general practitioner. Explain your symptoms, what you were doing when you were having the symptoms, etc. And you'll go from there hun. Good luck!!

Heart attack and Cardiac arrest can happen at any time , at any age. Especially if your family has congested heart disease history , the earlier the detection, the higher chance of prolonged life expectancy.

I ordered a stress test and nuclear imaging...they rushed me into surgery that same afternoon to clear two blockages and put in a stint. Keep pushing them. Order a stress test, you know you and you know if something is truly wrong. I'm one of last people anyone expected to have heart disease and it turns out I could have had a fatal heart attack at anytime.

5. u/Artistic_Cheetah_739 [score=3, created=2023-12-30T17:53:40]: Im sorry this is happening to you, Im 44 and going through similar things. Doctors just keep dismissing it after tests came back "normal"
6. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2023-02-23T00:32:28]: I’ve done the same as you and felt the same as you doctor told me the same things and everything but this was an e.r doctor they tend to just want you out and just say it’s anxiety does it still happen and when
