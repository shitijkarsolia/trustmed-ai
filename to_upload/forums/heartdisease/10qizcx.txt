Every second or third heart beat was a palpitation, i was driven to insanity and would cry in my bedroom. I did some research and started taking over the counter magnesium and potassium. My palpitations have now dissapeared. They have gone to getting them every single day for hours to maybe one or two palpitations every other day. Please give it a try if you are afraid of going through with medications

If it’s a rhythm issue like afib, that can be really dangerous because you’re at very high risk for clots and need to be on a blood thinner as well as an anti arrhythmic drug. Here are some Anti-arrhythmic drugs and their most common side effects: Metoprolol- most common and least SE. sleepiness (you can take at night to help that) it can drop your heart rate and BP Stotalol- it can be tricky because in some people it can mess with your rhythm and some doctors will make you start the med in the hospital to make sure your react to it properly. Amiodarone- very effective but long term on this med can cause a wide range of issues.
3. u/someguyouknow [score=2, created=2023-01-31T23:34:22]: Your doctor should be your first resource but beta blockers, specifically Metoprolol got rid of mine. Before that, I had some success staying really hydrated and taking magnesium.
4. u/FlamingoDingoRingo [score=2, created=2023-03-12T10:55:15]: I am on occasional beta blockers for it - they slow your heart rate and normalise it somewhat, but it's a very low dose and not permanent, only when they act up I come on and off them.

If you have a minute can you please tell me how to post here? I know how to get to the area to write my question but the "post" is grayed out. I would appreciate any help you can provide! Thank you.
6. u/RootsInThePavement [score=2, created=2024-05-18T04:56:27]: I was getting atrial tachycardia multiple times in 2022 (30 to 60 minute episodes, the highest my BPM went was 208) and my doctor put me on Metoprolol. It’s improved my life so much…beta blockers are used off-label for anxiety, so alongside stopping the arrhythmias it’s helped my anxiety disorder as well! I take 50mg a day. I recommend talking to your cardiologist and asking about options, especially if you feel you can’t do more meds. I understand the feeling, and a medical professional is the best person to ask.

8. u/Lillilegerdemain [score=1, created=2024-06-10T23:38:34]: When you say palpitations, do you mean AFIB? Heart-pounding episodes? I have had both and I was put on Amiodarone by my Cardio. Been 3 years now and I want to cut back;

11. u/Aggressive-House-555 [score=1, created=2025-03-12T17:32:40]: I'm on 100 mg metoprolol. it does not work at all for me. Just makes me so tired and doesn't decrease HR. but im also 22f and i will say i don't get out of breath as easy but thats it.
12. u/CantorWentMad [score=1, created=2025-05-13T04:37:04]: I get the idea of not wanting to rely on medications. The truth is though - that a proportion of people (myself among them) are born with hearts that don't work in a perfect way to live a long life. Cardiological medications have been proven to prolong life for those people. For palpitations, which are unsettling and could be symptomatic of something worse coming, beta-blockers work very well. They have some odd side effects (I found they made me feel... er... blase... about everything), but they basiclly work. With very little risk. And can prolong life. As someone who has had to take medications all my adult life, I understand that they are the only reason I am still alive. And the burden is surprisingly small. Everyone should make their own decisions about medications, but remember no one is 'normal'. Think about your medications. Look into risks and rewards of course, but please don't let the idea of being 'not normal' shorten your life.
13. u/thumos00 [score=1, created=2025-08-15T18:16:43]: palpitations is such a generic term. nobody likes taking BB or doing an holter test 2-3 times a year, but you need to know if it’s an arrhythmia or something less concerning. keep in mind that even just sinus tachycardia may have a negative effect if left untreated (contrary to paroxysmal issues which aren’t usually worrisome).
14. u/Never-Ending-77 [score=1, created=2025-09-01T09:02:21]: I take Propanolol 20 mg as needed. Works great, but can make me tired if I take more than 20 mg. Have you had a cardiac work-up?
