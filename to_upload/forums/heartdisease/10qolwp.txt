Given your history, regular check-ups and heart monitoring, like blood pressure checks and possibly an echocardiogram, are essential. Definitely consult your healthcare provider for personalized care. A heart-healthy diet typically includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. I’ve found that following the Mediterranean diet has worked well for me and helped improve my overall health. For exercise, moderate activities like walking or swimming are usually safe, but it's always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting something new. As for hydration, the "1 liter of water rule" is a good guideline, but remember to listen to your body’s needs. Staying proactive and informed is really important for heart health!
4. u/MyDoctorFriend [score=2, created=2025-11-13T19:55:14]: +1 to seeing a doctor (I’m an urgent care doc). While you’re waiting, feel free to try a tool I’ve built to help people preparing for a doctor visit. It’s called mydoctorfriend - you can learn more at about.mydoctorfriend.ai Again, this does NOT replace the need to see a doctor, but it may help guide you to the right kind of doctor and to prepare the right questions. There’s also askdocs here on Reddit.
5. u/OkCookie7180 [score=1, created=2024-10-28T00:51:13]: It sounds like you’re seeking guidance on managing your heart health, which is really important! Given your history, it’s essential to have regular check-ups with a cardiologist who can assess your condition and recommend personalized care, such as heart monitoring or medication if needed. For diet, focus on heart-healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (like fish and poultry), and healthy fats (like olive oil and avocados). Limit processed foods, sugar, and excessive sodium. As for activity, aim for moderate exercise like walking, swimming, or cycling for at least 150 minutes a week, but always consult your doctor before starting a new exercise program. The "1 Liter of Water" rule can be a good guideline, but individual hydration needs can vary. Generally, aim for about 2 liters (8 cups) of water daily, adjusting based on your activity level and climate. For home safety, consider things like fall prevention (clearing pathways, using non-slip mats), and if you have any specific heart concerns, ensure you have a plan in place for emergencies. It’s great that you’re proactive about your health!
