Title: Angina is a condition that affects the heart and can be very serious. It occurs when the heart doesn’t get enough oxygen and can lead to a heart attack. In some cases, angina can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes, but in other cases, surgery may be necessary.

2. u/Automatic-Layer-5191 [score=1, created=2022-11-26T00:28:30]: I ( 60m) have both angina and c a d , a heart cath. confirmed june 22. I have minimal blockage. My cardiologist prescribed a Staten, bp medicine, and aspirin. The only information i have ever, at all learned and honestly shocked to learn about my condition and heart desease was through my on reading and discovered through Google. A follow up appointment approximately three weeks after my cath. lasted about 4 minutes, he asked did i have anymore angina attacks ( i had a few) and simply said take my neds and he would see me again in six months. No guidance, no explanation of my condition, nothing. I had already read up on the basics and didnt ask any relevant questions as going in thought it would be explained in full. I think ive been to worried and scared to. My knowledge of heart desease was basically zero although its in my family, but for whatever uneducated, unknown reason i never thought it would happen to me. Its a shock, its scary, and life changing. I still get angina attacks, about 4 a week and the only way i know how to describe them is that it starts with pain in the back if my left upper arm, sometimes in my jaw and mouth and chest. A raw, hard , fatigue like sickness overwhelms me that last anywhere 2-3 minutes it seems and then i feel a relieved rush type feeling as i guess the blood releases, and its over. Its a very sick, scary, debilitating feeling and one thats dreaded when they occur. I am improving my diet, my exercises are limited as ive recently been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my knees, my right knee is unbearable at times, however thru a vitamin supplement that helps with inflammation and Tylenol im able to limp around for short periods of times. The left is not near as bad but know it's only a matter of time. Staying active and being able to exercise properly is a must i know, but this limits me tremendously. I do walk through the pain as best i can, but dont think its enough. A knee replacement im sure is coming. I am considering seeing a nutritionist as both deseases require a proper diet. Apologies for skipping around, just needed to post this and curious how others with angina and learning of there heart desease, how are you coping, what are your thoughts, feelings, advice?. If i sound like im feeling sorry for myself, im not, im a little out of sorts and scared a little, but its not a pity party, only a big surprise for lack of a better word. I am also surprised this sub doesn't get the numbers, with heart desease so common, who knows i guess. Thanks for reading, hope its helps someone and hope to hear your story. Take care!
