Hi, I have a resting heart rate of about 150bpm. My heart rate went up to 197bpm and I went to A&amp;E. They did a ecg, blood test and a chest X-ray. Blood test and chest X-ray came back fine, the ecg was fast, the doctor had me stand up to see if my heartrate went up which it did and the doctor said maybe pots. Does pots cause a very fast resting heart rate though? I got discharged and today my heart rate was 200+bpm. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Thanks.

You can do an internet search to see what some early studies have revealed about cannabis use and the effects on the heart.
