===============================================================================

Basically I went to the ER 2 months ago because I thought I was having a heart attack. They ran a ekg and bloodwork and said everything looked fine, and I more than likely pulled a muscle from my job. To this day I still have the same symptoms, chest pain that comes and goes, etc Would these 2 test they did pickup heart disease? I’ve become super paranoid about this lately and the anxiety it brings is probably making whatever it is even worse.

4. u/fundipandcandycigs [score=2, created=2022-11-20T19:49:24]: Let me just rule out this first, because it can strongly mimic what you're feeling: GERD / heartburn You mentioned it mainly happens at night when you lie down. Are you happening to eat a big or fatty meal and then laying down? That can definitely cause GERD, and people go to the ER all the time suspecting a heart attack, when it's just heartburn. An EKG isn't going to reveal heart disease, and the blood test you took was likely to test if you had a heart attack, by looking at your troponin levels. However, what they do reveal (in relation to heart disease) is your risk level. They would've told you if you were at high risk for heart disease. Your troponin levels would have been elevated enough to show that, and the EKG would reveal heart arrhythmia. Trust the doctors in that you're likely just fine, at least for right now. However: I have very early stage heart disease, and I'm 44, in probably the best shape of my life. My primary care doc said I was fine. I kept pushing and they did more tests and ordered an ultrasound done to check blood flow. Everything came back completely normal. My dad introduced me to his cardiologist and they did a stress test on me, which revealed something. So they did a CT scan with that contrast dye stuff and confirmed what was suspected. What's comforting to me is knowing that mine is completely genetic. My cardiologist said there's nothing I did (or can do) to cause this. I'm fit, I go mountain biking, my blood pressure and heart rate are really good, and I'm at the gym usually 5x/week. I eat a healthyish diet; I don't do fried or greasy/fatty foods at all, but I do have a sweet tooth.

6. u/keyser1884 [score=1, created=2022-11-20T23:50:01]: No it would not. I had the same (plus a chest x-ray) and it did not show anything. Exercise stress test was also clear. It took a MIBI (nuclear stress test) to find heart disease. I’m awaiting a CT Angiogram to determine the extent of the issue though.
