===============================================================================

I have some sort of tachycardia and am getting the holtar monitor soon. What can I expect? I had really bad periods so I’m on birth control to not have them. I have vertigo (was worse during pms) and migraines. Asthma. Am a healthy weight but exercise is hell. I was cleared to have caffeine/alc since neither affected my condition.

1. u/lfslshlps [score=2, created=2022-11-24T07:18:55]: Haven't had a holter in a few years, but have had them since I was a child (way back when they were the size of a large walkman and had a tape). They will let you know how long the device will be attached to you, and provide body cleansing instructions. If you have sensitive skin, let them know as they can use hypoallergenic stickers. This device is fairly small now, and you essentially go about your life but have a device attached. Previous tests they've given me a notebook to keep a log of any irregular rhythms I feel, or stressors - but this isn't often. They will provide any restrictions you may have at the time of application. Ideally they get a recording of your every day functions. Adjusting your life and adding restrictions, that the doctor doesn't outright provide to you, can skew your results because it's not going to provide a true count of how your hard is handling everything. I know this feels like something you have to do, but you don't want the results to be inconclusive, then you have to redo the test all over again. Also! Ask if there is a Holter drop off box for when it's all done. When I was younger you had to go to the hospital, go to the Holter lab, get a test room, and take almost an hour removing all the tape and wires (at the time they used to add A LOT of tape). Now, you typically remove it at home and drop it off. Some hospitals offer a drop off mailbox, so you can literally just swing by the entrance, drop off the Holter and leave without having to park, go in, etc.
