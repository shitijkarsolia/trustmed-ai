===============================================================================

My doctor is away for awhile and I just got the results back and I’ve sent this question to him as well but would like to hear from others. I had my echo done earlier this week and everything seemed to come back normal except my right ventricle was noted as “moderately dilated” so I am wondering what that might mean? My EF was 55-60%. The part where it says “RV ID, ED, PLAX” says 4.8cm. Would really appreciate to interpretation on this. I originally got seen for weird heart palpitations and diagnosed with SVT.

As the muscle thickens, it becomes more difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs....doesn't necessarily mean a big issue but they might want to test your lungs. Are you a smoker?

There’s a lot of different causes and hard to say what causes yours with out knowing more or seeing the images. As long as it’s not severe you can wait until your doctor comes back to talk more with them
