Waking up and feeling left pain and heart pounding and a bit nauseated As everyone knows I been to the hospital few times just because I get feelings as if I’m having heart issues and they did heart blood test. EKGs and so on so many times. Last time was maybe 3 weeks ago. Last 3 days I actually had to go to the ET for stomach issues and they said it can be cancer then the new 2 days I did bunch of testing and it all came normal and was let go home but still have to get a colonoscopy done. Came home today at 6pm went to bed so tired at 8pm and just now woke up at 1am while waking up I had this left pain and my heart pounding hard and im having the feeling now. Heart rate at 58-66bpm feels a bit stronger and I feel sick like I’m going to vomit and sweaty hands. I just called the ER they came. Did a ekg fast. I threw up. Heart rate was 75bpm. They asked me few questions. Said most likely panic attack and chose not to go to the ER they told me to choose 3 hospital and the shortest wait is 11 hours and choose to stay. Idk what to do. I’m scared. I took my anxiety medicine.

I have health anxiety and always worry about my heart and I notice when I focus on it more than the problems tend to manifest themselves more. I too have had stomach issues. Usually acid reflux and heart palpations. But i noticed my acid reflux completely went away when i controlled my anxiety. I still get pains on my left side of my chest sometimes that come on for a few seconds then go away which makes me check my blood pressure and i usually find it around 140/80, as I calm down my blood pressure drops. I say all of this to tell you to trust the doctors. im not sure what tests they have done but if they checked you out then you need to trust them and relax. If you go for a run and notice chest pains or shortness of breath then i would be concerned but if your only getting these issues at rest and not when working out i dont see how it could be heart related. I take zoloft and find it calms my mind but i still struggle with health anxiety. heart palpations also scare me but every test they have done on me has came back clean also. its a daily battle but know your not alone and just take a deep breath and try and relax. heart issues do not come and go a bad heart would give you issues when you are working out and you would have symptoms all the time. sweaty palms, palpations, stomach issues can all be caused by anxiety. give the medication time to kick in and see how you feel in a few months. im not a doctor tho so please dont take my advice as such but if the doctors are telling you you are fine then you probably are. if you are really worried about it see if they will do a calcium score test and that can see if you have blockage in your heart or not. i wish the best for you and kow your not alone.
