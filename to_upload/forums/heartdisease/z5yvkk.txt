37 yr old male with 25.5 BMI September last week this year I rushed to ER as am feeling tightness in chest and high heart rate. BP at check in was 157/123 so they took me into ER blood electrolytes , troponin and chest X-ray were taken and everything came normal. I was sent back to follow up with my PCP about future course of action. He prescribed cardiac stress test (treadmill) which I took just yesterday and waiting for results. Meanwhile in my trip to parent country got evaluated by a cardiologist and my VMR spot test, bilateral renal artery Doppler and cardiac 2D echo tests were performed and came back normal. He prescribed bisoprolol and amaldopine 2.5 mg and suggested to take one tablet a day as long as I notice my bp with systolic above 140 and diastolic above 90.my resting heart rate is usually between 90-100. Bp is 140/90 to 160/100. If I took tablet it gets normal and then it’s back again .. What could be the issue ? Historically I used some tablets to last longer during sex and also occasionally used poppers.regular gym rat with good fitness till pandemic started later on lost fitness . Has sleep apnea for quite some years now

You're on a low dosage of amlodipine, so if you are consistently having high blood, you're better off taking the medication daily to keep your blood pressure in the healthier range for your body to learn to reset. If your bp goes below 100/65, have some salt to increase to healthier level.
