===============================================================================

I had a stress test done a couple of weeks ago and finally heard from my doctor today that she's referring me to a cardiologist because they saw changes in my ECG during it. I know I shouldn't google my symptoms but of course I did and saw it likely means CAD. My doctor didn't give me any other information about the risks of this or if I should do or not do anything while waiting for a cardiology appointment. I'm already dieting, exercising, cutting out salt, and drinking only water. Any other suggestions or words of wisdom to set my mind at ease?
