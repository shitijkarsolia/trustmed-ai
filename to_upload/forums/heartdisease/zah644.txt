M 45, 145lb... Hi for what ever reason I get significant chest discomfort and elevated heart rate for days after using any type of vasodikator. Its actually 4:00 am now as my body won't let me sleep. Little embarrassing but Its been 3 days since I used a laser comb for a few minutes to treat my hairloss. My heart always responds this way if I try the laser comb or minoxidil, even in super low dose. I had an echo done a few years ago and I had mild valve leakage, mild wall thickening in right ventricle, mild enlarged right ventricle and a couple other mild type things. I don't smoke and am slender. I get fatigued very easily when my heart acts up like this and I can't sleep. Doctor wants me to get another echo and I'm sure the symptoms will fade by the time the appointment arises. Should I use the laser comb the day before testing to show what occurs when I use it? I dont think its a normal response that my heart gives to these things. Or should I abstain from it and run the risk of my cardiologist saying to do nothing as I have a bunch of mild things going on? Thanks any feedbackbos most appreciated!

This is listed as a rare side effect that could be dangerous. If your heart rate is high or you are having arrhythmia or chest pain you should probably go to ER.
