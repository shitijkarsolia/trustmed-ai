I am 14 and i was diagnosed with a third degree heart block after 3 months of going in and out of different hospitals. It doesn’t sound like it’s a third degree but maybe a one or two. I also thought it was anxiety before till i started getting dizzy at school and i lost consciousness a few times and they had to call n ambulance because severe heart pain. I would definitely get is checked out with a 24-hour holter test and an ECG, and u can always reach out to me if u want more information
