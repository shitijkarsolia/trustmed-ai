Title: SVT was misdiagnosed as anxiety/panic attacks for years. I'm afraid it's hurt my heart. Anyone with SVT, how long did you go before they finally caught in on EKG? Will I be the same again?

===============================================================================

I'm a female 30 years old. I pretty suddenly about 5 years ago started getting these extremely fast heart racing episodes (thought it was panic attacks induced from smoking pot, because it started happening everytime I smoked, even though I was a long time 10+ years pot smoker at that point and never had SVT episodes before) and around the same time I actually suffered a concussion. This concussion was also misdiagnosed at first as panic attacks/ anxiety, even psychosis (I thought I was going crazy, feelings I had was never like anything I've felt before and they really sucked, I even quit my job at the time because I just couldn't even see straight) until I convinced a Dr to give me an MRI and CT scan of my brain, which resulted in evidence my brain was healing from a concussion, a week and a half after the fact. During the concussion my svt episodes became worse (still thought it was anxiety/panic attacks so didn't call 911) but I was able to get them to stop after learning how to on my own (bearing down/trying to take deep breaths and holding them slightly) until it became harder and harder to rid them. After 2 1/2 weeks, I woke up one day finally feeling normal out of nowhere. It was like a miracle. Except svt episodes still occured. Still thinking it was just panic attacks, I thought really nothing of it. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I got an episode I couldn't stop. This scared me so much, I was in svt for about 30 mins and called EMT, telling them I couldn't get my "heart palpitations" to stop. I originally thought they were heart palpitations caused by anxiety (cause that's what they always told me) until the EKG of 230 bpm proved otherwise and paramedics said I'll probably have to be on heart meds or have ablation. This is where I learned svt was even a thing. They had to shoot me with adenasine 3 times to get it to stop (6mg, 12mg and 12mg) and that was so dreadfully scary, but also relieved when it stopped... Weirdest feeling ever. They asked if I had a history of anxiety, which I do, and said this is why it was misdiagnosed for years. I realize now I've had countless episodes. It used to be a few times a week, sometimes I'd go a week or 2 without episodes, but never a full month I don't think. I guesstimate about 50+ svt attacks in the last 5 years. It got to the point where I can't do any cardio excersize without an episode. Chest pains that I thought was anxiety, was probably angina this whole time, and it's happened a lot. I'm seeing a cardiologist for my first time on the 13th (soonest appt I can get thanks Kaiser) and my primary put me on propranolol 10mg twice a day and still get flutters almost everyday. Thinking about taking it three times a day now. I was 3 weeks without an episode until the other night, caused by me simply riding my shopping cart to my car like a skateboard (I know silly something I've always done tho) and it's crazy that just that short and very little of excersize was enough to set it off. I didn't have my medication on me, and home was 30 mins away, and even tho I wasn't really in full svt, perhaps from the propranolol (maybe 150 bpm as opposed to 230 bpm that was recorded on EKG before) I was still about to have a bout and my anxiety was thru the roof. I took my propranolol as soon as I got thru the door and called 911, and thankfully it subsided as the paramedics got to me. They did an EKG to make sure (I was at 98bpm but irregular beat) and 10 minutes later I was back to regular heartbeat and 80 bpm, blood pressure was a bit high though (140/something) I quit cigs (smoked since I was 17), pot (smoked since I was 15) and even coffee, I used to drink about 2 cups everyday for years. I pretty much quit all cold turkey just from being scared of SVT. My grandma died at 68 of a heart attack (probably from smoking cigs, which did a toll her to after she beat breast cancer not long before I'm sure) and my dad died 2 1/2 years ago from a heart attack as well, but he didn't smoke cigs for more than 10 years of his life (quit when he was 30), he was 59 when he died. He was a chronic pot smoker his whole life however and hbp but refused to take meds (as a pharmacy tech now, I'm mad at myself for not making him take his meds, as they might have saved his life). I don't know if I'm just ranting at this point, or really want to try and find someone I can relate with on this matter and if my heart might heal. Will I ever dance again? I love dancing but I'm so afraid of SVT now. Will ablation be my only option? I actually really want it, the propranolol gives me horrible vivid dreams every single night, but will doctor just keep trying different meds until I don't get episodes anymore? The thing is, I don't wan to "wait and see", I want ablation more than meds but afraid doctor will just try everything before ablation is on the table. Is having 50+ svt episodes enough to consider me for ablation? I know most say svt is benign but I'm afraid it's not in me... My heart feels weaker than ever and I'm only 30. Has anyone had this many episodes and are fine now? I really need to know... Edit March 10 2023 (original post was I believe mid-end November 2022: since I've had a few people ask I should let everyone know I actually ended up getting heart ablation on February 7th 2023. It was a very weird and nerve-wracking operation since you're awake, but they sedated me enough to feel less nervous. You do feel burning in your chest when they do the ablation (in my case multiple times to get the whole spot) but it was bearable. They had to go in both my groin vessels in my case, I guess mine was a hard to reach spot or "tricky" as the doctor put it. I was on metoprolol for about 2 months (switched from propranolol after I saw my cardiologist after I posted this), from when I was officially diagnosed to my ablation, and although it did help I did have 2 episodes in those months but I was able to get them to stop after taking an extra dose of metoprolol, although it took about 15-20 minutes for it to kick in and stop it. I got my echocardiogram and ablation appointment set the same day I saw my cardiologist, they basically recommended it right away because of how many episodes I have had. Even though Kaiser is usually a slow process I'm very happy I went from diagnosed to ablation in just about 3 months with only 2 episodes in between. It's now been a little over a month since the ablation and I'm happy to say I'm SVT free, besides the few 1 second flutters but that's apparently totally normal as the heart tissue heals, and those are happening less often now. I stopped taking the metoprolol after the ablation, per doctors orders, probably to see if the ablation actually worked. It's so nice to not have an episode for a month and I'm rly grateful I did it. It did cost me about 6k in the end from my deductible but the whole operation alone is about 30k, at least with Kaiser, but for me is totally worth it as I'm just so relieved now. Fingers crossed cause they do say the heart tissue healing takes about 3 months, so I'm still in what they call a "blanking" period to see if it was successful or not. But I'm already getting the feeling it worked, like they say it does about 90-95% of the time. Hope this helps someone who is also looking into ablation, especially if you had like 2-5 episodes a month like I did, I would recommend it. Edit May 2023: still SVT free and I feel great. Gotta say my anxiety has since gotten better also, before I would never have gone 3 months without an episode since 2018 when it first started happening, even tho I thought they were panic attacks back then. I feel like I'm free again to do whatever I want and go wherever without the fear of having an episode and being pumped with adenosine again. I still get the once in a while flutter but it only happens for a beat, and then it's like the ablation completely keeps the SVT from happening. I strongly recommend ablation if SVT controls your life and medication isn't working as good as it used to.

This is a permanent scarring to your heart that permanently changes your heart's electrical regulation. There is also risk of heart attack, stroke, and death with the ablation procedure. Continue seeing your doctors. If you don't like the ones you have, try and get other ones. Ask if they can monitor you over a 24 hour day so they can capture the heart arrhythmia you are describing. They should be doing ECG's and blood tests at the very least. I wish you all the best and good health.

I wore a holter monitor, the other day but didn’t have an episode with it on. I did have one the day before, highest my heart went is about 140. How would I know the difference between SVT and a panic attack? My episodes only last one to two minutes and then go away on their own.

5. u/wastelands33 [score=1, created=2025-04-30T11:47:00]: How to say this and use this as something to help with the anxiety you have. At least know now that you have a actual diagnosis and you're not living with something that you thought was making you go crazy. I know that doesn't help the problem with actually having SVT but just know now you are being taken care of as not of before since they didn't diagnose it or find it at the time.
