Hi Reddit Wouldn't normally go to a forum for medical advice but I'm a bit stumped as to what is wrong with me and what best course of action is. I'm 36 and, to my knowledge, fit and healthy however have a history of recreational drug use, particularly relevant being ketamine and cocaine. I don't smoke and I'm not an especially heavy drinker. 2 months or so ago I noticed I was getting irregular heart beats when doing intense exercise and when partying. They went away quickly and I didn't dwell on it. However I had one 'episode' where it lasted a whole evening which was quite scary. My heart wasn't going especially fast, just skipping beats and it felt very floppy or loose, and generally seemed weak. I should have gone to hospital in hindsight but went to bed and it went back to normal next day, however I had a tight strained feeling in my chest for days afterwards. This feeling seems to improve when I exercise (although being careful not to push myself too hard). It went away and I felt normal then I got irregular beats again doing weights. This time they went away quite fast but the strained feeling came back that day and stayed with me 10 days or so, improving each day. It's a 3 out of 10 in terms of pain/discomfort but definitely noticeable. Top left side of chest. I've been to doctor and also cardiologist. ECG came back fine but of course if they don't catch the arrhythmia in action then it's tricky. I had blood tests and they listened to my heart and they said all seems fine. However something is clearly wrong here. It feels like controlled cardio is good for it and the threshold for which it flips in to arrhythmia can be built up if I keep exercising. But if I push it too hard it comes back and then it seems to come back more easily. I'm worried that these irregular beats and weakening of damaging my heart. Neither doctor was able to explain the strained feeling and almost insinuating it's in my head. What I'm feeling is not in my head, it's way to pronounced and there's definitely a correlation between it and the irregular beats. I've bought a fitbit charge 5 and hoping to catch the irregular beats next time they happen. But I also don't want to make them happen as I suffer for days afterwards. I believe the doctor is going to get me one I can wear for 24 hours but same issue, need the irregular bears to occur in that time frame. My current plan is to keep exercising and go with my intuition and build up resilience and try and make it go away if that's even possible. I'd love to know if anyone has had a similar experience. For the record I've not taken any drugs since it became apparent this is potentially serious and I'm drinking very little alcohol, a couple of small drinks a week, if that.
