===============================================================================

So basically at one point in my life I was extremely obsessed with losing weight and just having a general addiction to the gym. One day I idiotically decided to take a fat burning supplement that contained a herb called ephedra which contains ephedrine. The first day I took it I immediately felt extreme cold sweats and a fast paced heart rate yet it seemed to wear off around 10 mins later so I shrugged it off and seemed it to be anxiety related as I was already anxious to take the pill. The next time I took it was a couple of days later at half the dosage and everything seemed fine at first until towards the end of my workout when everything went wrong. While walking on the treadmill I felt the sensation of my heart dropping to my stomach and immediately got very cold and a very fast heart rate. I tried to calm myself down as my friend has been taking the full dosage for around a week now with no symptoms. My symptoms seemed to not go away as panic set in for me and I began to realize I needed medical attention. I was rushed to the nearest hospital and described what I took. They did a ECG and a blood test for Troponin however both seemed normal and I was sent back home. I was extremely nauseous and on edge yet nothing too serious. The next day towards the night I got the same similar heart drop feeling and was rushed again just to have all tests seem normal again. The doctor stated that I was an adverse reaction to the herb and my body was trying to get rid of it by sweating it out. The next couple Of days I felt horrible and couldn’t get myself to eat I was shaky and nauseous. I booked an appointment with a cardiologist and did every test possible. The echo came back seemingly normal yet with an extremely low amount of LVH (left ventricle hypertrophy) deemed within the normal range by other doctors. I still felt palpations and a weird heart rate so we did a holster test a couple days later just for it to also come back normal. The doctor claimed I was healthy and fine and just to relax and take the medications he asked me to. I was given concor (beta blocker) with a 1.25mg daily dose (very small) and anti depressants just for my anxiety. Things seemed to get better however I was still scarred to death reading about all the adverse affect people my age would experience such as sudden death and permanent disabilities. I would also experience small chest pinches and chest pain for a couple of seconds that didn’t get worse with breathing or laying down. Weeks later everything seemed to be going back to normal however caffine and nicotine would Make me a bit anxious yet I seemed fine this lasted a month or two. Towards that time I began my first year of uni and traveled overseas. During my time there everything was fine and I was extremely happy with going back to my normal life yet a couples of weeks later I got this huge sense of dizziness that seemed life threading sort of. This dizziness would only be resolved by making myself full or eating consistently yet I still experienced a crazy amount of brain fog. I scared myself with some more research and found that the anti-depressant I was taking (escitalopram, cipralix) has a small chance of causing arrhythmias and QT wave prolongnations in the heart. I spoke to my doctor about this and he said that I could stop taking it if I wanted to and everything seemed fine so I tried stopping. After doing so I would take it every two days or so to slowly stop the dose but once I took it I would get the same heart dropping cold sweat feeling I got beforehand and I could never take it again since then. I got severe depression for a while just randomly crying for no reason but the faded away. Doctor also noted that since all tests were negative there was no reason for me to take concor anymore except if I felt anxious. after stopping all of my meds, I started getting this chest pain and extreme anxiety again and with my parents across the sea I started to panic. I eneded up losing a term of university and going back home to run some medical tests and be near my parents for the time. I was at the worst state of my life always crying and feel chest pain accompanied by regular symtomps of heart attacks such as back in pain and pain in arms however they would come and go as they please and sometimes separate from each other. I begged for another echocardiogram and had another one done which I sent to several cardiologist and they all deemed my symomtps to be anxiety related and they stated that’s several teenagers are reporting similar chest pains after the vaccine with no explanation. The last thing we could have possibly checked was my arteries and I did a CT coronary scan with a contrast dye. Everything once again seemed normal and there were no signs of any inflammation. Yet the chest pain and occasional Dizziness still remained and I was sick of hearing that it was anxiety based. I also had somewhat above high average creatinine levels (accompanied by kidney pain) however after drinking a good amount of water my levels went down from 1.19 to 0.97. Now I have no idea what to do. I always fear the chance that doctors may have misdiagnosed me and I have a huge constant fear for my health. I know I am very young for this to happen but the fact that I took the supplements is causing me to think that this has something to do with it. A doctor told me that since I took the pill months ago and done all the related tests it would be too late for something new to occur since then. I realized that a lot of this happend after I stopped my anti-depressant but now I am horrified of taking any SSRI’s because of their potential heart risks and I still fear something very wrong is happening. I have been prescribed a new different type of beta blocker called propanol for anxiety and rescued heart rate but it’s giving me this sense of my heart burning and after I take it I find it hard to breathe for a couple minutes before it goes away. What do you guys think? I have not been able to live normally in forever and always panic and overthink that I may suddenly die the next day. For general information I am 18 years old and used to be very athletic. I took the pill in august and it’s now december. I she ran these tests throughout the months since.

When it is irritated it can cause many of the symptoms you are listing. Anxiety, heart palpitations, dizziness etc. Perhaps it is possible that when you took the ephedra it knocked that system out of balance. Look it up and talk to your doctor if it seems like this sounds like what you are experiencing. There are treatments and exercises that can get it back in balance.
