===============================================================================

I know I need to take it because I just had quadruple bypass surgery, but this pill makes me feel like crap. It gives me this dizziness that throws me off and I can't do anything while it's going on. Will they ever taper the dose down to nothing at some point? Or is it for life? I really don't want to take it if it makes me dizzy. That's a shitty way to live, not to mention work.

I had no idea it was this medication until I got home and was off of ot for one day . Pain came back as soon as I took it. Called the cardiologist and have not taken it since . No replacement was offered and I did not request one. Talk to your doctor .

It was hell for 6 weeks. Then changed to something more palatable. Tell your doctor about the side effects and that you want to try something else.

Definitely talk to your doc about adjusting the dose or changing all together. Maybe take your bp when your symptoms happen so you can show them. For me, some of the other side effects went away after several months and it was a very good medication that kept me active. Everyone is different though. Good luck to you.

One of my meds is a beta blocker, I hate it because the side effects are so extreme. Everything from depression to constipation, all at extreme levels. They've raised my statin from 10-30mg per day and that comes with more side effects. I received 3 stents that took my multiple blockages from 99%, 80%,80% to 0% all on the he left branch. My right branch still has an 80% but I guess that's not as big of a deal. My question is do I need to take these poisons that make me feel terrible and have incredible abdominal cramping and constipation, actually to the point that I passed out before I understood what was happening, or is there another way. I normally wake up happy clearheaded great attitude and out look on life, enjoy my work. Do I follow the course they've told me must or?
