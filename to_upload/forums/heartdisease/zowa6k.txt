===============================================================================

I had a heart attack and quad bypass surgery back in mid September. I've been having incidents of motion sickness since mid October. I've had some general nausea, but I've especially been getting motion sick. I've got my meds list below, if any of you think one of them is likely the culprit. atorvatatin 80 MG 1/day PM clopidogrel 75 MG 1/day AM diltiazem 120 MG ER 1/day AM metoprolol tartrate 12.5 MG 2/day AM &amp; PM lisinopril 2.5 MG 1/day AM I'm trying to figure out if one of them could be causing it, and see if alternatives are out there, or if I just need to live with this. Thanks!
