===============================================================================

i have couplets and i feel them they are fast. so it might be short coupled PVC/PAC which is a horrible feeling and i know it can send me in VT or VF and cardiac arrest or death….. i been cleared by 3 cardiologists in the past 6 months since my ectopics started to go really bad but i feel like it can change and i can die… they let me go without treatment because my highest burden was 6% and i have a very strong structurally healthy heart… but how i can overcome if i know that i could still die from not the ectopic itself but the ectopic can trigger something that is fatal……? im literally going crazy right now when i feel these horrible ectopics in a row… it feels like my whole chest vibrating and im scared as hell
