===============================================================================

I started going to a cardiologist for a random chest pain that ultimately turned out to be nothing. However, my calcium score was discovered to be 6.94. I thought this was ok but apparently it’s very bad for a 43yrF. I’m being put on statins to get my cholesterol from 155 to 50 and have been asked to monitor my blood pressure to get a baseline. Earlier this year my BP was hovering around 119/80..120/85..but now it’s up to 134/89. This is all in a matter of months. How reversible is this? How quickly? Admittedly I’ve been extra lazy lately because I’ve basically been getting a cold every few months with everything going around. I planned to start being active again anyway as soon as I felt better. Will they be able to see that if my cholesterol comes down or will it all be attributed to the meds?

Of course, zero is optimal, but your cholesterol and bp is fine too. Your total cholesterol is only 155? Or ldl 155? You can improve your numbers through diet and exercise. Your worrying is probably not helping. Relax, you got this!

And most cholesterol tests don't distinguish between those two. The calcium score would be a more useful metric to go by I think. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.

The damage has been done, and your cardiologist should have you on a treatment plan to slow down the process. For me, my calcium score came in at a 1. I went in to see my GP for something I thought was unrelated, and he referred me to a cardiologist, who tested me pretty extensively. He found something after a stress test, then did further testing which verified my heart disease. As for "treatment", I'm on Crestor (statin) and baby aspirin for life, and was told that I needed to focus hardcore on losing weight (I was 239 at the time, and now I'm at 205; he originally told me he wanted me at 200 lbs). As for diet, the usual advice to avoid processed foods, greasy foods, fried foods, eat more fruits and veggies, etc. All of this happened this year.

I’m still in shock from being diagnosed with first Afib and then CAD with moderate stenosis In my LAD and mild in the same vessel and mild in my circumflex. It sounds to me that yours has been caught even earlier than that ? But I do know it sucks being hit young with this stuff. I’ve been struggling with my own diagnosis and I have been helped by some good people on here and other heart forums. Healthunlocked.com is really great. Sad and scared totally know what that feels like ! I’m sure you will get some good advice on here and if not go to the forum I mentioned it has people all over the world on it even if the British heart foundation group on there is British mainly. As people have told me better to know now and sounds like it’s super early diagnosis sounds all mild rather than moderate or severe. Good luck. Edit: I just looked up your score. You’ve been given a huge huge second chance here. I would say you have nothing to worry about as long as you address diet and exercise and take a low statin. My score is probably more around 300 and I’m 47.
