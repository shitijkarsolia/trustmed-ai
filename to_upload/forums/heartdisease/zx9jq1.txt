===============================================================================

I just have a long family history of heart disease. My dad his uncles and some of his cousins unfortunately passed from it. All of them barely made it into their 50s. My dad had the worst case and passed at 44 with a very diseased heart… I myself have high blood pressure already and im 24.. thinking about seeing a cardiologist.

I was completely unaware of my family history until I was diagnosed. It skipped my father‘s generation, but his mother and her father had major issues with heart disease. My grandmother had a heart attack at 40. If you’re aware of this heredity factor you should most definitely see a cardiologist. I was diagnosed after having what I thought was a heart attack and having to visit the ER. I was only 38 and I’m an average weight, seemingly healthy female. I’m just thankful that they took me seriously. As a younger woman you get dismissed a lot when it comes to your concerns. I was given a CT scan with contrast. They also gave me medication to slow my heart while they did the CT scan so they could see better. I was also given an echo. I have to say it is pretty neat to watch your own heartbeat during the echo. Thankfully it has been caught early and I was put on something for my cholesterol and my high blood pressure. Later I was sent to the cardiologist and I was given a stress test, which thankfully I passed. Catch it early and hopefully you can keep it in check. Putting it off only makes things worse.

Something I often think of when hearing about heart disease running in families is perhaps a genetic heart defect or a mutation that makes one genetically predisposed to heart defects. My grandfather died of an aortic aneurysm in his early 40s. My father has some heart issues and has always had a murmur. My cousin has multiple congenital heart defects, as do I. If my cousin and I hadn't needed NICU stays when we were born, I think the defects would have gone unnoticed for a while. It doesn't hurt to go to a cardiologist, get an EKG and an echo. If you're having symptoms perhaps push for something more if your echo and EKG are good.

A nuclear stress test and cardiac catheritization was used for the diagnosis.
5. u/-Apocralypse- [score=1, created=2023-01-15T15:19:30]: A rather easy way to check for heart disease is to have your BNP levels checked in your blood. BNP is the stress hormone of the heart itself. It raises when the heart is experiencing stress. As troponine is only elevated when the heart is already damaged, BNP seems more logical when doing preventive checks.
