===============================================================================

So I’ve had 2 ecgs and this feeling used to happen every day a couple months ago. Doctors said it’s nothing but this feeling just came back today. It feels like a short punch to the middle of the chest and then it goes away. I don’t get any other pain besides that but I used to get short pains in my chest but they’re also gone. I’m gonna speak to my doctor this week to hopefully get a heart monitor to see what’s going on. I’m not looking for real medical advice ofc I’m gonna see a doctor but does anyone have any clue what this could be ?
