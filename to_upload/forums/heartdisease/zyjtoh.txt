Hi, im Bente and i am a 16 year old diagnosed with a third degree AV- block, also known as a complete heartblock. I am getting a pacemaker surgery the week after new years. I am planning to take ecstasy on new years with my friends. I know what the effects are and that it can effect ur heart, i was wondering if its less safe to use ecstasy? I smoke a ton and my heart always seems to handle it pretty well. But my final question is, can i take ecstasy without having big problems while or after taking the drug?

3. u/[deleted] [score=3, created=2022-12-29T17:31:49]: Don’t listen to the guy saying 1 time won’t do anything because it will. It literally will. Even one time drugs can cause heart issues if you have underlying issues. Do not do it.

5. u/TheRandomestWonderer [score=3, created=2022-12-29T20:40:27]: You’re heart is already working over time to keep you alive, don’t chance it by making it work harder! Stop smoking also! Do you have a death wish?
6. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2023-01-01T08:56:28]: Do not take ecstasy. People have died from this drug from just one dose. It is a gamble, you do not know the potency, you do not know if they mixed other drugs and amphetamines with it.
7. u/Hobo__Joe [score=2, created=2022-12-29T17:15:23]: One night of ecstasy isn't going to have a huge impact on your heart. Continued, regular use would have an impact. That said, **stop smoking**. I can't say that strongly enough. Smoking "a ton" or even less than a ton **WILL** kill you, especially with your heart issues.
