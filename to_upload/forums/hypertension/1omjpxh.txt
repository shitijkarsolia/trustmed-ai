===============================================================================

Good evening everyone Tuesday the 28th in the night around 2:30 a.m. I went to the emergency room in my city after a very high blood pressure measurement. Arrived at the emergency room the nurse measures 16/11 above my sweater I spend the night there until 10 a.m. with measurements every 15 minutes and blood tests for cardiac markers and ECG Result everything is perfectly normal and the tension stabilizes around 14/8 13/8 I am sent home and asked for a 3-day self-measurement which gives the attached results I would like to point out that I suffer from generalized anxiety. I felt much better until last night when my blood pressure rose again to reach 147/92 I didn't sleep all night because of this. Has anyone encountered this problem before? How to overcome it? In addition to anxiety, I suffer from around fifteen kg of excess weight. Thank you very much for reading

Look at vitamin D first. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &lt;50 nmol/L or 20 ng/mL) is common in Europe and the Middle East. It occurs in &lt;20% of the population in Northern Europe, in 30-60% in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe and up to 80% in Middle East countries. Severe deficiency (serum 25(OH)D &lt;30 nmol/L or 12 ng/mL) is found in &gt;10% of Europeans. a connection exists between iodine intake and heart palpitations, Mild iodine deficiency remains common across the WHO European region.
