Hey all so I’m not new to meds but I feel like since I started hypertension meds (2022) I psychologically give myself anxiety about it lol. Every day when I take my pill I think I can feel it lowering my pulse and I can feel it affecting me but I do think it’s in my head. I can think my heart is racing and then it starts racing but when I’m busy enjoy things I don’t feel any thing lol. I honestly think if I didn’t take a med or dealt with blood pressure I’d be normal again. Anyone else feel this way? I’ve tried anxiety meds two different kinds and they aren’t for me either. I just feel like my body/mind doesn’t like pills messing with it.

But somehow Ive convinced myself that the high bp was also anxiety.. and now that Im on meds when my bp is ok, it reinforces that. Anxiety + BP is a nightmare to live with
