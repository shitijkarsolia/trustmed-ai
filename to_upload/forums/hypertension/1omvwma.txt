===============================================================================

Does anyone have a recommendation for a home blood pressure machine? I have an old Sinocare brand one and I really hate it. Even if I leave a space of two fingers between the cuff and my arm, it squeezes the hell out of me so much that it leaves red marks (bruising) on my arm and it hurts so much. Which must be raising my blood pressure! I was at the pharmacy today and I took my reading on their machine and it was so comfortable. And my reading was so much better! Looking for comfort and accuracy. Thanks!

I had a wrist cuff I have used for years, and we tested it against his BP tester in the office and they were the same but he says that usually they aren't as accurate.
