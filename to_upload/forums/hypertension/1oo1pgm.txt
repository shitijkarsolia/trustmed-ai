===============================================================================

31 year old female. About a year ago I decided to check my blood pressure and to my surprise it was super high. I was leading an extremely unhealthy lifestyle(drinking allot and vaping). I went to the doctor and got prescribed 15mg of BP meds plus beta blockers. I started walking and intermittent fasting. 6 months of taking the meds I quit them cold turkey (not recommended ) because they made me develop such a nasty cough. Anyway about a year later now and I am not on meds, I have gone from 82kg to 75kg and the goal is 60kg. I am just posting this for anyone that might be in a similar boat, it is possible to be healthy again .

6. u/Clairefun [score=3, created=2025-11-04T03:08:10]: Good stuff - for many people, lifestyle changes can make a really big difference - though we definitely never recommend stopping meds without doctor's advice, or going cold turkey. Your lifestyle changes worked quickly - for many people, it's pretty slow to take effect, so meds in the meantime is the safest idea for many. Congratulations on the changes, though, and a huge well done on your hard work!

For anyone in the same boat, I found this resource (from a nurse practitioner!) super useful for breaking down the basics about blood pressure and making high blood pressure less scary/intimidating for me.
