EDIT: This is my question. Does anyone here who is on meds for blood pressure have a prescription that says "take one tablet a day, but on days that you feel anxious or your BP is reading higher, take two"? This is how my PCP wants me to manage some recent BP spikes / higher readings. I have never heard of using BP meds that way - I thought the idea was to take the same amount at the same time every day in order to keep the medication consistent in your bloodstream - and I'm trying to decide whether to comply or to get a second opinion from a different doctor. Please share your experience if you have any that relate. Thank you! TLDR version: First, some background and the story that leads to my post. 62YO female, diagnosed with hypertension in Nov. 2024. PCP started me on 50 mg of daily Losartan-HCTZ at that time. Other than some fluctuating BP readings the first couple of weeks, BP quickly stabilized and my weekly morning readings have been in a consistently good range for the past year: typically, around 110/70 on the average. In addition, I have improved my diet and increased my exercise, losing roughly 20 pounds in the process so that I'm now in the high end of a "normal" weight range for my height. The story is that everything was going well until a couple of days ago. Out of the blue, while I was sitting quietly and working on the computer, I got a late afternoon nosebleed. Nothing to be alarmed about except I really have \*never\* had one, so it did scare me. I leaned forward and pinched the soft part of my nose until the bleeding stopped about 20 minutes later, at which time my husband suggested that I check my blood pressure, having read that a nosebleed + high BP could be a warning sign of artery blockage. My reading was 175/93. Retook in other arm and it was 182/95. Sat quietly for 15 minutes and tried to relax, then retook. Third reading was 181/98. I didn't like the trend, esp. in the diastolic which was higher than I'd ever seen it, and it was 6 PM on Sunday evening so my PCP was not available, so we decided to go to the ED. In the couple of hours I was there for observation, my BP started to come down. The nurse told us they see this all the time when people become resistant to the dosage of meds they are on and need an adjustment. Granted, also, I was very scared, and I know that was affecting my BP readings. They released me with instructions to follow up with my PCP, which I did yesterday. (By yesterday morning my BP had returned to normal. I've since had a couple more nosebleeds, not accompanied by very high BP like the first time, but still higher than I'm used to.) What this post is about is what my PCP has told me to change: to continue taking one dose of Losartan / day, \*except\* on days when I know I'm going to be stressed or I see high BP readings. On those days I should take two doses of Losartan. Has anyone heard of managing BP this way? I thought the goal was to have a consistent amount of medication in your bloodstream at all times, and wonder if "some days taking two" could cause my BP to be more erratic overall and lead to unwanted side effects. I would love to hear from you if your doctor is managing your BP the way my doctor wants to, or if you know the answer to my question. I've spent the past day trying to find anything to read that supports this idea and have come up empty. At this point I'm just not convinced it is safe to do what my doctor is advising, but I am open to changing my mind. Thanks for reading and for sharing any experience you have in this area.

Just increasing the dose whenever blood pressure rises isn’t something I’ve ever seen recommended in any guideline, and it overlooks a few important things: 1. Is there a recurring factor that’s preventing proper control, even with the usual medication? 2. When the patient is making healthy lifestyle changes, is it really necessary to increase the dosage? 3. Or even… is the patient showing the same blood pressure values when daily habits improve? Or slightly lower readings, even with the regular prescribed dose (just one tablet)? Blood pressure control involves many details. Simply increasing the number of pills might “work,” but it treats the **numbers**, not the **person**. We have to go beyond that. There are a few people here and on Discord using my blood pressure monitoring platform — it actually includes these kinds of details and really helps to understand where adjustments can be made. There’s an English version too, so feel free to use it if you’d like. The link is in my profile. But yeah, increasing the dose just because the pressure goes up doesn’t make much sense to me. Take care!
