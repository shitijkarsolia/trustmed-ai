Hi all. I’ve been having a awful day with readings between 201/98 and 166/94. I had a latte this morning and forgot to mention I needed it decaf. Has anybody ever had an hypertensive crisis due to caffeine sensitivity/intollerance? If so, how long did it last and how did you deal with it? I’ve been having headache for over 9 hours now and drank 1.5lt water. Thanks in advance for any reply.

I am 95% certain that coffee as such isn't so harmful against blood pressure + if it was coffee related you'd have symptoms like tremors? HOWEVER, I had similar experience with salt (prosciutto) and I had 220/134 blood pressure. With a pill for widening vessels and getting water out of my body it dropped to 150/90 in 15 minutes. And also, as stated in may journals, headaches can 'cause high blood pressure as you're in pain.

I was awake for about 24 hours and definitely had the shakes and elevated heart rate. I didn't check my BP because I knew it would have just freaked me out. You may just need the ride it out. I could imagine your BP could remain elevated for a few days even but the main impact should wear off within a day. Try to relax and just keep yourself distracted.
