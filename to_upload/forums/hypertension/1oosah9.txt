===============================================================================

I've had a problem with high blood pressure now for a couple of years and I've been handling it pretty well with medication. Within the past 3 weeks I started to get headaches and decided to take a BP reading with my portable monitor (one that my doctor checked out a few years ago). The reading was high, as in 175 over 111 high. I have clonidine to take for when it gets 160 over 100 and I began taking that every 6 hours. My BP would only go down to the 150 over 90 range but would constantly average 160 over 100. I made the earliest appointment for a doctor's visit a week after that. In between I checked out 3 other blood pressure monitors and they all read pretty much the same thing. Averaging around 160 over 100 after taking all of my medicine. It would go as high as 170 over 110 if I went too long in between doses and it was also that high in the morning before I took any medicine. Today was my doctor's visit. During the visit we took readings on my portable monitor and on his portable monitor. Both were 160 over 100. However, the doctor and the NP both took manual readings and were VERY sure that my BP was actually 130 over 80. What is going on here? Why is every portable monitor I'm using showing one thing while manual is showing another?
