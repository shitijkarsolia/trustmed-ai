I'm a M 33 and I have been diagnosed with High BP since 25 Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit please be gentle. I came here to look for outer opinions on something I have been suffering for a few weeks. About a month ago I had to go to the ER because my BP was at 195/138 P at 150 and being honest this scared me shitless. I don't know what exactly triggered this but my theory is bad eating habits + sedentary life + very bad sleep hygiene .Since then I have been taking Amlodipine 5, HZ 12.5 and Irbersartan 300 and my BP has been consistently low except for my pulse that sometimes is on the low 100s and have been eating better and walking. Now the thing is, since the episode I get anxiety for EVERYTHING related to doing exercise or getting intimate with my partner, thinking of the worst. I dont know what to do about this especially since I get fatigue sometimes while walking or doing some lifting doing chores at home. Have someone been through this? Anyone has tips? I really appreciate the comments.

That was nearly 4 years ago. I *now* average 120/85 thanks to meds, my heart is normal size and function, I was discharged from the retinal clinic after 2 years with almost all my eyesight back, and my kidney function has remained pretty stable. I hike, climb small mountain peaks, am happily married let's say ;) and live a normal life. Weekend just gone i was at a Halloween party in a black lace ball gown and 6" platform boots, the next day up in London watching a band at the Forum I've been waiting 20 years to see and getting home at 1am. I'm 50 in 2 years lol. Anyyyyway - a couple of minor blips that didnt cause any harm and had obvious causes aren't anything to be anxious about. Concentrate your energy on those lifestyle changes, lower any risks you might have had, so you know you’re doing all you can for your health, and your heart and mind will both thank you for it.

3. u/ImaginationLost8831 [score=7, created=2025-11-05T04:29:34]: It’s always best to refer to a doctor. I had a similar issue so bad to the point I couldn’t be intimate with my wife. Doctor prescribed me anxiety meds and I haven’t needed them because I guess knowing I had them has helped keep my anxiety low. I took very poor care of myself prior to my Hypertension diagnosis and since have been putting in about 40 minutes of walking a day, making sure I’m constantly getting up and moving every hour, and changed my eating to a DASH Diet approach. My numbers are typically about 100/25 mmHg lower now then it was when my issue started. I’m also on 4 meds now for BP until I get it more controlled and luckily I have a doctor who wants me off meds.
4. u/Hairy-Hat-5344 [score=4, created=2025-11-05T02:22:57]: Been through almost the same thing, and I figured out it was the amlodipine that was causing the anxiety/panic attacks. It might be the same for you since u just started taking amlodipine, and when I first started it took a month for the side effects to kick in.
5. u/OverwhelminglyAlive [score=5, created=2025-11-05T05:36:54]: Ramipril, lostartan and amlodipine made me have anxiety bad. Drs didn’t believe me but I don’t get along with them. Can’t take propranolol for my heart as it’s low resting 50 s so I have been doing some box breathing and drinking Hawthorne berry juice/beetroot and ginger. It’s slow but working. Also grapefruit is great but not with medication as it can make things worse. Talk to your dr about your side effects and see if they can help whilst your getting healthier.
6. u/WishingYouCardioWell [score=4, created=2025-11-05T09:28:42]: Glad to hear you got your BP under control. Now how do you go about leading a normal life. Exercise is key. Start slow as you get more endurance your blood pressure will naturally drop. Can you climb two flights of stairs without being windeded? Start walking just 5-10 min. a day. This is a journey. Focus on getting plenty of sleep. It will take a year or more. Be patient. You can, over time, at least reduce your dependence on medications.
7. u/Maleficent_Match5510 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T02:46:22]: All ‘sartans’ I’ve tried- 4 i think including tel, can, lo and val - have all given me insomnia and brutal anxiety and restlessness. Also tingling skin. GP would never believe me but its beyond doubt - been on enough of them. None of these issues within days of stopping them. Symptoms start within days of resuming them. May be relevant. May not.
8. u/KaleidoscopeDue5908 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T11:59:22]: Anxiety and high heart rate is likely from the Amlodipine. That drug does work quickly to bring down BP but has horrible side effects. Many people cannot take it long term.
9. u/witchkingkei [score=2, created=2025-11-05T12:09:11]: Ty everyone for you responses, I'll take this to my Dr and see what can I do. I appreciate y'all.
10. u/MariaBelk [score=1, created=2025-11-05T03:21:33]: When I took amlodopine, I had shortness of breath while going up stairs or walking up hills, so the fatigue you are feeling might be a side effect of the medication.
11. u/amosthagreat [score=1, created=2025-11-05T10:40:45]: I have cardiac anxiety too. The best thing to do is keep pushing through it you don’t want to build the anxiety up towards it. Keep working out if you have to stop and rest and go back to it do it. I felt that every time I went upstairs like paranoid my heart was beating fast but it’s supposed to! Therapy for this can help too.
12. u/Lady_Sasasala007 [score=1, created=2025-11-05T11:29:13]: When anxious, breath in deep thru your nose and exhale slowly thru your mouth for 10 minutes. Take a 5 minute break and start again as necessary, your pulse will go down and BP too. And, this will relax you. I think we all go through anxiety with BP issues.
