===============================================================================

I am 39 male from India. Yesterday my BP was 168/115. Today at office it spiked to 187/121. For 2 days I have had pain on the right side of my face, right arm, and behind my right eye. Office medical gave me Amlodipine 5 mg. After resting BP came down to 137/93. I am seeing my family doctor today. I have cholesterol history and stress,.I have a long history with excessive drinking and smoking on a daily basis. I had high BP but kept ignoring it till it came back to bite me. I am scared of getting stuck on daily meds forever. I want to reverse this with lifestyle. I am ready to follow a structured plan. Questions to the community: 1. For people who reversed hypertension or reduced dosage: what actually worked over months (not just theory)? 2. What changes gave the biggest impact (food, salt, sleep, alcohol, fat loss, steps per day)? 3. Does anyone here successfully taper off meds after lifestyle improvement? 4. What daily BP tracking routine do you follow? 5. Any specific blood tests or scans I should insist on? I realized today this can actually damage the brain or eyes if ignored. I want to take this seriously and make this a turning point. Please share your experiences (not medical advice) so I can have better discussions with my doctor and plan my next few months realistically.

2. u/Kiernla [score=3, created=2025-11-05T04:01:01]: I was able to wean off BP meds. I think for me the biggest impacts were making sure I get more sleep, completely stopping alcohol consumption (I've never been a smoker), and walking regularly.
3. u/Forward_Limit_838 [score=3, created=2025-11-05T08:20:36]: Quit smoking, cut daily alcohol (spikes BP), wear a smartwatch that tracks steps, reduce red meat consumption, lose weight. Stuff you already know. Do alcohol first if you can. It raises BP
4. u/ImaginationLost8831 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T04:33:40]: Quit smoking I huge, Exercise, DASH Diet using fresh ingredients, stay hydrated and get good sleep. All helped me lower my BP to a range that is acceptable. I’m still on meds but have dropped my BP 100/25 mmHg since I started all that.
5. u/Joanrtr [score=2, created=2025-11-05T06:06:56]: I like amlodipine, but for me, I needed a combination of 3 drugs to keep my bp normal. I take amlodipine 5, lisinopril 10, and HCTZ 6.25.

I do 2 days running and 2 days weights most weeks. Monitor salt intake and diet. Quit all nicotine and drinking. I usually only drink once a week, and only maybe 3 drinks that one day. I am newer to the blood pressure monitoring and have only been on this train for a month or so, but these steps have helped me.
7. u/Ok_Molasses2868 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T08:55:59]: No gluten, no caffeine, no smoking, no drinking. In the meantime drink a lot of coconut water.
8. u/Ill_Friendship3057 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T09:14:45]: If you have pain on one side of your body and your BP is spiking up towards 190 then you are in dangerous territory. You need to take the medicine. ALSO you should change lifestyle to get it down. For me, my BP has gone up and down over the years and now I am on meds again, but in the past the only thing that really helps to control it was exercise. Going to gym, taking group fitness or yoga classes, running outside.

10. u/Chi3f_Leo [score=2, created=2025-11-05T13:20:38]: If you're already taking a multivitamin every day (which everyone should, really), adding a second pill really isn't much of a hassle. That's how I look at it anyway. It's the other lifestyle changes that were more difficult at first.
11. u/No_Choice8923 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T20:59:23]: If your BP is above 160/100 thats on a little higher side but not too dangerous. I would suggest you take the meds so can come out of that zone so can save yourself. I am taking medication for past 1 year but now I have started to wean myself as this is journey and you have to spend time to reverse it. I use garlic chopped in morning with warm water swallow it. Hibiscus tea twice a day (i try but once for sure) Try to follow dash diet Cut down smoking 5 stick a week (should be 0) Started 5km walk doing since 2 months and saw huge difference And 1 week ago I joined gym to just do cardio but slowly pacing up These all helped me to reduce my meds
12. u/Revolutionary_Fan_60 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T23:27:12]: I was also in a similar situation with smoking and daily binge drinking. I was also heavily vaping pure THC. Quitting drinking is what really worked for me and also running helps. I am from India too and relate to lot of your points. Give your body atleast 60 days after quitting drinking for it to come to baseline BP
13. u/Clairefun [score=2, created=2025-11-07T05:30:21]: My high blood pressure gave me an eye stroke, heart damage, and kidney disease. I had no lifestyle changes to make- no smoking, no alcohol, no junk food, I had good sleep, good exercise, good weight, good diet- daily salads from my organic allotment, even. I will be on meds for life, but because of those meds, I *have* a life. Meds aren't scary, millions take them daily to save their lives - but uncontrolled blood pressure *is* scary. You know the lifestyle changes you need to make, and it seems likely that you'll be able to wean off meds later when your lifestyle changes have kicked in - but be aware that even if you can't, those meds are saving your life and protecting your heart and kidneys and brain from all the damage that high blood pressure can cause. If you do what you can to live healthily, you *and the meds* will be working together to keep you healthy and give you a long, healthy life.
