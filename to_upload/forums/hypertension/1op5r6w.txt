===============================================================================

Hi all, So I’ve had hypertension since my early 20s. Strong family history of hypertension and premature cardiac deaths. I’ve done a LP(a) lab and that came back totally fine, which is great. Did a heart CT, stress test, Holter monitor, checked for renal stenosis, and an echo. All came back great. I work out 5-6 times per week doing both strength and cardio (biking well over 30 miles per week at the gym at a resistance of 7.) I eat well and watch my sodium. Caffeine stays well below 200mg/ day and is fine with my cardiologist. We did a medication adjustment back in March or so after some weird top number readings for a while and since then my readings had been great. The last 3ish weeks I’ve gotten weird bottom number readings and now into top and bottom being weird (mostly mid to high 80s into 90s.) My cardiologist has been out sick as I’ve been keeping in check with them and we even double checked that my monitor is accurate as I take my pressure every day. I’ve managed my medical anxiety and take all my meds as I’m suppose to, take my readings according to AHA standards, and I’ve lost about 18lbs so far. VERY mild sleep apnea to the point I hardly qualify as having it (and they did the test when I was sick so they’re not even sure if I do have it as results may have been skewed.) Im on 50mg metoprolol er and 60mg nifedipine er/ day (taken in the morning with 24 oz water) and take my reading 2 hours after meds as I’m told to by my doctor yet my readings the last 3 weeks are still abnormally high. Any ideas on why this might be happening or things I could ask my doctor about to figure this out? TYA!
