My hypertension started in pregnancy. Pregnancy has special rules about BP because of preeclampsia. I’m kind of confused what I should be worried about now outside of pregnancy. I take a lot of meds for BP. I notice some people don’t like having to be on meds. Can you explain your thoughts as to why? Also, my BP is 120/80s but if I’ve been running around stressed with my kids or especially after I’ve been driving, it’ll go to 150/100, but always comes down if I sit down and chill. I’ve always thought that’s okay, as long as it comes down while I’m resting. Am I wrong? Also, I’ve never been worried about numbers like 130-120 on top and like 90-80 on bottom. Are there new boundaries for BP? Should I be aiming for lower than 120/80?

I developed white coat syndrome after have a preeclampsia emergency after the birth of my son years ago. I was able to overcome that for a while and was monitoring at home so the doctor could see it was fine when I was at home. They were satisfied with that. Then I moved on and stopped worrying about it. I fell into a little bit of a relapse here recently when I went to the doctor for a shoulder injury that was causing me a lot of pain and they took my blood pressure and it was 130/90 which honestly for me was not bad considering how stressed out I was but they made a comment about it which intern freaked me out and then made it go up even more the second time they took it. So now I’m back in the headspace of getting anxious to take it but am going to work on desensitizing myself to it again so I can get back out of it. Hope that makes sense.

If you spike at the doctors due to anxiety, doesn’t matter - just do it at home and record it. The BP that matters is RESTING BP. Having high BP when moving around is totally normal. 2) people don’t like meds because: - maybe side effects - may prevent you eating/drinking some stuff (grapefruit, alcohol) - you’ll have to remember to take them and it’s a bother - you have to pay attention not to run out of the meds, plus cost for meds - if you want more babies then you probably have to switch to less effective meds for pregnancy - it means you have a chronic health condition that is controlled with meds. I think many people want to be “cured”, and not take meds. If you are ok with meds for the rest of your life, then I guess you’re fine. NB: the 120/80 guidelines were for men. So some research suggests it should be even lower for women. But this is still new because duh, most research is done about men. Suggested preliminary guidelines for women (under 40 years) I think is something like 110/70. So I just take this as “don’t worry if meds are working too well” (unless it’s even lower than 100/60 and you get dizzy, which might be too low BP).

I get normal readings when I’m not stressed and elevated during acute stress and don’t know at this point if that is manageable or should looked into. Doctors never seem too worried when it’s high at the doctor’s office because I’m nervous.
4. u/Logical_consequences [score=1, created=2025-11-05T14:27:20]: I think you’re supposed to look at your resting BP? So it’s okay for it to be higher when active?

6. u/SANDY614 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T13:22:30]: I know mine is jacked up when I have an excess of adrenaline released. ARBS or Beta blockers are all the works for me due to different hormones all over the place and they block them. It's all hormones.
7. u/SnooBeans6368 [score=1, created=2025-11-09T18:41:30]: I hate bp meds because they have loads of side effects that often dont start for a year or two. Then you have to go through another experimental phase to find another, then another, or they pile 3 or 4 on top of you. I finally went keto after 21 years of bp med hassle and lost 50lbs. Got off all my meds and manage my bp by taking potassium supplements. Have to keep that weight off, though.
