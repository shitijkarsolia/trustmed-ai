===============================================================================

Been someone struggling since I started nifedipine months ago, after a spike of 191/90,however, no longer on it or taking anything. I've been doing a lot of lifestyle changes. Just checked my bo and it's 117/77 but is my heart rate always so high, like I'm the 90s and even sometimes 105. I have done echo and ekg, and holster monitored for two weeks and nothing unusual came back. Any thoughts??

I had a holter monitor and pushed the button anytime I felt different. My cardiologist said my readings were normal. Anytime I had a spike he could tell I was moving my body or just having anxiety.
