===============================================================================

I've been dealing with high blood pressure for 6-7 years now, back in 2020 it was as high as 160/110, and no meds helped me until I finally went on 40 mg of Lisinopril and 12.5 mg of HCTZ. Last year I got into a minor car accident and they incidentally found a small tumor on my left adrenal gland. They didn't say much, but just told me to reimage in a year to make sure it hasn't grown. I got another CT scan this year, and the tumor has not grown, but my endocrinologist had me to do a bunch of blood and urine work, and my cortisol levels were off the charts. It also explains why I get horrible, random anxiety. I'm getting the adrenal gland removed later this year and will have to supplement with steroids for awhile until my other adrenal gland "kicks in" and takes over for both. Reading other peoples success stories gives me hope, a lot of the time their BP goes back to normal levels. I know not everyone can just ask/request for a random CT scan, but if you have other symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and joint pain, then I would ask your doctor to check your cortisol levels.

2. u/Frisky_Fries_ [score=4, created=2025-11-05T21:20:02]: I wonder if this is what I’m going through? I have been having rapid heartbeat/ heart palpitations and random spikes of adrenaline and anxiety + high blood pressure. The adrenaline and anxiety is really odd to me because I’d be doing nothing nor be thinking of anything that would make me anxious..

Been dealing with high blood pressure for 20 years. Been on all the meds, all the fads and diets, excersie,nothing worked. Nepherologist , cardiologist x3 etc etc etc. Finally found a cardiologist that actually said" let's test your hormones ". Bam, that was the cause all these years. I never knew the 2 could be linked.

I’ve had high blood pressure almost my entire life and have been on hypertension medicine since I was 18, but recently it had become a much bigger issue. My readings were consistently in the 150–160/100–110 range. About three months ago, I had a colonoscopy. That evening, I developed severe stomach pain that sent me to the emergency room. I think something I ate may have triggered it, since they had removed some polyps, my stomach was probably irritated, which caused the extreme pain. During that ER visit, they did a CT scan and discovered a noncancerous tumor on my adrenal gland. After that, I followed up with my internist, who referred me to both an endocrinologist and a nephrologist. They diagnosed me with primary aldosteronism and started me on spironolactone, and finally, my blood pressure came down to a normal range. For now, my doctors say I don’t need to have the tumor removed, but it’s something I might consider in the future. They also ruled out Cushing’s syndrome. It’s wild, if I hadn’t had that CT scan, I would’ve never known the tumor was even there.

6. u/Fit_Pilot2979 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T20:15:11]: Did it show up on any blood work?
7. u/TheLastNameAllowed [score=2, created=2025-11-05T22:03:48]: My best friend died of adrenal gland cancer. Her only symptom was insomnia that i knew of until the tumor was so large that it cut it cut off the blood supply to her leg. Shocked they had you wait a year.
8. u/Such_Promise4790 [score=2, created=2025-11-05T22:47:39]: Did you get the adrenal vein sample first? I think the doc said if you have more than one tumor or if it’s on the other kidney as well they can’t operate?
