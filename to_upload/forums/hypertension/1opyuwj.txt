===============================================================================

Hi all, We’re doing a medication adjustment and I’m being prescribed a “very low dose” of amlodipine (unclear on what a “very low dose” is at the moment,) and I was looking for your advice and experiences? Currently I do 50mg metoprolol ER and informally 60mg nifedipine ER (nifedipine was never prescribed for BP, it was for suspected reynauds which is actually Pots for me and we will be coming off of it in the coming months.)

2. u/KaleidoscopeDue5908 [score=4, created=2025-11-06T08:34:26]: Of all the BP meds I’ve taken, Amlodipine had the most severe side effects. High heart rate, extreme dizziness, anxiety. While it does work to bring down BP quickly, I could not take it more than a few weeks.
3. u/scavenger7 [score=4, created=2025-11-06T09:19:47]: Been on 10mg a day for years. Don’t even notice I am taking it. Started on 2.5 and gradually increased over the years to keep bp down to 130/80. If my bp is down to 120/70 I get postural hypotension and feel dizzy if I stand too quick. More of a risk of falling and breaking something than running a little higher on bp.

5. u/Starbreiz [score=3, created=2025-11-06T20:14:36]: Worst med I've ever been on. I had severe insomnia and terrible depression for weeks before I had to quit for my mental health. And it was also a very low dose, 5mg.
6. u/alysson22 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T06:55:37]: I was put on Amlodipine besylate 5 mg then Valsartan hydrochlorothiazide 80/12.5 mg was added about 3 months later. I have responded well to both. I sometimes woke up about 4AM the 1st couple of months with the valsartin but that has subsided. I feel much better, less anxious, since taking them (+HRT). I can tell when they are working hard to keep my BP down, I will get “flushed” in my face &amp; sometimes chest (considered a side-effect). That usually only happens during extra stress &amp; I almost expect it.
7. u/RED-coat23 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T11:02:15]: I am wavering between 2.5 and 5 amlodipine. 3.75 works, but 2.5 doesn’t, so I am cutting pills, which I don’t enjoy. I may go back to 5 for convenience. No bad side effects, but mild lightheadedness and mild swelling at 5, so I may stay at 3.75. I also take lisinopril 10 and HCTZ 6.25.
8. u/phild1979 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T15:39:26]: I was formerly on 10mg it was OK, better than ramipril for me side effects wise. I did get oedema in btoh feet and ankles, burst capillaries on both feet and legs up to my calves, some drowsyness. At 5mg I felt nothing it was only at 10mg stuff started to happen. If you get the fluid retention with the oedema ask for a diuretic.
9. u/dugemkakek1 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T03:46:29]: I take 5mg averaging on 110/70 to 140/100 and still can get to 210/110 when panicking. Fun times isn't it
10. u/Letthesparksfly69 [score=2, created=2025-11-06T11:58:29]: I use to take it and had terrible side effects. I was on 25mg. I also took it w 3 other meds. Then got it as a combo of amlodipine, losartan, and the water pill. At 25mg if I recall. It worked well but I felt like crap and I stayed on it for 3mo and couldn’t hang anymore. I’m not on anything and just focus on my mental health, try to eat right and consume liquids. I have good and bad days but my quality of life is 10x better being off the drugs.
