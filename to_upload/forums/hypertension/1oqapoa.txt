I love eating chips! They are my go to snack. Can easily consume a bag or two but have since nearly eliminated them from my DASH diet I started a month ago. I’m desperately craving the salt and crunch now and need a replacement with a similar texture. What do y’all replace chips or recommend?

Once you start looking at packaging labels and cut your salt way back, you get used to a low salt diet and it becomes an okay thing. If you do have something salty, make sure you drink plenty of water. The water flushes the salt away quicker.

Alot of the microwave bags are still absolutely awful (in terms of lots of sodium and other bad stuff). With time, your tastes will change. Could perhaps make your own from fresh potatoes so you can control the salt amount on them. It sounds completely silly, but just a plain steamed potato is oddly satisfying at times (as I nibble one now).
