I’m 38 years old, 5’11”, and weigh 305 lbs. I work two jobs and tend to eat out often. I’m currently taking 80 mg of Telmisartan. I’m planning to start eating healthier and begin Wegovy soon. Does anyone else have a similar experience?

The only thing that helped me was going to a nephrologist and endocrinologist and getting a proper work up. Honestly, barring any other conditions you may have, the biggest thing that’s gonna help your blood pressure is losing weight.

4. u/johnny87auxs [score=6, created=2025-11-07T00:49:51]: That isn't high mine is 138/73 and it's normal. You do realize 50 years ago 140/90 was considered normal.. pharma trying to sell you meds !!!!
5. u/Babylon4All [score=2, created=2025-11-06T22:12:50]: What has your doctor said about it? How long have you been on it? Are you also exercising? What’s your fiber intake? Do you drink or smoke, if so stop those. That’s pretty low for your BMI… especially if only now you’re starting to consider eating healthier. Wegoovy will help, I would see if you qualify for Mounjaro, it’s definitely being shown to be better than Ozempic and Wegoovy for weight loss given it’s also GIP and not just GLP-1.

9. u/littlejohnnyrobert [score=1, created=2025-11-09T08:03:11]: 6'1 190lbs. I had a similar issue. Initially, the meds didn't do much, and my resting heart rate remained very high. After further tests and wearing a heart monitor my doctor could still not pinpoint why my HBP was resistant to medication. This is after being prescribed 3 different types BP medication. Eventually, a sleep test was ordered and I was diagnosed with borderline severe sleep apnea. After 6 months of sleeping with a CPAP my blood pressure is back to normal. Of course, I'm not implying that this is your issue but at least something to consider if you can't pinpoint the reason behind what's going on.
