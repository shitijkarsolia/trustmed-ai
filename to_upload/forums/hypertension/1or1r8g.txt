Hello I'm wondering if anyone has their left arm blood pressure higher than their right arm and what issues could that possibly indicate? Today my left arm reading was 124/86 and my right arm was 110/76. I have measured it as big a difference as left 141/91 and right 121/85. I was taking telmisartan 20mg and in the past week I've gone up to 40mg. I have been in poor health recently and I believe this is key to figuring out my problems. Shortlist of symptoms include chest pain that doctors have ruled out common heart issues, left shoulder area pain, discomfort when lying on back, high resting heart rate. I'm at 38M.

You should bring it up to your doctor who is qualified to diagnose. They’ll probably request ultrasound to check you out. The good thing is that neither of the blood pressures are alarming.
