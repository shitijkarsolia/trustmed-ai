My father’s (60), dr just replaced his lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide 25mg. The lisinopril was causing severe coughing and choking episodes. The dr doesn’t like the ARB class much so he said this is his next choice How have experiences been with it? I was looking through the subreddit using the search feature but a lot of it is negative so I was maybe hoping to hear some positives Thank you

If not why not try something like amlodapine as it usually doesn't have many side effects. You wouldn't need to be going to the toilet every 5 mins
3. u/Melodic_Function_107 [score=3, created=2025-11-07T12:47:46]: Mine was terrible. I had severe dehydration and was taking in so much water my NA was dangerously low. I also felt like like I "woke up" after stopping. On the other hand lisinopril has had zero side effects for 20+ years. These meds are very individual and finding what works is a journey. All the best of luck
4. u/exscapegoat [score=2, created=2025-11-07T13:07:52]: I take it for my high blood pressure. It's the peeing that's the main side effect. I got my doctor's ok to skip it if I'm going to be traveling or in other situations where there's not ready bathroom access. Also, check to see whether or not it's safe to take in a heat wave. I found I get too dehydrated when it's over 90. Even with drinking a lot of water.
5. u/Joanrtr [score=2, created=2025-11-07T18:42:50]: I am on HCTZ 6.25, lisinopril 10, and amlodipine 5. You did not say the dosage. Side effects are worse with a larger dose. A low dose might be tolerable. For me, a combination of 3 drugs, all pretty low dose, works better than a higher dose of one or two drugs. I didn’t like HCTZ 12.5, but 6.25 is ok. You have to eat some salt with HCTZ, as it reduces sodium. Check other electrolytes as well. Stay hydrated.
6. u/ProppaT [score=3, created=2025-11-07T12:15:36]: Very different medicines. That’s an ace inhibitor vs a water pill. It will all depend on the cause of his hbp. It’s pretty common to start people on Lisinopril and then add hctz if it’s not doing it. As far as Lisinopril goes, the coughing/throat itchiness usually only lasts a week or two if they recommend he try it again. It’s usually the first line med because it’s cheap and has the least side effects for most people.
7. u/Letthesparksfly69 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T16:28:17]: I use to take Lisinopril and it worked and had minimal if any side effects. I just got an itchy head and a chronic cough but we ruled that out because I have a cough in general due to my BP without meds. BUT it does NOT (for me) give me all day coverage so by mid day my coverage dropped and my BP spiked. Which I feel contributed to my cough. Eventually my dr took me off because it stopped working for me.
8. u/Ajay_Hellohealth [score=1, created=2025-11-08T00:16:44]: mostly pretty normal man, a lot of people say hctz is okay as long as you stay hydrated because it makes you pee more, some feel a bit lightheaded first few days while body adjusts, some notice leg cramps if potassium drops so sometimes docs add a potassium tablet or swap to a different bp med, for many it works fine and keeps bp steady with no drama, just drink enough water and check electrolytes once in a while, everyone’s body reacts a bit different but overall it’s like a chill starter bp medicine for most people.
