Does anyone else take labetalol? I was put on it because it’s one of the meds that’s safe during pregnancy. I’m no longer pregnant but still have to take it. If you do take it, I’m curious about how it works for you and dosage? I have to take a crazy high dose for it to work for me. Or at least I think it’s a super high dose. I take 200mg 3x daily. This morning I accidentally took 400mg and I was scared my BP was going to drop like crazy and it only was like 5 points lower than usual on the top and bottom, even after taking 200mg more than usual… I can’t take lisinopril because I’m allergic and Nifedipine works for me, but has a tendency to drop my BP way too low. So I’m stuck taking this super high dose of a med that doesn’t really work for me. Well, it works, but only if I take a super high dose.

I’m a bit nervous about the change since Labetalol has been working well for me and amlodipine seems to have a lot of side effects, but she wants to run some tests that Labetalol would interfere with.

4. u/antoniateresa [score=1, created=2025-11-09T06:00:07]: I take Labetalol (oral) only in an emergency (acute rise in BP) as it is a quick acting drug and brings down the BP within minutes. I get wild High pressure swings. The problem with taking it daily is that it also has a short duration of action (upto 4 hours effect). So unless you take additional HBP medications- the doctor will have to prescribe you Labetalol - at least 3 times a day
