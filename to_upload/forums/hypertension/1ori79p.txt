===============================================================================

I’m trying to figure out how much of this is normal. I was prescribed 2.5mg of amlodipine two years ago and had virtually no side effects other than occasional foot swelling. During those two years I lost 26lbs, reduced nicotine (from 120mg/day to 12mg/day) and caffeine (from 300mg/day to 40-60mg/day), and stuck to a low sodium diet. I was prescribed this because I went to the ER for a panic attack and they noticed my BP was 160/120 when I was there. Went to the doctor for my annual checkup a little over a week ago and they bumped me to 5mg after seeing that my numbers (also during a panic attack) were 150/92. Long story short I feel like the walking dead on the new dose. I’m sleeping at least 12 hours a day, and I have to drink crazy amounts of water to produce a normal amount of pee. I’m very rarely hungry and I often don’t notice that I’m hungry until I’m passing out from lack of food. I’ve also noticed that after orgasm my vision goes fucky and my chest feels sort of weird (not painful) for the rest of the day. My resting BP (semi-reclined, under weighted blanket) on the new dose is 116/64. I don’t know exactly how I’m supposed to take it but that’s how they take it when I’m at the ER. I do it this way because without the weighted blanket my adrenaline will skyrocket and that affects my readings. Before I started doing this, about 75% of my readings were taken during panic attacks. Other conditions I have: severe panic disorder (8-9 panic attacks per day on average), TRT induced polycythemia, Klinefelter syndrome.

The drug you are using is a calcium channel blocker .Calcium is the electrolyte that makes muscles and arteries(they are muscular tubes) contract.The natural way you get arteries to relax (god designed) is magnesium rich foods and nitric oxide creating foods. Magnesium is also a calcium channel blocker(surprise!)and nitrate rich foods make nitric oxide which also relaxes arteries and reduces overall tension. If you use mouth washes you destroy the mouth microbiome that makes nitric oxide(NO) if you have recently used an antibiotic, you destroy gut microbiome too, this will stop you making enough to keep your blood pressure low. Lastly sugar alcohol seed oils (omega6)and stress use up magnesium and up goes those numbers. Daily 30 minutes of gentle walking will produce NO … deep breathing exercises produce NO …any exercise too… try this little known trick to prove it ..put your back against a wall and try holding a sitting position for 30 secs to a minute… then sit down in a chair and compare your BP to one taken earlier… the NO will rise and the BP drops. Potassium is the next on the list eating leafy greens ,bananas (1 large equals 400 mg), apricots skins (4 equals 100 mg ), beetroot juice make nitric oxide too. This is a lifestyle choice you can make reduce the amilopidine to 2.5 and run it alongside these protocols you will see improvement.. I often wonder why doctors never give any advice but just a pill.. you alone are responsible for your own health so take control.. and get well.
