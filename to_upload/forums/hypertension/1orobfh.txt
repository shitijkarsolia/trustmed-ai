===============================================================================

Hey everyone Over the last few days, I've noticed that my blood pressure is constantly a little too high. For example, in the morning it is around 120/80, then throughout the day and in the early evening it is always around 140/80, and then in the evening, after I have relaxed for a while, it is back to around 120/80. I also notice that when I take several measurements in a row, my blood pressure drops by about 10-15. Should I have this checked by a doctor? Is it normal for blood pressure, especially systolic blood pressure, to be slightly higher during the day? I am 27 years old, do not smoke, and do not drink regularly. All in all, I would say that I have a relatively healthy lifestyle. Thank you in advance!
