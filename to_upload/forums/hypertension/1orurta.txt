===============================================================================

My doctor apparently set the Amlodipine im taking as no refills. Im taking it for my high blood pressure and the one time I missed it my blood pressure went up to 160/120 and was rapidly going higher. I dont know what to do. My doctors office isnt open on weekends. Has this happened to anyone else?? Or anything i could do?? Im so scared.

Called the practitioner and she said she would call in my refills that day. She didn’t. Called her the next day and everyday until Friday and the clinic phone went straight to voicemail with a full inbox. They are closed on weekends. So Saturday (my last dose day) I made a same day appointment with the telehealth service at Walgreens and all I had to do was show her my empty bottle with the label and she sent my refill to the pharmacy. Took an hour.

Beet juice can lower blood pressure, I drink it regularly and I have seen result when I test. I also workout regularly and sauna regularly, which helps too. Being scared or anxious will only raise your blood pressure , try some meditation and breathing techniques to relax. This probably doesn’t help you for this instance, but I have an acupuncture pad and always gets rid of my anxiety.
