Hi, My healthy yet elderly father (76) suddenly felt dizzy today after standing up from his PC and observed high blood pressure (155-160). I was not home but I was informed that aside from his usual 5mg daily dose, he panicked and ingested 3 more tablets totally 20 mg within a 24 hour period. His only reported effects were that he was dizzy so he was laying down and is now sleeping. I am not super informed so I am wondering on the effects of this and whether to be seriously concerned now or wait until the morning to check his blood pressure again and any side effects.

Only real thing to watch out for is if his BP gets to low he may well faint which would probably be a visit to the ER. Amlodapine is very commonly prescribed and im sure it happens regularly. There is a safety buffer built into the dosing so is very unlikely to cause serious harm and will wear off within 24hours.
