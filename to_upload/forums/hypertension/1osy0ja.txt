So, as we know, low BP is when you feel the most symptoms. Heart races, get dizzy, might pass out, short of breath, etc. I’ve noticed I feel AWFUL when my BP is “low.” I’m talking like 110/70, which the new guidelines say is ideal (I’m 27F), but that’s when I start to feel absolutely terrible. My heart pounds, I can’t catch my breath, I get dizzy, etc. I’ll take my BP and it’ll be “normal/low.” I’m much more comfortable at ~120/80. Does anyone else experience that/I’m good to be at 120/80 right? I’m confused about the new guidelines everyone talks about. My goal has always been 120/80, but now I’m unsure.

3. u/amosthagreat [score=1, created=2025-11-10T19:37:44]: Yes me too! I feel good at 125-130 over 75-80. I feel like under 110 over 60s is low for my body. I usually feel this most when I’m sitting down at night watching tv, feel like my heart flutters and a bit shaky? Then I get up, walk around and have some water and snack lol Are you on meds ? I bet most of us are on BP meds and we didn’t really need them we just had anxiety lol
