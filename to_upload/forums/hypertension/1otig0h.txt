===============================================================================

I had a period of about 2 weeks or so where I was hypertensive and had to go to the ER to get checked. Everything came back normal so it was probably due to high anxiety brought on by a panic attack at the dentist and then a traumatic event where my dog got attacked by another dog. I have been practising breathing, been taking cbd, and many homeopathic stuff (magnesium, hibiscus, bananas, beet juice) and it's working so well. I just wanted to share in case people needed new ideas on how to bring down blood pressure. At my highest I was hovering around 145-150/105. For the last 2 days I have been around 117/88. I got bought a new blood pressure monitor in case my was old and needed to be recalibrated. Also just wondering if it's normal to be lightheaded randomly due to the fluctuations ?
