===============================================================================

I (37F) started taking amlodipine 5mg in May 2025 due to a scary event that my PCP and myself thought were due to my high BP (160/98 during the event). I went to a cardiologist in June 2025 and got a clear echocardiogram and EKG and was told my heart was healthy and it was most likely a panic attack. I felt completely fine for months after that. Then at the end of October, I started feeling extremely dizzy, nauseous, had heaviness in my chest, palpitations, stabbing pains in chest, etc. The symptoms were different each day but the dizziness was consistent. I went to a different cardiologist today and he said my HR was pretty high at 90 BPM on my EKG and thinks all of my symptoms have to do with my medication. He believes I may not even have high BP and it can be controlled with diet and exercise. He told me to completely stop taking my amlodipine and to monitor my BP. If it gets too high, he’ll prescribe me a different med. Has anyone had an okay experience with stopping amlodipine suddenly like this? I’m really scared I’m going to end up in the ER if I do this. My BP these days has been in the 120-130/80-90 range, depending on what i ate during the day. If I eat extra clean, I’ve seen it go down to 115/75.

The medicine will automatically taper itself down over a couple of weeks. If you're worried about it you can cut down little by little. Got the pill and quarters and go with three quarters for a few days then half, etc. You can check your blood pressure during these times and see how you do. If you are in a good State without the amlodipine, things should be relatively stable. There will be a few ups and downs while you wean off.

My latest put me in ED. There it was 210/110. CT scan, and EKG all normal. Started Amlodipine and today 114/82 (more than awesome for me!)
3. u/amosthagreat [score=3, created=2025-11-10T19:31:35]: You could go back to your doctor and say cardiologist told me to stop cold turkey but I’m not comfortable with that and would like to try to reduce to 2.5 mg amlodipine and monitor my BP.

I’ve been diagnosed with vestibular migraine but I’m wondering if the amlodipine is make those symptoms worse and if i can get on a lower dose. Bp today is 121/78, i do some light cardio exercise on a hand cycle almost every day but the dizziness limits me alot. Been on 10 mg since may 2024 was on 5 mg before that.

6. u/MoreThereThanHere [score=2, created=2025-11-10T18:06:46]: Vey long half life. Self tapering. No real rebound of CCBs anyways. In total, very safe to stop abruptly
7. u/ProppaT [score=2, created=2025-11-10T16:05:34]: You should be fine. If your cardiologist has told you to do it, you should be fine. They’re seeing that your heart is healthy and you’d probably be better served with something like Lisinopril and not a calcium channel blockers. Amlodipine generally isn’t a front line med.
