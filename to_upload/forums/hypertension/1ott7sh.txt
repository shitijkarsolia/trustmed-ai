===============================================================================

I wasn't able to get a refill after I ran out of my Amlodipine 5mg prescription almost 3 days ago, finally got it now. I know its okay within 1-2 days to just take as normal, but does that apply to almost 3 days? Im just a bit paranoid I suppose.. my doctor hasn't been in contact with me through this all and ive never had to take a medication constantly like this, so its been a new experience to figure out.

I don't know if you're in the US but pharmacists can refill a few days worth of a med as long as it's not scheduled if you're waiting on a refill, list meds etc. In the long run consistency is key. Now that you have your meds back just start taking them as before.
