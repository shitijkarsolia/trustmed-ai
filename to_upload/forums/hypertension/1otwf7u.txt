===============================================================================

I live in Thailand. I made the mistake of buying an Omron BPM HEM-7600T. It is highly rated and I got what I think was a good price. Unfortunately, it does not work with the Omron Connect app that I downloaded from Apple's US iPhone App Store. It does work with the Omron Connect app that my wife downloaded from the Thai App Store. Unfortunately, my iPhone is set up to use the US App Store and it is no longer easy to switch app stores. So, I'm looking to buy an equivalent Omron BPM that will work with the Omron Connect app that I downloaded from the US App Store.

Besides the values and classification, it brings other fundamental data to observe blood pressure control and related factors. It has an English language option, feel free to join the team. I always used the Omron apps with my patients, but a lot is missing for us to manage blood pressure; the number alone is not enough. You can find the link on my profile.
