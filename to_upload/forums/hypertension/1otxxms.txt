===============================================================================

I’ve been taking 100mg Losartan for 3yrs and notice my BP never goes down to normal range. My doctor is saying to add more meds, but I want to try losing more weight , exercise etc to see if any has an impact. On top of this, I remember hearing taking meds at evening is more effective. Is this correct?
