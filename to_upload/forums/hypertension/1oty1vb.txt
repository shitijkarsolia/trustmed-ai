===============================================================================

I was on Telmisartan/Amlodipine combo for over 3 years. Recently I stopped taking them because I was troubleshooting some horrible bowl / digestion issues and Telmisartan was the suspect. It appears that it was indeed the culprit. I never realised how shit I felt on them until I came off them. My mood is better, my aerobic ability is better and I feel great! To add to that my BP is stabilised at 125/65 ish, so I'm staying off the meds until that position changes, which my Dr concurs with. Anyway, the key thing I'm taking away from this is that I'm going to switch to another ARB if I have to go back on the meds to see if that helps. But for now my body and mind is enjoying the break!

2. u/FollowTheMoney21 [score=3, created=2025-11-11T08:08:28]: I think the GI issues may be from Amlodipine. I switched from Losartan to Amlodipine and started having GI issues like bloating and acid reflux. Just my 2 cents.

4. u/mardrae [score=1, created=2025-11-11T00:46:01]: What side effects were you having from the Telmisatan besides stomach issues? I was thinking of trying it but have read bad stuff about it
5. u/ParticularWriting648 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T03:37:20]: Amlodipine caused horrible stomach pain for me and basically shut down my GI system. My doctor refused to acknowledge that this was a possible side effect. Took myself off the med and got a new doctor, am now on olmesartan and tolerate it very well. But agree with the OP that I feel much better when not on any kind of BP med.
