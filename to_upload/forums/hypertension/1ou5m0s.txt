===============================================================================

Last week, I made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/s/DuNqzNVixx First, thanks to everyone who contributed and reached out with advice. I wanted to follow up that post to get everyone's thoughts on what I've experienced the last couple days. In my original post I noted that the Endo told me I would see "near instant results" and she wasn't wrong. Less than a week into adding Eplerenone 25mg to the Labethol I had been taking - I started to see results. My typical BP is about 160/100. After a few days of taking the meds, I saw it start to drop to 125/95. Sounds good right? Well here is my concern - the last few days I've been experiencing light headedness and dizzy spells. I know this is a symptom of regulating BP. But I took my BP and was shocked to see the readings hovering around 105/75 throughout the day!! I've never had BP this low and frankly it seems like such a giant, potentially unhealthy drop?? I'm going to message the Endo but wanted to also post here to get folks thoughts.

1. u/Clairefun [score=1, created=2025-11-11T03:30:11]: Its a great reading - low bp isn't till 90/60 - but yes, its dropped quite quickly. Perhaps dosage could be adjusted. It could well be causing dizziness, but should pass as your body gets used to it. Glad its working, though, even if it needs a tweak!
