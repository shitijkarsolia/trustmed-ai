===============================================================================

I’m currently trying to lose weight to help reduce my blood pressure and for general health. I’ve seen that miso soup is great for weight loss and health/nutrition, but is obviously quite salty. I’ve also seen that, although salty, fermented foods (like miso and kimchi) are actually good for blood pressure. If so, I want to try to have it most days for lunch. So are foods like miso soup and kimchi safe to have regularly with HBP?
