===============================================================================

Not obese , quite muscle tbh I'm on TRt only about 180mg a week. My BP atm is 148/79 and I've had a dam headache for 2 days to the point I was almost crying.. well more like a migraine actually. I eat pretty good, do cardio HIIT 20 mins every morning .. I haven't been lifting weights or going gym much as I need surgery on my shoulder but that wouldn't be why my BP is high... I've tried candesartan, telmisartan and they all made me feel light headed and sick.. I'm now trying amolipine 5mg which hopefully works... Kind of running out of ideas tbh...

2. u/edumedibw [score=3, created=2025-11-12T00:12:56]: Plenty of other meds. Make sure you do a week of home bps as I’ve described before to assess baseline and response. What’s trt?
3. u/ProppaT [score=2, created=2025-11-12T16:14:40]: Stop taking trt. Your bp isn’t that high and won’t cause physical manifestations. It sounds like you know what your problem is and you’re in denial. I’m not your doctor.
4. u/edumedibw [score=1, created=2025-11-12T01:15:42]: Agreed but as I said get some average bps over a week to see what your dealing with
5. u/Clairefun [score=1, created=2025-11-12T07:21:52]: What's your weekly rested avergae when you don't have a headache? (pain raises bp). I'd imagine that could be your main issue - the headache raising your bp temporaily - but I've no idea if, fo example, TRT can cause headaches, or anything like that. (I'm perimenopausal so am VERY aware that hormonal fluctuations can cause headaches, but I don't take my bp when I'vve got one, as it's not an accurate indicator of my normal bp). If your bp still turns out to be high or elevated, a combination of meds is often effective, and 5mg amlodipine is a small dose so could be increased. Were you trying the two ARBs for long enough to get over any initial adjustment effects? ARBs are generally quite well tolerated, but all meds have a chance to make you feel off for the first week or two as your body adjusts to them. It usually passes, in most cases.

7. u/magiwulf [score=1, created=2025-11-12T20:57:20]: Whatever my general doctor was prescribing was not working for me either, I tried it for a month and months, and finally took the initiative to call cardiologist and they set me on the right track.
8. u/Guilty_Fold1590 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T13:45:55]: I'm a very similar situation, 43m, trt 120mg wk, labs perfect, test high range of natural, muscular, do regular cardio, 50-55 resting HR and similar BP #'s prior to meds. I started on telmisartan and tried to titrate up to fast, felt like fuck. Got off it started amlodipine 5m, then added 20mg telmisartan, and went up by 10mg each month. I'm now on twynsta which is a combo med of 10mg amlodipine and 80mg telmisartan with good BP control. You just gotta give it time to adjust and minimum 1 month before increasing the dose in small increments.
