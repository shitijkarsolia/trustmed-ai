===============================================================================

So i took my amlodipine 5mg at 6 pm yesterday, then fell asleep and woke up at 2 am thinking I hadnt took it, for some reason instead of checking my notes where I have it written down I immediately took one... I feel stupid. But I assume it will be okay? My doctor did want me to start upping my dose because for a bit it wasn't going as low as we hoped. But I did just start taking them again after not having any for 3 days so Idk if that'll mess with anything ? Also how should I take it next time after this?

2. u/Clairefun [score=1, created=2025-11-12T07:13:12]: I'm on 10mg a day, it's a normal dose, so you'll be fine, but you might feel a bit crappy having not had any for three days and jumping straight in to 10mg. It'll pass. If you're supposed to be taking 10mg anyway, then I'd suggest just continue - though perhaps not taking it at 2am. I recommend a reminder on yor phone to take it at the same time every day, that only goes away once you click it to say you've taken it. Or a day of the week pill box! (I use both, but I'm on 3 BP meds a day).
