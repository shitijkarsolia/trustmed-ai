I literally know everyone here is going to call me a WEAK MINDED individual for succumbing to PLACEBO so easily but I was recently prescribed 5mg olmesartan medoxomil and for some reason I genuinely feel like my anxiety is reduced. Again I know it means I'm weak minded and easily fall for placebo

It works by relaxing your blood vessels and allows your heart to beat more smoothly, so, you know, why wouldn't that relax you?
