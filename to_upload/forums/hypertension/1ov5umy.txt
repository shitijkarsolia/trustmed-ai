===============================================================================

I started on amlodipine one week ago and almost immediately my heart rate went crazy. I’m talking a resting heart rate of 87 up from 65 a week ago, and I can’t walk up a flight of stairs without hitting 150 I’ve stopped the med, but for those with this experience: how long until your heart rate returned to normal? Did it totally return to normal or are you still struggling to find a new normal with a higher, more variable heart rate? Amlodipine 2.5 for 6 days. D/c and started carvedilol 6.5mg 2x per day (11/11 pm)

2. u/Joanrtr [score=2, created=2025-11-13T08:27:03]: I reduced amlodipine from 5 to 3.75 by cutting the pill. It helped my blurry vision a lot, but BP went up. Frustrating. It doesn’t raise my heart rate, which is 40-55 bpm.
