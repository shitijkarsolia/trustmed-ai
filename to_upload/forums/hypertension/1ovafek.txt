Maybe I ask. What are your experiences to when is the best time you test your blood pressure? Right before your next dose or around the clock ?

2. u/quadruplebogey1 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T09:56:03]: I usually take mine around 7-8 AM as well as about 8 PM. My doctor likes a morning/evening reading. Mine’s been fairly stable for a good period so I only take it once a week now. But I’ve been at the point where I took it multiple times a day.

4. u/RED-coat23 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T14:58:11]: I test morning and evening with no regard to whether I have eaten or exercised or taken meds. I also measure during the night when and if I wake up during the night. This is because my BP is highest during the night. I don’t know why, but it happens to some people. Sometimes I even wear the cuff, so I just have to press the button. My Omron Platinum sends readings to my cellphone, so I don’t have to try to remember or write down the reading. It also has a lit display, so I can see it in the dark, so I can keep the room dark. I have measured more often, to learn my pattern, or when not on meds (I took frequent walks to keep BP down.).

6. u/Clairefun [score=1, created=2025-11-12T10:16:55]: I've heard mornings about 30 mins to an hour after waking, after using the 'facilities', but before food, drink (other than water) and before meds. You don't do it straight from waking as cortisol is often highest upon waking up - it's naturally released to wake you, but will skew bp a little higher - but before you're too active in your day. At night, the equivalent - I do it shortly before bed as I'm winding down for the day, but long enough after food and drink and evening meds if you take them to not be affected by any of those things.

8. u/edumedibw [score=1, created=2025-11-13T00:05:58]: Morning an evening for a week before doing is the advice.
9. u/lisaizme2 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T10:55:57]: Am &amp; pm. Amount of Medication based on the numbers
10. u/liyyah456 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T22:39:19]: Midday when I’m actually active I just take a 10 min break check it then go about my day
11. u/Ultragin [score=1, created=2025-11-14T07:45:37]: Basically first thing in the morning. I know that’s not quite ideal, but it’s the only way I’d be consistent with it. Since I measure and track every day. I’d rather minimize all other variables and get into a routine.
