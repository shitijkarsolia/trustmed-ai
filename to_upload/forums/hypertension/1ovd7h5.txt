2. u/Logical-Drive-641 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T11:50:36]: # Typical Physiological Effects (Short-Term) After use of a pouch (e.g., 6–8 mg of nicotine): * **Systolic BP increase:** \~5–15 mmHg * **Diastolic BP increase:** \~3–10 mmHg * **Heart rate increase:** \~8–12 bpm These spikes generally normalize within 30–60 minutes after use — but **chronic users** can experience a sustained elevation of baseline BP over time due to constant sympathetic activation and vascular stiffness. # Long-Term Considerations While nicotine pouches are *safer* than smoking in the context of combustion toxins or carbon monoxide exposure, nicotine itself still has vascular consequences: * Promotes **endothelial dysfunction** (reduces the ability of blood vessels to relax properly) * Increases **oxidative stress and arterial stiffness** * May upregulate **angiotensin II**, worsening chronic hypertension * Potentially aggravates **arrhythmias** and **platelet aggregation** Over months or years, this can translate into elevated cardiovascular risk — even if the person avoids the carcinogens of tobacco smoke. # Confounding and Institutional Blind Spots Mainstream regulators often focus narrowly on **smoking vs. non-smoking**, ignoring cumulative stimulant load and vascular strain from chronic nicotine intake across “alternative” forms — vape, pouches, gum, etc. The industry-funded research on nicotine pouches tends to underreport subtle BP increases by cherry-picking short-term, small-sample datasets. Independent cardiologists often highlight that the *repeated micro-stimulation of the sympathetic system* is what wears down the heart over time, even if “no formal hypertension” is observed in the early studies. # Plain Language Summary * Yes, nicotine pouches raise blood pressure transiently. * Chronic use likely increases long-term cardiovascular risk modestly. * If you already have hypertension or anxiety, it’s a poor choice. * If your blood pressure is healthy and you’re using them occasionally, the risk is relatively small — **but not zero**.

It's normal when I first wake up though. I have to slowly give up nicotine and caffeine and damn it's hard even with anxiety
4. u/Logical-Drive-641 [score=4, created=2025-11-12T11:52:08]: My niece just found out she was pregnant and she vaped nicotine. I was shocked when her OBGyn told her that the nicotine was fine to continue during pregnancy. She fired that Provider when I sent her the data.
5. u/CuriousCountry3768 [score=1, created=2025-11-13T02:04:55]: Yes, it does. I’ve noticed a difference of about 10 mmHg in my blood pressure after quitting snus. Although snus or pouches is generally considered less harmful than smoking, it still has a significant effect on blood pressure. Oral tobacco or snus keeps BP elevated for a longer duration while smoking may raise it for around 30 minutes, snus or oral tobacco can keep it elevated for an hour or more, depending on how long it’s kept in the mouth. If you are using then its advisable to take bp after an hour or two hours after last using oral tobacco..Its better to quit though.
