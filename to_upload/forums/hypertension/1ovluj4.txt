Hi everyone! Some background on me I’m 37 yo had two children first child was the first time I was diagnosed with hypertension in pregnancy (27 years old at the time) was on meds during pregnancy delivered and did well getting off. During this though began my dread of the blood pressure machine… my second child I took baby aspirin and did not develop high enough BP to be put on medication I was 34 then. Every time I go to the doctors though my BP is high I need to breathe relax it finally lowers even at home I have a machine my first reading will be high up to 140+/90+ but then I breathe relax and I get a good reading… now to yesterday I had an appt at a new OBGYN in the waiting room an older woman was screaming and it honestly brought me back to my childhood almost like a PTSD thing bc she reminded me of my grandmother. I texted my husband omg my anxiety is through the roof. I go in they take my BP it’s 170/110 (I’ve never in my life had a high reading like that) they tell me you need to go to ER at first then finally say go home you look ok but see you PCP. I go home thinking it’ll go down and take it myself and it’s high so I did end up going to the ER - they did EKG kidney function test chest xray and heart blood test everything was great! They said it seems it’s asymptomatic hypertension induced by anxiety… My question is this really if you made it this far if you were me on Tuesday at my PCP would you go in blood pressure medicine and if so what advice do you have? I’m so sick of this I honestly avoid doctors at this point… because of it I am going to attach a copy of the reading I generally get at home (More info if needed: I go to the gym 4-5 x a week for 1-1.5 hours, I eat mostly healthy but I am overweight even though I keep working out)

They’re near enough perfect across the board barring the odd one ridiculously close so I’d put it down to anxiety related as you’ve said. If they test you again it will no doubt be back through the roof as you’ll be worrying about it.
