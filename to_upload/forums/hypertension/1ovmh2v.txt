===============================================================================

So, recently while doing a blood pressure test, I saw my systolic was 140 and my dystolic was 80. Due to my job (I clean at a movie theater), time, and frankly laziness, I hadn't had the time to cook for myself, or exercise. I do go walks but I very regularly eat (or ate) at places kike McDonald's or a local fried chicken joint) Now this has been the case for a while, over a year, and only now I am dealing with issues, with chest pain and arm pains (although I have dealt with that prior as I have bad anxiety). Currently shopping for a meal that won't kill me, but since I have barely eaten anything in the past couple days, is it a bad idea to say fuck it and go get a burger?

Aka a normal day and for example being on vacation is about 20/30 points in my reading. When I dont care about salt intake Im 135/80 when I do Im 105/60 (on a lot of meds, cause I def have HPB) And fast food equals insane amounts of salt. Normal people should only have 6g of salt a day, people with HBP only 3g. The average person gets about 10-12g a day. Like one Big Mac is 42% of your daily salt. So thats without the fries and whatever else you order, plus all other food and surprisingly a fair few drinks a day. Most things baked are terrible as well salt. From 'healthy' bread to donuts. One donut, boom 1g of salt or more.

Fast food low sodium Panera 1/2 tuna sandwich 530 1/2 fuji apple chx salad 480 Chipotle Salad chx br rice bl beans faj sc 900 Subway 6" tuna no cheese + pickles 770

Feel tired, exhausted, can't be bothered cooking in that mindset, and then you have the symptoms of emotional eating that comes into play from time to time. You need to watch out for saturated and trans fats mainly and if you are going to eat outside regularly and concern about blood pressure then I suggest trying to find healthier options (as hard as that is).
5. u/DickStatkus [score=1, created=2025-11-13T07:31:02]: It’s the salt, one fast food burger is over half the daily amount of salt recommended for a normal person let alone one with high blood pressure.

7. u/johannisbeeren [score=1, created=2025-11-13T09:26:18]: Eating fast food as frequently as you say could very potentially be the reason for your HBP and issues. If you cut it out and replace with real food (not high processed foods like grocery store bought chicken nuggets or freezer meal type things) - very likely your BP will become normal and health issues cease. Being outside a normal BMI and eating a bad diet (typically high in sodium from processed foods that are unfortunately almost unavoidable in today's world) are the biggest reasons for hypertension. Exercise is also important, but you can't outrun a bad diet so the other 2 factors are more important.
