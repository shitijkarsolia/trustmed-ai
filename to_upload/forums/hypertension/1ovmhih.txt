===============================================================================

I was told by my GP that a high systolic (top number) with a normal or low diastolic, means that the cause of the HBP is usually due to stress. And if both high Systolic and Diastolic are high it's more likely to be other causes like vascular, kidney, thyroid, etc Not sure if this is true or not. Has anyone else come across this hypothesis?

1. u/Clairefun [score=5, created=2025-11-12T18:16:35]: Yes, pretty common. Stress and anxiety raises bp, but systolic is much more easily changeable and responds quickly to the physical symptoms of stress and anxiety - fast heart rate, quickened breathing, etc - so systolic shoots right up. Diastolic is slower to move, so it doesn't respond to anxiety, which is usually a short term episode. If its high all the time, it can be secondary cause, but can also be sedentary lifestyle, or being overweight. Either way, usually something more long term that your system is having to work harder to counter. 200/80 type of bp usually has a high heart rate and means they've taken it mid panic attack, 200/120 means you need a bunch of tests to find out what's out of whack. (For me, it was kidneys).

Pulse went from 54 to 89 in the process of checking. The cuff is a cause of major anxiety. Without definitive proof I’m chalking it up to the stress of checking and am going to do my best to not worry about my Bp all of the time. It is a terrible feedback loop.
