Hi all, kinda worried. 26f, and I vary between highly active (marathon training) and pretty sedentary, especially this last month as I’ve been navigating an ongoing migraine. For the last few years, every time I go to the doctor the nurses freak out about my blood pressure and ask me questions about how I’m feeling. Usually my diastolic actually is quite high, sometimes 100. Then, the PCP ignores or says don’t worry, just keep to a more regular exercise routine. Prior readings at appts: 130/82, 134/82, 141/101, 132/95, 129/90, and there was one other time diastolic was 100 and my pulse pressure was around 30-35. This summer I got scared and started keeping a log at home. In the morning, following all or most suggested relaxation protocols, my readings are usually around 110/70-125/85. In the afternoon, I’ll have spikes up to 140/100. When I’m anxious I’ll still have 135/85-95 in the evening even after sitting quietly, but the reading usually goes down. One time I got 151/100 but I immediately remeasured and it came back 135/80. I used to get angina (resting and with exercise) in college but was dismissed as anxiety when I tried bringing it up at the ER or with my PCP. They did an EKG and it came back normal. My bp at dr appts was in the 130/80s range but I was marathon training. I had my first heart palpitation two days ago; I wasn’t having an anxiety attack but I was generally quite worried all day and having a migraine while driving (furloughed fed with a monthlong migraine, hard not to be anxious lol). Q’s: Should I be freaking out like every nurse seems to? Be more insistent with my PCP that we explore medication or see a cardiologist? Am I just freaking myself out by taking it multiple times a day? Are spikes that high “normal”?

Start worrying when you get to like 180/130 or something. Why the heck are the nurses freaking out? Diastolic of 100 with a normal (and yes, that's pretty normal in an office) systolic doesn't mean much of anything, certainly it's not a crisis. So many medical people really don't understand blood pressure at all... You didn't state what "med might raise" I assume you are talking about triptans. Have you taken them before? Have they worked? Getting rid fo the headache might relieve both your anxiety and basely elevated blood pressure at the same time. What does your doctor say?

(I don't take it at the doctors any more!). Your calm readings are fine - there's no point taking it while anxious, it's going to be higher than normal. ALSO your auto generated reddit username is excellent, congrats on it! :D
