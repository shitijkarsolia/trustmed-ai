I've been taking prescribed Viagra (in addition to my daily meds) - whenever my BP goes very high - and it works well to reduce it. But the next day I get a dull headache and mild muscle pain - whenever I take it Would like to know the experience of others who take Viagra for HBP

1. u/Clairefun [score=2, created=2025-11-13T05:44:17]: is it pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure only in the vessels that supply the lungs? It can be used to relax blood vessels in the chest. Other than that, I've not heard of viagra being used to treat high blood pressure.
