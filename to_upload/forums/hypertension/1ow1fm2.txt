BP goes down a ,little but by 2 pm and even after meds goes up again 200/80 , 5 pm same .i feel its high overnight because i wake up to 200/79 in mornings . I’ve been out of the hospital 10 days but im not consistent , just high still , any words of encouragement how long will it take to get managed, i feel like a ticking time bomb with systolic this high . I’ve tried other meds Valsartan, metropol, coreg , they gave me a .5 Xanax to take before to see if it helps with my anxiety , doesn’t help . i am stuck in that cycle of anxiety to take it and when its high get more anxiety goes higher . how long has anyone taken to get it under control ? feel very defeated

Until they did the specific blood test to test for it, there was no “fixing” my out of control high blood pressure. Once diagnosed, I had surgery to remove the tumor/adrenal gland and now over 2 years later (although I’m on 3 meds) I enjoy relatively normal BP. Hang in there and keep making your doctors look for answers!

You can also practice deep breathing, humming during long slow exhale. Also, isometric exercise like wall sits or planks, with a total of 20 minutes not counting breaks. I’ve heard of singing, and cold showers, as other techniques to stimulate vagus nerve, but haven’t tried them. There are YouTube videos of supplements that lower BP. There are quite a few. I have taken them along with meds, with no problems. Hibiscus tea, made rather strong, they say twice a day. Another idea, have you taken anything for anxiety? I have no knowledge in that area. Try different drugs? HCTZ made a difference to me when that was added to my 2 drugs.
