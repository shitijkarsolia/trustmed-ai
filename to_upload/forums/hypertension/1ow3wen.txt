===============================================================================

I hate some of the side effects, like blurry vision. If I decrease the med by a little, it’s much less, but BP goes up, which I also don’t like. If I knew it would diminish, I’d be ok with temporary blurry vision. My doctor knows I am tweaking the meds. I’m on amlodipine 5, lisinopril 10, HCTZ 6.25.

4. u/Equivalent-Cap8606 [score=0, created=2025-11-13T11:17:18]: I didn't like the side effects of Amlodipine. Back pain, dizzy, feet hurting, and swollen ankles. . Didn't like Lisinopril because of hair loss and cough. HCTZ is just a water pill.
