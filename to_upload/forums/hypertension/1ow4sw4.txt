===============================================================================

I have been on Skyrizi since late February of this year, going from severe psoriasis and Psoriatic arthritis to nearly nothing. Well, until a week or so ago when I swapped BP meds to Nifedipine so I am not sure if this flare up could be caused by the med or not. I read it can cause ankle swelling online, which I have now. My legs are red like before, with minor flaking in some areas that I've been putting clobetasol on. My knees, ankles, and feet also hurt like they did pre Skyrizi. What do you guys think? Related, unrelated? Should I go to a different BP med? Does this swelling subside?
