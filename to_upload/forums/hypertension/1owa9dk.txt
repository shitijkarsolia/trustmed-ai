===============================================================================

I had a baby almost 12 weeks ago and had to be induced for gestational hypertension then a week post partum I was seeing stars and had some pretty high BP readings so they put me on medication for a bit but my blood pressure is still usually has at least one number over 120 or 80 there is family history of hypertension too so I want to take managing this seriously especially now that I have a baby! I met with my doctor today and she said the best thing I can do is watch my saturated fat and sodium intake Does anyone have recommendations for apps you use or other ways you make tracking easier I feel like tracking sodium will be the trickiest since it’s in literally everything

It has a very large library of foods and its quite easy to use. It tracks a variety of nutrients, including saturated fat and sodium (on top of calories).
