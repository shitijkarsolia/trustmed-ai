===============================================================================

I started Amlodipine in October, after trying lisinopril and getting an allergic reaction, but its come with a huge amount of side effects that make it hard to go about my day. Im already in a lot of pain from chronic issues but Amlodipine has caused me chest pain, acid reflux, foot and hand swelling that will not go down, and more. The chest pain freaks me out in all honesty and I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack when it started. My doctor wont let me try anything else because we've already tried two medications and she thinks I'll just have similar reactions on others. I honestly hate this, I feel like im at a loss for what to do and she never listens to me or validates my concerns. I cant see any other doctor because shes a free doctor im seeing through some program.. any advice would be appreciated, im just so tired of everything going on.

2. u/cinderful [score=2, created=2025-11-13T17:17:57]: Do some homework and come up with a suggest plan of care for yourself, which medications you might try in which sequence and how much time you will commit to trying them out. Obviously 2 weeks to a month is the better timescale. Write them down in sequence Also consider writing down a plan for yourself about lifestyle or diet changes (less salt, more potassium, hibiscus tea, stop smoking/drinking, exercise more, etc) and commit to those too. The reality is that you are in control of your own body, you are an adult and you can make choices, but your limits are the situations you are in. If you are having chronic issues that may also be related to trauma, absolutely work on those things too. Even though I can't point to a numeric improvement in by BP, it has dramatically changed my mental quality of life

I agree about Amlodipine. That one has been one of the worst. I just know that there has to be better meds. I wish you luck 🙏.
4. u/PoppysWorkshop [score=2, created=2025-11-14T02:16:55]: Fire your Doctor then! I had issues with 4 other meds including Amlodipine, (I remember the swelling) until I was put on Losartan HCTZ. Now my BP has been normal of 8 months. Granted I made dietary changes too. But you need to advocate for yourself and do so fiercely. Call this Dr out to her face. PS: i fired my PCP I had for a number of years, because he was phoning it in. He's the one that put me on the Amlo. Found a much better PCP and now My BP, diabetes, Cholesterol, liver and kidney functions are normal a year later. (Note, I am not cured, just under control)

6. u/CorvusGraves [score=1, created=2025-11-15T00:04:31]: I got started on Amlo, 5mg, quit that within 2 days. Side effects were unbearable. Now I'm on Losartan again at 25mg.
