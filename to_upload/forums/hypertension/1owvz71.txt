I’m a 30-year-old male who has been managing high blood pressure for about six months. I've been prescribed Concor 2.5 mg and Cortel 40 mg to help with the condition. However, I’ve started experiencing palpitations for the last four months, and they seem to be worsening over time. Along with these palpitations, I’ve noticed significant weight loss, which has left me feeling unable to engage in any physical activities. This situation has left me feeling scared and worried about my health and wellbeing

What was your baseline blood pressure before meds ? Did you suffer from tachycardia ie fast heart rate issues along with high BP ?
