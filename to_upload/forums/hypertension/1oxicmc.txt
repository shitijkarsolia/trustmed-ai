Hello! I am currently a student in my last year of college. As part of a senior nutrition course, we must interview someone with hypertension (blood pressure of 130/80 or above). If possible, please provide an email and I will reach out! While there are no incentives, I am passionate in the field of dietetics and this opportunity will be valuable in understanding patient experiences, background, medical history, effects of the healthcare system, and build on my knowledge of the medical field in general. Questions will ask for your: Lab values (blood pressure), experiences with HTN, current diet history (24 hour), medications/supplements, nutrition education history, other conditions, height, weight, allergies, and more. Thank you and I’m looking forward to contacting you soon!
