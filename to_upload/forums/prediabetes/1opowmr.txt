===============================================================================

So I had gestational diabetes and before that I had no idea I would ever come close to any of this anytime soon. My family has a history of diabetes but I thought I still had time considering I’m still in my mid 20s but I now understand this can happen to anyone especially to people who have a family history of this. After I gave birth I started to continue checking my blood sugar after 2 hours so far so good everytime it’s been below 140 even after eating fast food. Well today I ate cereal and for first time ever I was at 140 after the two hours. Anyways I’m now freaking out I have my postpartum glucose test next week and I’m just scared now. I know I’m all over the place but here goes my question is it normal to have it at 140 after 2 hours ? All I had was one bowl and it was corn flakes. I didn’t know it would be that bad. Can someone without prediabetes have a spike like that after eating one bowl of corn flakes I didn’t eat for hours prior to eating the cereal.
