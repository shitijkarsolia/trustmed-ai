===============================================================================

Has anyone else experienced weight loss with prediabetes? 5 years ago I was 170lbs, now I’m 154. I’ve cut out a lot of junk food in that time but I seem to have lost a lot of muscle and I hardly have much body fat anymore. Everytime I try and lift weight or get into an exercise routine my body just can’t handle it and I almost feel weaker/cold like symptoms in the days after. I’ve tried to eat more to put in weight but it’s just not working and people I know keep making comments about my weight loss although it’s not something I can help. I’m having some blood test done this week just to see where I’m at, I feel like the numbers have probably gone up since the last time. Anybody have experience with gaining weight in a similar situation?

Cutting out the junk food is great! If you haven’t already been doing any exercise, you’ll lose muscle mass. Also, if you’re wanting to lift weights, start slow, with very low weights. You’re going to be sore for a few days after (especially the 2nd day after). Still, I’d check in with my doctor if I were you.
