31F 261lb 5’6” southern US 5.8% very jarring. despite being overweight, I eat a fairly balanced diet. and I have taken up exercising again. so who knows what it may have been a few months ago. i’m committed to controlling it and not slipping into diabetes! my PCP told me today that his top 3 things to do when you get a PD diagnosis are: 1. get 8 hours of sleep 2. drink nothing but water 3. no eating after 7pm any unique advice would be super appreciated (:

1. u/rougeMBA [score=8, created=2025-11-06T20:37:00]: I found walking after meals to be very helpful in keeping my glucose spikes down. I also significantly reduced processed carbs (bread, cereal, pasta, rice...you know, all my favorite foods). I always thought diabetes was about sugar, but I think my daily Grape Nuts habit had more to do with it than anything else. Good luck!

3. u/Unlikely_List_6285 [score=3, created=2025-11-06T21:27:19]: You’re doing great already! I was in a similar spot a while ago, and small, steady habits really do pay off. Sleep, water, and early dinners help more than people think. I also found that tracking my meals for a week or two gave me a better sense of what foods caused spikes. You’ve got a great attitude that’s half the battle right there.
4. u/Veer_appan [score=3, created=2025-11-06T21:37:30]: Follow the common wisdom - eat in the right order, walk after meals, reduce stress, drink plenty of water, read the food labels carefully, do Keto if you fancy. Everyone on this subreddit has been on the same journey. I went from 6.3 to 5.9 to 6.1 :-(. Our bodies are different, and beer is Kryptonite for me. I have cut out beer, but I have been enjoying some red wine lately. I think I need to cut that out completely as well. Perhaps your PCP is right, drink only water. Good luck and report back with your progress.

6. u/Yay_Rabies [score=3, created=2025-11-07T06:20:51]: Many years before having an elevated A1C I made some major lifestyle changes. As your doctor said I cut down to only water. Seltzers are still water and I enjoy them. Mio sugar free flavors water so that I drink more. Coffee and tea with no additives are 0 calories. I use unsweetened almond milk to flavor both because it’s 15 calories but zero sugar. Torani makes amazing zero cal flavors so I tend to skip coffee shops unless I really want a treat. I only just started putting zero cal sodas back into my diet. Also our kids are around the same age but we’ve been doing “after dinner stroll” as a family for a long time now.
7. u/Jade_Star23 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T07:33:48]: Im at the start of my journey, so I dont know what my results will be, but I have made many changes since getting my bloodwork back. Im taking vitamin D and K2, Iron supplementation for my low ferritin, kril oil for my lower HDL. Im also in the beginning stages of perimenopause and started taking micronized progesterone which has helped me improve my sleep hygiene so Im sleeping 8 hours a night. The progesterone also slashed my stress levels so im sure my cortisol is down. My A1c was 5.7, insulin was 13 and glucose 96. I've just been eating healthy. The kind of eating I always knew was the best but just couldn't stick with. I prioritize fiber and protein at meals and am very strategic about carbs. I choose complex carbs and minimize simple refined starches. I took an active part time job where I can walk 2 hours a day and my family and I walk every night after dinner. I started adding strength training twice a week this week. So far I've lost 15 lbs and my waist is a lot smaller. Meals look like salmon and broccoli with edamame, braised turkey breast with green beans and butternut squash soup, shredded cabbage and carrots with eggs etc. I eat fruit like blueberries or raspberries after my meal and if I eat other carbs I eat my fiber and protein first. I add healthy fats like sliced avocado, olive oil and nuts/seeds. Good luck on your journey!

9. u/rmjHonda [score=1, created=2025-11-08T09:17:39]: You can’t be healthy with visceral fat it’s just the truth - stop eating gluten wheat and grains find healthy protein and carbs fats - it’s so much more than just sugar it’s a metabolic pathway Dr William Davis has SO much information a cardiologist gut specialists not glp 1 - he has a 10 day wheat free plan try it
10. u/Downtown-Marsupial70 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T08:26:52]: Get a CGM and see which foods spike you. Working on getting the weight off will help a lot as well as consistent movement. Start by walking 15 minutes after each meal. Try your best to get at least 7k steps each day then work your way up to 10k. Fast at least 12 hours a day then work your way up. So you’d go no eating from 7pm to 7am the next morning. Your best bet and what worked for me is cutting out refined sugar and carbs. Also read Fast Like a Girl and Metabolical. Both wonderful and eye opening books. I went from 5.7 in May to 5.3 in October but I was strict.
