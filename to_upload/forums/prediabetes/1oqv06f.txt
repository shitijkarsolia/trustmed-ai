===============================================================================

Hello, 36M. Over the past few months I’ve been battling with the dawn effect. I’ve been consistently having a morning fasting glucose anywhere between 95-105. I’ve tried everything to get this down, not eating 3hrs before bed, exercise after dinner, low carb diet, minimal sweets/sugars. I did intermittent fasting for a month with no change. I went 18hrs of not eating and had a reading of 100, like wtf. But once I eat, workout, all that stuff my levels will return to about 75-85 most of the day. I got an A1C test a week ago and it came back at 5.1 which is well within healthy range. My doc is like “you’re no where near approaching pre-diabetic status, you’re fine”. Backround on my health, I workout 5 days a week, very fit and muscular with 8% body fat. I do have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis but up until recently it never caused glucose issues. Any insight or help would be appreciated, thank you.

It seems like you are creating some health anxiety for yourself unnecessarily. It does not seem like you are stressing out your insulin function with those numbers. You are NoT prediabetic. Keep living your healthy lifestyle. If you are getting these early morning numbers from an over the counter cgm, it may also be somewhat inaccurate. Ditch it. Best wishes.

4. u/BlissCrafter [score=1, created=2025-11-07T08:02:49]: My endocrinologist said it’s just natural for some people. I never take my blood sugar when I first get up because it will always be elevated from where it should be. If it’s coming back down then you’re ok.

A1c 5.0 and 5.3 but bs 101 to 105 after waking and walking around. Body needs energy to move so the body releases stored sugar to help you wake up and go. You eat, insulin releases and clears the sugar.

Around 4-8 a.m. your body releases cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon to get you ready for the day, so blood sugar rises a bit. It’s basically your liver dumping out a little glucose. You’re super lean and train often, which actually makes this more noticeable because your glycogen stores are lower and your body’s stress response is strong. An A1C of 5.1 is excellent, you’re nowhere near prediabetic territory. If you want to blunt it a bit: • Have a small protein + slow carb snack before bed - something like casein with oats or chickpeas. • Avoid long fasts - going 16-18 hours can raise cortisol and make morning glucose higher. • Keep doing resistance training and post-meal walks - they help the most long term. • Make sure magnesium and overall carb intake are adequate - super low carb diets can keep stress hormones up. Hashimoto’s can slightly play into it, but probably not in the way you’re thinking. When thyroid function slows down, metabolism and insulin clearance can too, which sometimes nudges fasting glucose a bit higher. But your A1C and post-meal numbers show that your body’s handling glucose perfectly fine. If your thyroid levels (especially free T3) are well-managed and you’re not hypo, then the dawn effect you’re seeing is just a normal hormonal rhythm, not a Hashimoto’s problem. So yeah, Hashimoto’s might make you a bit more sensitive to cortisol shifts, but it’s not causing a diabetic pattern here.
