2. u/OkEnthusiasm9197 [score=7, created=2025-11-07T16:20:56]: Brown rice might spike you. And carrots, in moderation but otherwise looks good. Is the non fat yogurt low sugar?
3. u/hotheadnchickn [score=5, created=2025-11-07T16:37:36]: Overall very nice list! That said, I would not get vanilla yogurt - lots of added sugar, go plain. Personally I wouldn’t get the rice either bc it’s pure carbs.
4. u/withomps44 [score=4, created=2025-11-07T15:38:18]: That looks like our Aldi orders! Haha.
5. u/MagicalBean_20 [score=4, created=2025-11-07T16:45:19]: That is pretty close to my own list. I can eat the brown rice is moderation (1/4-1/3 cup cooked) when mixed with sufficient protein. I like to make a Greek chicken bowl with it (grilled chicken, pickled red onion, tomatoes, cucumber, spinach, yogurt tzatziki sauce and a small amount of hummus).
6. u/drakered9 [score=3, created=2025-11-08T04:42:42]: Get plain non fat yogurt. I saw adding 1 teaspoon of flaxseed oil to yougurt or brown rice or oats have less spike. Flaxseed oil gives healthy fat with less saturated fat content.
7. u/DonaldYaYa [score=2, created=2025-11-07T16:32:38]: Maybe rice and beans. Each person is different though.
8. u/Winter-Language1428 [score=2, created=2025-11-07T19:01:09]: Hands down, I am eliminating cottage cheese.
9. u/Humble_Visual8300 [score=2, created=2025-11-08T19:01:54]: If you are in the US: The fresh salad. Aldi's gets a lot of recalls on their fresh salad greens. I don't buy salads there. The brown rice is probably not the best. Quinoa would be better, but be very careful to have small serving sizes. The beans are good, but again, be mindful of serving sizes. Everything else looks good to me.
10. u/Roobeesmycat [score=2, created=2025-11-09T07:25:38]: Hey if you want to eat the rice you can cook it and then freeze it in a ziplock bag. Rice freezes well and it will make resistant starch by having been cooled down. It shouldn’t spike your blood sugar when you reheat it. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26693746/
11. u/BlissCrafter [score=3, created=2025-11-07T16:17:41]: Chicken breast. I only eat fish.
12. u/aprilmofo [score=1, created=2025-11-07T17:48:13]: I’d skip the yogurt, but it’s not too bad with added sugars (I think 8g) - I use fage Greek plain 2% and add a tbsp of cherry jam which is 12g sugar, but the protein and fat seem to negate it and I have little to no rise in my numbers from it, eat it daily most of the time. Everyone is different though. I haven’t tested brown rice because I’m not a rice fiend and have just been generally avoiding it lol
13. u/kimariesingsMD [score=1, created=2025-11-07T18:33:58]: I would skip the bean soup and get whole milk Greek yogurt
14. u/Extreme-Donkey2708 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T20:17:58]: Personally I would not get the yogurt (I only have plain Greek, flavored is loaded with sugar), the rice and the soup mix. I love soup and love to cook so I made my own and control what is in it
15. u/ImNot4Everyone42 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T20:20:35]: Cottage cheese, but only because I hate the FF brand…
16. u/SierraMountainMom [score=1, created=2025-11-07T22:06:34]: The carrots, rice, and probably the bean soup.
17. u/Impossible-Donut8186 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T22:11:21]: I'd first like to say we are all unique and test differently. Plus, some like myself have other contributing issues. I would not eat any of the dairy or the brown rice. Nor would I eat the avocado but this one isn't a dietary choice. I've tried eating avocados multiple times, but fail to enjoy it.
18. u/-thankyouforthevenom [score=1, created=2025-11-08T00:14:43]: avocado😖😖😖😖
19. u/UtexBirder [score=1, created=2025-11-08T04:34:03]: The cottage cheese tastes good but is highly processed so I’d eliminate that. I eat Daisy brand but have to go elsewhere to buy it.
