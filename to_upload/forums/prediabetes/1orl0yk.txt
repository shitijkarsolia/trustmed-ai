===============================================================================

Has anyone heard of these diets. I remember back in the day when Dr John McDougall MD was popular (RIP), a lot of people were on these high starch, whole foods low fat diets claiming that it helped them regain their insulin sensitivity and reversed their insulin resistance long term. It takes some time and causes weight gain initially but works long term (according to people on it). The theory was that you have to do to high carb low fat (long term gain) or high fat low carb (short term gain, long term metabolic stress). Doing high carb, high fat is an issue as fat coats the cells or insulin receptors, preventing the sugars being taken up into cells, leading to high blood sugar. I guess this sort of makes sense but I can’t find much research saying exactly this and I didn’t learn it in med school either. From my understanding, a whole foods diet (if we really were to only eat what we could naturally forage and hunt) would naturally contain complex carbs, some proteins and not that much fats, so a keto diet always just seemed too far fetched for me and same with a diet without any meat. I’ve bought my meal prep for next week, it includes Korean eggs and quinoa for breakfast, tuna pasta for lunch, and chicken breast and potato for dinner. I guess pasta isn’t really a whole foods .. but otherwise, if I stick to it it’ll definitely be the healthiest week of eating I’ve probably had in my life.

I’ve been dealing with insulin resistance since last year and went this route over the summer and initially you will spike but give it some time and your body will adjust and you will handle carbs well! I’d suggest Mastering Diabetes, book and their YT channel. Turns out my underlying issue is my hormones and now that I have that fixed I’m behaving completely normally to food in general. But this way of eating did help in the interim.

If you look at extremes, saturated fats and simple carbs are the ones we need to avoid or restrict. Most other foods are fine. If you're not 100% sure what to choose, maybe check with a food coach app like glucospike ai.

Following low fat and whole food brought down my A1C from 5.6 to 5.0, lost 30lbs, my IR went down, no more hypertension, healthy cholesterol, best of all sleep apnea vanished. Food cravings are gone. Yes it works! Edit: typo.
5. u/EdwardBlackburn [score=2, created=2025-11-08T06:20:37]: Keto is pretty much impossible when you're talking about a natural diet (what someone would forage/hunt), yeah. Maybe, MAYBE if you lived in the arctic. I think it can be really helpful for some people but it definitely wouldn't be something you'd find in nature. Animals just don't have enough fat when they're wild, and high fat plants (avocadoes, coconut) come with enough carbs to prevent keto. I do think there's something to high carb low fat (and they really mean low fat, so a whole foods diet may not necessarily cut it; if you're including nuts and avocado or too many eggs then it might not work as intended). But yeah, there's no intervention that works for *everyone*, so we all gotta do whatever we gotta do. For some of us that will probably be low carb/keto. I'm currently trending in that direction because blood sugar spikes really mess with my mental health, personally. Good luck! It works for a lot of people who stick to it. Hope it works for you.
6. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=3, created=2025-11-08T07:11:28]: That diet is what causes most T2D. If you want to reverse T2D and insulin resistance, completely reverse that diet. Eat as few carbs as possible and replace those calories with fat. And no, eating fat does not make you fat (the opposite actually) and dietary fat does not float around in your bloodstream and clog up your arteries. That is not true and was never true. Fat is an essential nutrient, carbs aren't even essential.
