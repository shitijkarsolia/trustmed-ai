===============================================================================

Started bulking(dirty) last year since i'm a naturally lean person. I went from 193 Lbs to 215 Lbs. Obviously was still working out. At 215 Lbs, I started having alot of what seemed like schizophonia... Audio hallucinations. So around this time, my neck had gotten bigger and I was dealing with what i assume was undiagnosed Sleep Apnea. So I can attribute the hallucinations to lack to quality sleep. Anyways, 3 months ago. I got diagnosed with prediabetes(5.7 A1C). Around this time I weighed 210 Lbs( I started my weight cut). I got into a keto/intermittent fasting(16:8, eating twice a day) diet plan while fasting for 24 hours at the end of every week. For the first month I was strict on my keto diet. Didn't eat at restaurants, ate mostly egg, salmon, avocado, red meat, tilapia, boneless Chicken, broccoli. Making keto meals i learned on youtube(heavens kitchen keto), walking for 10 mins after meals consistently. Second month i loosened my grip slightly and started eating out for dinner when I got lazy and only cooked lunch for the week. End of 2nd month, reintroduced decent amount of carbs in my diet due to having lost 30 pounds and not wanting to go below 180 Lbs, I wasn't dealing with Sleep Apnea anymore. 3rd month, started eating slightly more carbs and drinking alot of low carb beers(coors light) with keto friendly cookies, eating out slightly more but still centered around fiber and protein as main diet. Went in for a blood test yesterday, Says I am now 5.0 A1C
