===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I'm new to Reddit and new to this group. Thank you for sharing your stories and your methods for lowering A1c, which have been very helpful. I'm 66F, 180 lbs, 5'5". Type 1 diabetes runs in my family and I've witnessed my father's struggles and later life complications. My blood sugar levels have been in normal range up until the last year or two. I was diagnosed with prediabetes in late August with 5.9 A1c, but ten weeks later I got my A1c down to 5.4 and dropped 14 pounds! Triglycerides went from 202 to 105. I'm feeling so much better although I understand that the changes I've made will have to continue for the rest of my life, and I need to get my weight down to 145 or better. I feel like my struggles were exacerbated by a bad case of Covid in October 2024. Since then, I've given in to terrible cravings for sugar in the forms of sugared soda, cereal and bakery. I feel like sugar became a beast in my gut always demanding to be fed. I was terrified when I was diagnosed with prediabetes. It explained some recent falling episodes when I must have been hypoglycemic but didn't know it. During the worst episode back in April, I was out walking my dog when I became disoriented and felt like I was sinking. I had to brace myself against a building not to fall. I got home and made myself some cinnamon/sugar toast and followed that with 3 homemade cookies and a ginger ale. I had no local doctor as I lived in a small town near the Mexico border. In June, I moved back to the midwest for better healthcare and I now have an excellent PCP. After my diagnosis, I re-read Sugar Crush by Richard Jacoby, then The Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes and Glucose Revolution by Jessie Inchauspe. I went cold-turkey off the sugared beverages and only drink water, coffee with milk and plain, hot tea. I stopped eating bratwurst and other junk at the ballpark and stuck with peanuts in the shell. Next, I started eating more salads and carrots and celery before each meal and cut out pastries and most bread, although I will still eat dark rye or heavily seeded bread on occasion. No junk or packaged, processed food. No snacks between meals and I stop eating by 6:00 pm. I plan my meals so that I walk my dog 20 to 30 minutes later, otherwise I do easy step exercises and light weights in front of the tv. I still eat ice cream every other week but trying to have that after a meal. These changes have been gradual and they have not been easy. Thanks for reading my saga. The journey continues...

I would go so far as to say that is was MOSTLY the quitting of sugar that brought your a1c down. I suspect if you stay sugar free, u can add back most carbs, and your a1c will stay at 5.4 or go lower.
