1. u/LMAquatics [score=1, created=2025-11-10T09:01:22]: Got one a few months after I started working on reversing IR. I just had an LPIR test come back positive but my glucose levels weren't too bad. Insulin was a little high so my HOMA was off, too. Used it more for feedback on my diet. Took a haitus from the CGM for a couple months and just started wearing one again to see if I'm staying on track. I have previously gone low carb/keto in order to get things back on track, but I have been eating a much less restrictive diet so I wanted to see if my numbers were continuing to trend in the right direction.
