===============================================================================

With a new diagnosis around the holiday season, I'd like to start collecting dessert recipes to try out. So far I found I enjoy stevia as a sweetener for me, and have been experimenting with that. I've made some almond cookies, a cheesecake from cottage cheese, brie cheese with fruit baked over it. Please share your sweetened recipes with me🖤 Protein cheesecake Recipe: (tastes more like a brownie to me, but I make mine as minis) •3/4 cup cottage cheese •1egg •1/2 cup sugar free chocolate chips •1 tsp vanilla •2 Tbs Sweetener •2 Tbs nut butter (I like almond) -preheat oven to 350F -melt the chocolate and set aside -in blender, blend cottage cheese, egg, vanilla, and sweetener -add chocolate and blend again -pour into greased baking dish -drizzle with nut butter -baked for 35-40 minutes

This is the base recipe I was using: https://selfproclaimedfoodie.com/old-fashioned-strawberry-ice-cream/#wprm-recipe-container-33161 I reduced the total amount of sugar and increased the amount of strawberries. I believe I increases them by about 50%. Instead of macerating, I made a jam with a list of it and macerated some. The output was slightly tarter but had a stronger strawberry flavor and everyone loved it. When I had it with proper care that is eat a whole bunch of fiber first. Don't eat too much on the protein heavy main course, have a small serving, and start moving immediately afterwards. It didn't even register in the CGM. Another thing to experiment was is cinnamon. I believe it is supposed to lower blood glucose and the smell causes things to feel really sweet even though it's not. Finally, use stevia to lower the overall sugar amount even more. I was considering making a compote and adding chia or basil seeds to increase the fiber content. Haven't done that. The last time I made it, I made it to the recipe although I added cinnamon. My wife didn't like it. Could've been the cinnamon in which case he careful and experiment or was at least partially the reduced strawberry flavor and increased sugar. The egg whites I made into an accompanying meringue. https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-swiss-meringue-recipe Again significantly lower the amount of sugar and add freeze dried strawberries. It'll hold the structure. I believe I used half cup sugar, half cup freeze dried strawberries with 8 egg whites
