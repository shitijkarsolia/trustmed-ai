(Just wanna state that i guess this is some form of vent so u dont have to read everything lol) Hi guys, last friday i had an appointment with my doctor about my OGTT test results and they were pretty bad. This time my insulin jumped from 3 to 230+ and stayed like that for almost an hour. To be honest its my mistake, cause the day before the test itself i had a bunch of sweets on an empty stomach and thats completely my fault. I need to ask on how do i like, learn to accept im very near diabetes and need to eat healthy? Because i genuinely cant. Im 16 and all of my peers eat unhealthy and its genuinely so tempting its insane. My parents try their hardest to eat properly when theyre with me but i see the candy wrappers in the trash. It all just makes me so angry. Why do I have to be the one that cant enjoy food like others? Nothing genuinely makes me happy anymore so unhealthy food just makes me forget about that for a minute. I hate it, my mom constantly makes me these healthy meals which i DESPISE: either awful/bland taste or horrid texture i cant describe. I have other health issues, i fit almost every criteria for PCOS and my insomnia has just been wrecking me for the last 2 years. I dont wanna pay a lot of money for healthy food, just for it to be mediocre. I wanna eat like everyone else but ill just get scolded at home. What the hell do i do? How do i approach this? Any advice helps

First, definitely get treated for PCOS, it causes insulin resistance and if your doctor or your parents aren't treating it seriously, be aggressive about telling them you want to find a new doctor. Treatment can help you lose weight too and may solve some of the insulin resistance problems. The only other advice I can think of is, if you know you're going to slip up and eat some junk food, try to eat the bland vegetables and protein beforehand. But you shouldn't have to solve with just willpower. Disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, but I've known people with PCOS and there are treatments that help.
2. u/rougeMBA [score=3, created=2025-11-10T05:49:09]: I'm sorry you're going through this. I was diagnosed a few months back and had a difficult time processing it, too. Here are the points that helped me: 1. About a week after my diagnosis I started thinking beyond the stereotypical chicken and broccoli meals.and figured out healthy dishes that were enjoyable. It sounds like your parents are supportive. Can you suggest a day every week or two where you cook with a parent to experiment with blood-sugar friendly meals? I go for stir fries with peanut sauce, shakshuka with homemade tomato sauce, almond-flour-based baked goods, and anything spicy. Use ChatGPT to take a flavor profile and turn it into a metabolically friendly entree. 2. Take it one day at a time. It's rough to eat something unsatisfying and think "this is my dinner for the next 80 years." It's easier to say "this is for today." 3. Keep in mind that you're young...while you may always be prone to insulin resistance, if you make big changes now, you may be able to relax in a few months once some insulin sensitivity has been restored. I've discovered after a few months of obsessive food tracking and exercise, I can eat carbs again and, as long as I take modest portions and exercise afterward, my blood sugar doesn't seem to spike. That isn't possible for everyone, but you may as well check to see if things improve after 3-6 months. 4. Gamify it. I created a scorecard to track whether I was improving my A1C or not. It gave me a bit of dopamine at the end of each day when I saw if made it into the green and incentivized good habits. Here's a copy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lSHQp1NsY_OvUmfxbNWcfJOFd9A88rijJO8Or4uAK1Q/edit?usp=drivesdk 5. I know it's probably tiresome to hear this, so I'm sorry for harping back to it, but you're young, and life can change a lot. You said that nothing makes you happy anymore and unhealthy food helps you forget that. Well, ten years from now you may well be in a very different situation. If anything, this diagnosis may help you kickstart new habits, by forcing you to exercise, experiment in the kitchen, or meet new people that opens doors. You're in a bad place right now, but don't assume it'll always be stormy just because there are clouds now. (I say this as someone who had a rather miserable time in much of grade school myself.) 6. Should have said this earlier, but walk or exercise after meals. It won't fix things by itself, but it helps a lot. Good luck!
