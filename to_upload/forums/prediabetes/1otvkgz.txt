===============================================================================

Hey all, looking for some breakfast ideas/advice. Right now my typical breakfast consists of: - 3 eggs - small cup of Greek yogurt - Slice of Dave's Bread or 647 bread. - Sausage links or Bannana - Glass of milk Im looking to maybe add in avacado or a protien shake but also looking for advice. I used to eat mainly cereal every breakfast prior to prediabetes so this has been a big change for me over the last few weeks. A1C is 5.8

Try variations: 2 eggs Avocado (or half) Dave's Bread Cottage cheese/scallions 2 eggs Tomato/Cucumber slices Dave's Bread Cheese Almond flour pancakes w/blueberries Low carb tortilla with scrambled eggs w/spinach and cheese Milk can spike blood sugar too. Better use half and half in coffee

3. u/Jade_Star23 [score=4, created=2025-11-10T21:01:27]: I like to sautée shredded cabbage and carrots in olive oil until tender and then mix in two eggs, scramble them and make a patty and flip to cook on both sides. You can season anyway you like or add avocado or hot sauce. Its very similar to eggs and hash browns. Sometimes I make turkey chorizo and eggs and eat with a low carb tortilla or add black beans for complex carbs. For yogurt I eat plain Greek yogurt, add glycine powder to sweeten it and then add nut butter and berries.

5. u/wildpoinsettia [score=3, created=2025-11-10T20:56:08]: I eat 100g of plain yogurt that I strained, so it's thick (Greek style). 30g of granola I made myself (oats, chia seeds, almonds, walnuts, cashews, unsweetened Coconut, vanilla, cinnamon) and sometimes I add a fruit. I've been using persimmons lately. I need something with little prep in the morning so no eggs or something that needs cooking. I feel ok until about 11:30-12. That's when I eat anyway.
6. u/rougeMBA [score=5, created=2025-11-10T18:11:02]: I mix two eggs with two tbsp ground chia seeds, a quarter cup almond flour, a splash of milk, and come cinnamon and ginger. Add a teaspoon of vanilla, maple syrup, and baking powder, microwave it for 90 seconds, and you get what I like to call Sad French Toast. More frequently, I make chia pudding the night before, but I add almond flour and shredded coconut to make the texture more palatable. I usually add maple syrup, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a teaspoon of vanilla to improve the flavor.
7. u/SwimAccomplished374 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T04:31:59]: Be careful with the banana, my BS spikes on bananas so high that I might as well go eat some ice cream.
8. u/NkleBuck [score=4, created=2025-11-10T19:50:55]: Why do you eat so much at breakfast?
9. u/Heavyypickelles [score=1, created=2025-11-10T18:12:58]: Could you swap your glass of milk for something like core power? High protein and lower carb. Costco has a really tasty keto granola. It’s great on yoghurt or apple sauce. Probably also good with milk. But I would use something lower carb like soy milk.
10. u/fishtacos007_ [score=1, created=2025-11-10T20:45:41]: I like to do chicken kebabs! I batch make a ton and freeze them. For my breakfast I'll airfry 2 kebabs, and have that with chopped cucumber, tomato, and whatever fruit I have on hand. Sometimes ill add in a slice of keto toast or a few tablespoons of no sugar added yogurt. (My favorite is Source vanilla yogurt with 10g protein). I've tried Greek and skyr yogurts but honestly I couldn't stomach the taste.
11. u/Major_Evidence_7850 [score=1, created=2025-11-11T10:58:00]: I eat some veggies like bock choy, carrots and mushrooms with amylus chicken sausage. I will sometimes use one almond flour tortilla to make a taco. Usually have two hard boiled eggs. Bone broth is great for protein. Sometimes I have almonds with almond butter or a healthier peanut butter. For the yogurt I would add some soaked chia seeds or ground flaxseeds with a small amount of blueberries or raspberries
12. u/SexySkinnyBitch [score=1, created=2025-11-11T14:28:10]: a banana would send my glucose through the roof! otherwise sounds like what I do minus the milk
13. u/PAVibing [score=1, created=2025-11-13T11:18:57]: Hey everyone 👋 I’ve noticed a lot of talk here about pre-diabetes and blood sugar management. I’m a registered dietitian who helps people prevent or delay type 2 diabetes through realistic, flexible nutrition changes — no extreme diets required. If you’ve been told you have pre-diabetes or your A1C’s creeping up, small, consistent tweaks can make a big difference. I run a private practice focused on this and am always happy to share tips or point you to good resources. You’ve got this — prevention really works. 💪
14. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=-8, created=2025-11-10T18:34:49]: If you want to lower your blood glucose, you'll have to ditch the yogurt (unless it's sugarless), bread, and banana, and be sure to drink whole milk.
