Hello everyone. I was wondering if anybody knows or has personal experience with whether secondhand smoke can affect your blood sugar? My sister and my niece smoke like chimneys, and I’ve noticed that the day after I spend time at their house my fbs spikes a bit. The first time this happened I chalked it up to eating too many carbs on that day. But it’s also happened when I’ve been very careful with my diet. Sorry if this is a dumb question; I’m still in the early stages of trying to figure out what messes with my blood sugar and what doesn’t.
