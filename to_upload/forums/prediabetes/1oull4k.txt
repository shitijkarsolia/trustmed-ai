===============================================================================

In early August, I had my first physical in six years after somewhat neglecting my health. I’m 5’10 24M and was 182 lbs. I lift and do cardio 3 days a week but my diet was not great as I was eating a lot of food and was stressed balancing my studies with my full time work. I tested my a1c and got a 5.7. I was definitely shocked seeing the results since I am young and workout and don’t have a family history of diabetes. After doing some research in this sub and online I cut all breakfast cereal, cutback on white bread and cut all sodas and juices. I also began walking around, doing squats and calves raises after meals. Today I tested my a1c again and my doctor shared that now I’m at 5.4! Hope to keep it that way by continuing my diet and exercise.

I didn't understand the severity of it and didn't have the knowledge now. Catching it early and understanding how to control it early is so important and makes a big difference. Congrats! Keep it up.

Fasting glucose was still 101 though which was disappointing because it was 99 when my A1C was 5.8. My doctor didn't seem concerned and waved off my concerns about the fasting glucose number only saying the A1C was more important and what we want to improve. Pretty much all my other lab numbers(lipids, RBC etc) improved and fasting glucose was the only one that worse. I fasted for 15.5 hours and did a 2+ mile evening walk the night before my 9am blood draw. My mom who is diabetic thinks fasting glucose can go up for some people after a long time of fasting like intermittent fasting. I can still lose another 35+pounds before I'm in the lean 20% or less body fat percentage so hopefully that fasting glucose goes down to 90 or less when I get to 180lbs.
