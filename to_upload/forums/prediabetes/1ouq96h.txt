Hello everyone! I am a little bit new to this so I want your help so that I understand what I should eat and not. Tonight I measured blood sugar before dinner and it was 91. I ate a sandwich with 2 whole grain slices of bread, mayo, mozzarella and lettuce with cherry tomatoes an some full fat free yogurt with two slices of dark chocolate 85% cacao. One hours after the first bite: 126 One hour and 40 minutes after first bite: 112 The spike was 33 mg. Is this okay? Should I avoid this meal?

How high varies by what you ate, and how long it takes to come down is a function of how well you make insulin, and how resistant you are to insulin. I recommend you go on your tube and search for videos on prediabetes by Jason funk, Robert Lustig, and maybe some other people here can suggest some good ones too.
