This is very niche but has anyone else endo or dietitian made you keep a food log of everything you eat? Every snack, every bite? Including amount, calories, carbohydrates, fat, protein, and fiber? I get it’s a good way of keeping people accountable but I notice if I just don’t eat my glucose won’t spike. It’s very triggering of my old habits of extreme restriction. It’s terrifying me and making me scared to eat. Anyone else?

No more counting anything or weighing myself ever. Instead I took pictures of what I ate and attached that to the Stelo app so I could figure out how much of certain foods cause spikes without measuring. After about 6 weeks I’ve developed an intuitive sense of what is “too much” without counting.

This was something I dealt with as a teen and it happened again in my 30s when dx. I had to figure it out on my own. Finally stopped losing weight. Maintaining now but its probably not gonna stop for long. Ugh. What a mess. This isnt talked about enough.
