===============================================================================

Hey everybody, sorry if this is a strange post. Background info — under 25M, 5’5, 124lbs, no family history of diabetes. Today my doc let me know that in my regular blood tests, my hemoglobin just barely entered the pre-diabetic range (5.7%), but said that he didn’t want to diagnose me just yet as the rest of my bloodwork, like my glucose levels (88mg/dL), looked perfectly healthy. Still, I want to be cautious. Is there a way that this lab work could have been incorrect (maybe I didn’t fast long enough before this appointment, error on the lab’s part etc.)? Anyone been in this situation before? There is of course the possibility that this is accurate, in which case, any advice? I’ll be honest about my sweet tooth/junk food habits and say I do eat some crap. Not too much, but more than I should. But rest assured I make sure to get my water, fruits, veggies, and proteins in! I just don’t really know where to go from here, as I’m also a college student eating at a dining hall for all my meals. I’m a little rattled but I know y’all are some kind and tenacious people, your support is really appreciated. Thanks folks 🫶

I wondered if maybe the reading was just stress I and could go about my life normally now that it was over, but decided to pull out the stops and treat it like an emergency. In the end, I'm glad I did. I got my A1C to 5.1 in three months and found that my insulin sensitivity ended up being pretty close to normal at that point. If I'd waited until it was higher I'd imagine it would have been harder to get to this point. Better to make voluntary changes now than involuntary ones later. Best of luck!

Even if you’re not actually pre-diabetic, that A1C reading *probably* means your average blood glucose is a little bit higher than it should be. Generally, this just means you should do what literally every American should probably be doing relative to dietary health: eat fewer simple/refined carbs (think sugar, bread, pasta, rice) and eat more fiber and protein. Even if you aren’t actually diabetic, this is just probably generally good diet advice. Ofc, I’m not a doctor or your doctor so talk to them first but generally most ppl could do to eat fewer simple carbs and more fiber.
