===============================================================================

I wear a CGM. Until recently I rarely went above 140. Figured a canned sugar free coffee would be no big deal. I was wrong took me from 100 to about 170! Looking at the can, I’m confused about what exactly spiked me. The only likely culprits I can see are the oat milk and/or the dates but I’ve had both before without any major spikes (not like this one anyway). Can someone tell me what’s so bad about the ingredients that would spike me so hard? I think I may have broken my pancreas finally. All my recent 170 spikes used to be &lt;140 just a week ago. I’m kinda worried.

2. u/Sparkysparky-boom [score=76, created=2025-11-12T15:42:44]: 29 grams carbohydrates with little fat or protein to balance them.
3. u/InvestmentCareful547 [score=22, created=2025-11-12T15:54:03]: Oats and dates for sure. Sugar water with blended sugar
4. u/CarlyJS18 [score=12, created=2025-11-12T15:36:16]: It's the carbs! Even when the ingredients are healthy and clean you still have to watch your overall carbs. I try to have healthy carbs for breakfast and lunch but never in a drink that isn't going to fill me up.
5. u/3boyz2men [score=13, created=2025-11-12T16:18:43]: Plus it's pretty high carb for just coffee. You are drinking almost 30g of carbs. That's TERRIBLE. P.S. It's definitely NOT sugar-free
6. u/sirphr1 [score=24, created=2025-11-12T15:35:22]: The dates? It says 10 g sugars
7. u/millenialshortbread [score=8, created=2025-11-12T15:35:50]: Dates and oat milk spike me, a lot. All of those things in liquid form (rather than raw dates or, say, oatmeal) also have a bigger spike for me -- something about the faster processing when it's something that doesn't need to be chewed. If this was my first thing consumed in the day I would expect to be spiking to 170 or 180, too.
8. u/PixiePower65 [score=27, created=2025-11-12T15:34:49]: It’s the carbohydrates. I keep total carbs under 20 for the day For coffee my best luck … You are better off using heavy cream and monk fruit
9. u/sciencenerd75 [score=6, created=2025-11-12T15:47:30]: The sugar and carbs combined. Not sure where all those carbs are coming from. Maybe from oatmilk and dates?
10. u/madogblue [score=5, created=2025-11-12T15:54:54]: Perfect storm: Oat milk carb city, and pure sugar dates
11. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=6, created=2025-11-13T01:36:15]: Are we looking at the same photo? Do you not see 29g of liquid carbs?! It it's not your fault. I can tell from so many of the posts here that people have been utterly conned and brainwashed by the food system. I'm not sure why you are buying coffee in a can, but there should be two ingredients in a can of coffee: * Coffee * Water Now if you did want a sweetened coffee (as a rare treat), then the thing to do would be to precede it by something with fiber and/or protein and/or fat and/or some form of acid.
12. u/spiniton85 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T15:50:26]: I'd avoid oat milk. It's oatmeal without the fiber. Almond milk would be a good sub.
13. u/BlissCrafter [score=5, created=2025-11-12T16:14:16]: I dunno. 10 grams of sugar! Maybe? 29 grams of carbs would be a carb heavy meal for me
14. u/rockilopez_ [score=3, created=2025-11-12T17:48:57]: 10g of sugar and 29g of carbs…. u need to be eating/drinking stuff w WAAAAY less of that
15. u/paradisemukbangpls [score=3, created=2025-11-12T19:32:42]: The problem is lack of fiber to slow absorption of glucose. Dates that are processed into juice like this + oats processed into oat milk = glucose spike. You would not have experienced that spike if you ate an equivalent nutrient amount in rolled oats or whole dates because the fiber slows digestion and thus slows the uptake of glucose. An easy way to fix this while still enjoying this treat is to eat something with lots of fiber before drinking this (e.g. have it after a large salad at lunch).
16. u/diduknowitsme [score=3, created=2025-11-12T20:01:51]: 29 grams of carbs is the equivalent of 2.4 tablespoons of sugar
17. u/SableMallorey [score=4, created=2025-11-12T15:42:27]: Probably the oat milk
18. u/UtexBirder [score=2, created=2025-11-12T16:20:41]: Oats dates sugar
19. u/Lost-Ear-2575 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T16:48:42]: 28g carbs… that’s 30% of daily limit. You’re done!
20. u/ivymeows [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:02:30]: The carbs, friend. Especially if not paired with protein. It’s always the carbs.
21. u/ReadEmReddit [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:20:28]: 29 grams of carbs is the reason! Unfortunately this beverage is not a good choice regardless of whether it “spiked” you in the past.
22. u/ProfessorNice3195 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T18:03:08]: It’s not coffee
23. u/PaintingLow2568 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T18:25:39]: 29 g carbs
