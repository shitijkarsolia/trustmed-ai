Hi everyone! Honestly, I'm so surprised (as I'm sure most of you were too when you found out) that I've landed here. I work out intensely 4 times a week, hardly drink, I don't smoke and somehow I'm prediabetic at 42mmol/Mol (I'm from the UK) or 6% for the rest of the world. Timeline: back in 2021 my blood sugar was checked in a routine test and it came back as 42 (6%). The doctor didn't even tell me so I didn't even know. Fast forward 4 years to early 2025, I took a routine blood test, came back again as 42 (6%) and this time it was flagged up with a text message that almost made me crash out. I just saw "diabetes" and freaked out. After speaking with the doc I then went on a 6 month change, I cut out all juice drinks except for the weekends, having maybe a glass or two of cranberry juice with limes on a night out (I don't drink much alcohol if at all). I dropped all cheat meals with cakes and sweet items to just one "cheat day". I lost a tiny bit of weight. I leaned out more. I felt good. Went back in after 6 months for another test aaannd...still 42 (6%). WTF?! Any of you have poorly designed bodies like this too? :( p.s posted on a burner so I can focus solely on this sub haha

It’s a genetic form of diabetes that has nothing to do with lifestyle, body fat, or how clean you eat. People with MODY are often lean and active and look like the last people you’d expect to have glucose issues. It’s caused by a single gene mutation that affects how the pancreas releases insulin, so cutting sugar or losing weight usually doesn’t change the A1c. A few things in your story fit the pattern a lot of MODY people describe: • A1c sitting at the exact same number for years no matter what you do • Lean, muscular, not showing insulin resistance • Very steady glucose profile but slightly elevated overall • Family members with “borderline diabetes” or weird glucose issues that never fit type 1 or type 2 There are several MODY types, and each one behaves a little differently: MODY 2 (GCK) This one is super common. It basically shifts your “glucose thermostat” a bit higher from birth. Your fasting glucose and A1c stay stable your whole life, even if you eat perfectly. Most people with this type don’t need treatment and never progress. MODY 1 (HNF4A) People with this subtype often have normal glucose when younger but develop higher sugars in their 20s or 30s. They’re very sensitive to certain low-dose meds and usually don’t need insulin early on. MODY 3 (HNF1A) Similar to MODY 1 but tends to show up a bit earlier. These folks respond strongly to small doses of sulfonylureas. Often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2. There are rarer types too, but these three cover most cases. If your doctor is open to it, you can ask about testing for MODY or a simple genetic panel. A lot of people spend years thinking they’re prediabetic when it’s actually a stable genetic pattern they were born with. Just something to rule out, especially since your number hasn’t moved at all despite changing your lifestyle.

I just view it as having “bad blood.” It’s very frustrating, especially when I ask my clearly obese friends what their latest blood panel results are and they are perfectly normal.

5. u/BlissCrafter [score=5, created=2025-11-12T16:57:26]: What is your iron level? It’s unlikely for you to actually be prediabetic. If your iron is low your hba1c can be high and have nothing to do with blood sugar.
6. u/Coixe [score=3, created=2025-11-12T19:02:18]: I see posts like this come across every so often. I must admit it’s discouraging. To think that I could bust my ass as hard as you and there’s no guarantee it will have any effect is crazy.
7. u/AggressiveAd4658 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T21:53:37]: Poor sleep? That’s a big factor for me
8. u/rumraisin [score=2, created=2025-11-12T16:50:43]: Same. I’ve been prediabetic for over 10 years at a BMI of 18. Can you get a glucose monitor? Prob the best way to figure out how to lower your a1c
9. u/hackworth01 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:48:44]: Genetics are tough. I’m a super active person and I’ve been dealing with pre-diabetes for a few years. One good sign is you’ve been stable for years. While 6 isn’t the best, it might not be that bad. If you get a glucose monitor (either the finger prick or even better a CGM), you can figure out what your glucose levels are actually doing. My understanding is anything under 140 (sorry, you’ll need to convert to UK units) is safe. Brief spikes above that with meals are normal and fine. Any meal should raise your glucose some. Exercise will likely raise your glucose but hopefully not over 140. It’s possible that your glucose levels are high but still in the safe range throughout the day.‘ You mentioned cutting out juices and cakes which are obvious sources of sugar. However it’s really all sources of carbohydrates, not just sugar, that you need to reduce. A good starting point is to limit meals to 50g of carbs and snacks to 20g. The glucose monitor can help you identify specific foods that may spike you worse than others. For me, rice is the worst followed by wheat and strangely corn causes the fewest problems. If diet change doesn’t work, you could consider going on a low dosage of metformin. I ended up doing that and it’s made the biggest difference. My fasting glucose dropped from 100 to 85. I still maintain a low carb diet and mostly restrict my cheat meals to in the middle of long exercise like bike rides or hikes where the exercise will keep my glucose under control. Remember that a pre-diabetes diagnosis is a wake up call, not the end of the world.

15. u/megapleb [score=1, created=2025-11-12T17:33:43]: It sucks. While I don't have your level of musculature or body fat, I am lean and have been lifting weights since I was a teenager. I have also always had a balance diet, and for the last 8 months cut down on a lot of carbs yet am my A1C keeps increasing. I'm at 5.9 now despite the change back in Feb when I was 5.8. The only thing I can point to is I don't sleep well, and that can raise blood sugar levels. How is your sleep?
