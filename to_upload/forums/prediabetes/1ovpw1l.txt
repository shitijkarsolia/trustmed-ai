===============================================================================

Long story short I had an awful time sleeping with caused me to go a while without meals and the foods I did have access to were carb/ saturated fat heavy. I can feel the prediabetes symptoms hitting me where after I eat my body is STARVING and my blood sugar is undoubtedly going crazy. What is something you guys do when you have off days to help mitigate these symptoms as quickly as possible? I’ve heard some people go for walks, some drink ACV, etc. Edit: Thank you so much for the tips!!!

So stay incredibly hydrated. Use the largest amount of muscles in your body which tends to be the legs, namely the quads, but even having the calve muscles flex together with quads helps which makes sense that walking mostly helps. Standing lunges or squats in sets of 10-12 helps. Pushups, jumping jacks, ect. Your muscles will help shuttle the blood glucose from your blood into your cells to be used for energy. So move. Even vacuuming and doing chores will help. If time allows, after being active try some teas like chamomile or peppermint or even dandelion teas (all subtly help aid in calmer blood glucose and stress) with sprinkle of cinnamon and lemon (lemon is acidic like apple cider which also brings blood glucose down). So hydrate, stay active, and then try to calm down (destress) after. This always helps. It’s like clockwork for me when I go overboard with the wrong foods.

However, if you got a set of dumbbells do a few reps, or push-ups in case you cannot go for a walk. Many people won’t realize this, doing push-ups will actually bring down the glucose even much faster than the 30 minute walk. This is useful when you don’t have too much time but you’re motivated to do push-ups. Lol.
4. u/OkEnthusiasm9197 [score=7, created=2025-11-12T20:05:10]: Going for a walk 30 mins after eating. 15 mins of brisk/moderate walk or so should be good. Or lift some weights to burn the sugar off. I think ACV works before you eat, not after but I might be wrong.
5. u/Prize-Parsnip6910 [score=8, created=2025-11-12T20:45:39]: After I eat, If it's too dark or cold to go for a walk, I do 30 squats, then I either do reps with 3 or 5 pound weights, or I pull the aerobic step out from under the couch and do 15 minutes of step exercises.

7. u/VashtiD [score=5, created=2025-11-13T09:19:00]: exercise, walk(esp with hills). Sometimes I eat a candy bar and then go to the gym. It is AMAZING how the exercise brings down my blood sugar (On my CGM). Riding statinary bike brought it down, and then doing the machines like the hamstring curls, quad extensions, leg press brought it down ALOT! I mean like from 130 to 77.
8. u/AggressiveAd4658 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T22:18:08]: 20 squats brings my blood sugar down v fast according to cgm
9. u/iced_coffee_242 [score=3, created=2025-11-13T06:32:17]: I walk if I’m able to, but if I’m not able to (at work, family obligations, etc) I do 15 squats and 10 lunges for as long as I have. No weights or anything, just slow and controlled. This is usually close to as effective as a walk
10. u/FreeEnergy6116 [score=3, created=2025-11-13T11:21:41]: I definitely walk, or I've found a task that has me moving around for 15+ minutes, like putting away laundry, helps a lot
11. u/Affenzoo [score=3, created=2025-11-13T16:47:01]: Walking brings it down very quickly, in minutes. If not possible, I turn on some music and dance for 5 minutes, sugar drops 30-40 units.
12. u/deathbyglamor [score=3, created=2025-11-13T17:50:38]: Squats!! 20-60.
13. u/Affectionate_One_700 [score=2, created=2025-11-12T22:54:50]: &gt; and the foods I did have access to were carb/ saturated fat heavy I'm trying to imagine the scenario. I can't. I will tell you that fat (saturated or otherwise) does not spike your blood sugar. This is very easy to verify with a CGM. To answer your question, I go for a walk, preferably with some steps through in. Bodyweight squats help too.
14. u/ACB_Toby [score=2, created=2025-11-12T23:03:00]: Movement! Doing chores, going for walks, lunges, I think full body movements are better.
15. u/MagicalBean_20 [score=2, created=2025-11-13T08:28:04]: Walking or weighted squats (glutes are the biggest muscle group in the body, so I find anything that targets them to be pretty effective).
16. u/churicador [score=2, created=2025-11-13T14:45:13]: Bodyweight squats, like 3 to 6 sets
17. u/Veryrandom4242 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T06:25:41]: Jumping rope - if short on time.
