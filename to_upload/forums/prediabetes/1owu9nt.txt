I’ve been tracking my meals and noticed unexpected blood sugar spikes from foods like flavored yogurt, protein bars, or “sugar-free” snacks. Turns out, they often contain hidden sugars such as maltose, dextrose, and even sugar alcohols like maltitol and sorbitol. For those with prediabetes, these hidden carbs can make glucose management much harder. Tips that helped me: * Read the ingredient list closely for names ending in -ose (like glucose, sucrose, fructose), syrups, nectar, concentrates, sugar alcohols (erythritol, xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol), maltodextrin, and common artificial sweeteners (sucralose, aspartame, saccharin). * Pick whole foods with fewer ingredients. * Add fiber to meals since it slows glucose absorption. * Pair carbs with protein or fat. * “Sugar-free” doesn’t always mean safe—sugar alcohols can spike some people and cause other issues. Have you noticed any foods that spiked your glucose even when labeled healthy? What swaps or habits have helped you avoid them? *For anyone interested in a more detailed breakdown, I wrote a longer article here:* [https://buttondown.com/beat-the-spike/archive/hidden-sugars-the-sneaky-spikers-in-your-healthy/](https://buttondown.com/beat-the-spike/archive/hidden-sugars-the-sneaky-spikers-in-your-healthy/)
