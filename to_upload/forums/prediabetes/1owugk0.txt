===============================================================================

About two weeks ago I had my A1c checked, and it came back at 5.6. After that, I started monitoring my blood sugar at home. Even though my fasting readings were sometimes on the higher side around 98 I managed to bring them down to about 80–88. If I ate late at night, my morning fasting numbers would be around 100–108. I still spike easily from sugary foods, though; I’ve gone up to 190 just from eating Chinese takeaway. It sometimes can take 3-4 hours for my blood sugar to go down to baseline if it has a lot of carbs, yesterday I had 4 dates after dinner(dinner was protein rich) and it took 4 hours to go back to baseline Yesterday, I had an OGTT done, and they also measured my fasting insulin, C-peptide, and A1c. Surprisingly, my A1c came back at 5.0 this time, with fasting insulin at 5.1 and C-peptide at 1.6. Which I guess puts my homa IR at 1? When they checked my blood sugar with a finger-prick, it read 78 (I woke up at 88, but I walked 15 minutes to the lab, which probably lowered it). The lab draw showed 70. After the 2 hour test, the finger-prick showed 130, but the blood sample came back as 111. Here are the results: https://imgur.com/a/tgkRkjD I previously had gestational diabetes, but all of this is just confusing to me. I do have a grandmother with type 1 diabetes, but there’s no type 2 diabetes in my family. Can I still have some insulin resistance or whatever going on?

2. u/LMAquatics [score=1, created=2025-11-14T10:12:24]: Your OGTT is going to be the most accurate indicator for insulin resistance. A1c is going to be a little less reliable because it's only measuring an effect of insulin resistance (sustained elevated glucose) without a relationship to insulin (OGTT by comparison is measuring insulin response in relation to glucose level and uptake). A1c has a margin of error as well, and medications or other health conditions can affect your results. A1c can change in a short period of time because the value provided weights your most recent glucose levels over glucose levels in the later part of the 3-month period. This is due to how red blood cells turn over in the body and other technical stuff that's beyond my HS level of biology education. Also, the margin of error inherent w/ a1c tests can be a factor when comparing 2 results. I have read that a1c margin of error can be up to .5%, but the way studies define "margin of error" isn't the same, so .5% may be an uncommon worst-case scenario. HOMA is a good indicator but has caveats and pitfalls. Since it's using a single glucose and insulin draw and those levels can/constantly fluctuate. Usually HOMA isn't used as a primary test for IR. HOMA is also less reliable when insulin and glucose levels are in (or close to) normal ranges. C-peptide is usually used to determine if your beta cells are functioning correctly and if your abnormal glucose levels are due to insulin resistance, insulin insufficiency, or both. Generally speaking, OGTT is often considered second most reliable (gold standard is the insulin clamp which is complex and not really used outside of research) as it's measuring all aspects of identifying insulin resistance (glucose uptake over time in relation to insulin response) so you're probably safe in going by that result alone. The main caveats with OGTT is it is not 100% reliable in identifying peripheral/whole body insulin resistance (for example, you may have insulin resistance in the liver that affects cholesterol production but may not present in glucose levels), and your results can be skewed by a transitory case of insulin resistance (ie not getting enough sleep the night before can induce a short period of IR that normally resolves quickly).
