I think some of us may be overdoing it with the low-carb diet. I asked Google AI what is a "starchy vegetable" and got this response: A **starchy vegetable** is a vegetable that contains a higher amount of starch (a type of complex carbohydrate) and calories compared to non-starchy vegetables. They provide energy and are excellent sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Common examples of starchy vegetables include: * **Potatoes** (white and sweet varieties) * **Corn** * **Peas** (green peas and lima beans) * **Winter Squashes** (acorn, butternut, and pumpkin) * **Legumes** (dried beans, lentils, and chickpeas are often grouped with starchy vegetables in dietary guidelines) * **Root vegetables** like yams, parsnips, and cassava While healthy, starchy vegetables have a greater impact on blood sugar levels than non-starchy vegetables due to their higher carbohydrate content. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) generally recommends that starchy foods make up about a quarter of your plate at main meals to help manage blood glucose levels. For reference, non-starchy vegetables include options like broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini.

Of course, that changes when they are loaded up with saturated fats (butter... sour cream... cheese...), but on their own, whole and unprocessed, they are fantastically healthy. And you are correct that carbohydrates are improperly demonized. You and I will be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, so be prepared. I have come to truly love a (close to) whole food, plant based diet. My tastes have actually changed, and I \*CRAVE\* healthier, unprocessed foods with much less fat, salt, and sugar. Sweets taste too sweet, now. My pancreas has recovered a bit - I am less insulin-resistant. For example, the pasta that I had earlier today (with a DELICIOUS, simple, fresh tomato sauce) barely moved the needle. Avoiding "carbs" and then claiming the problem is resolved is like turning off the water on a leaking sink and claiming the problem is solved: "I just won't use that sink". We are designed to eat grains, vegetables, and fruits; when we don't, the problem can, in fact, become WORSE (and the reasons why are many). Whereas I can now eat a big fat steamed potato or a plate of pasta without incident, if I had been doing low-carb, I would spike to high heaven if I even LOOKED at those things. The first-phase release of insulin (which is insulin kept on-reserve for the next meal) won't be able to handle "a carb" if it has been trained never to expect any... There's a reason the experts recommend BALANCE.
2. u/EggieRowe [score=4, created=2025-11-15T05:27:44]: Nothing wrong with starchy vegetables, but a lot of them are prepared with an excessive amount of fat - buttered, fried, creamed, bacon drippings, etc. - which makes it easy to eat excessive amounts. Nothing worse IMHO for pre-diabetes/IR than a combo of high carb and high fat.

4. u/Queen-Clio [score=1, created=2025-11-15T08:09:31]: Just an fyi, corn, peas, and legumes aren't vegetables. But if they have complex carbs and fiber then they're generally going to mess with your blood sugar a lot less than straight starch/sugar, plus legumes have a lot of protein!
5. u/Paranoid_Sinner [score=-5, created=2025-11-14T21:41:22]: LOL @ the ADA. If you have high blood sugar, the worst thing you can do is keep eating carbs -- which is what caused the high sugar levels in the first place. Yes carbs **can** supply energy, but are not necessary if you replace carbs with fat. And no, dietary fat does not clog your arteries.
