===============================================================================

I got my prediabetic diagnosis in March, a1c was 6.3 and my doctor said I needed to get serious about managing blood sugar and losing weight or medication was coming soon. That scared me enough to actually do something about it. I made diet changes and started walking daily but the cravings were making everything way harder than it needed to be, especially in the afternoon and evening when my blood sugar would drop and I'd want to eat everything in sight, so I decided to try some supplements specifically for blood sugar management and appetite control. I tested these three over about 9 months total (12 weeks each): Glucocontrol: Berberine based supplement that's supposed to help with blood sugar. It cost around $45 a month. Honestly I didn't notice much difference in cravings or energy levels, maybe helped a tiny bit with blood sugar but hard to tell since I was also changing my diet. Stopped taking it after 12 weeks because it wasn't worth the cost. Muniq shake: Fiber based meal replacement shake. About $80 a month which felt really expensive. Tasted okay, did help with fullness for a few hours but the sugar cravings were still intense. I also got tired of drinking shakes instead of eating real food. The fullness wore off pretty quick and then I'd be starving again. Ozzi drink mix: Konjac fiber and chromium supplement specifically for cravings. Around $70 a month. This one actually made a noticeable difference for me, the afternoon crashes are way less intense and evening snacking urge is manageable now instead of overwhelming. But as I said I’m not the biggest fan of just drinking stuff, so I’m a bit torn on this one. My honest take is that supplements alone won't fix prediabetes, you still have to eat better and exercise (obviously). But having something that makes the cravings less intense makes it a bit easier to actually stick to the lifestyle changes. The first two I tried didn't really help much but the third one has been solid for managing the mental battle with food. But at the end of the day everyone’s different so you’ll have to see what works for you
