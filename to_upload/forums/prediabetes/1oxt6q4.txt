===============================================================================

I just got back my A1c results and I am finally out of the prediabetic range! Back last year, I was told that I was borderline prediabetic. At that time, I gained freshman 20 in less than a semester. I look back at what I was eating and yikes. I was having frappes and lattes everyday with pastries. I would have a juice or a soda with every meal I was eating. I had desserts and all sorts of fried foods. Honestly, it's no wonder I became prediabetic. During the summer, I saw a Tiktok talking about how prediabetes should be treated more aggressively, and it got me a bit scared. So I decided to get do an at home kit A1C test. I found out I was 6.3 in August. Looking back, it was probably higher, seeing as many at home kit A1c tests are not accurate. I went down a rabbit hole on diabetic complications and I started getting really anxious. I ended up finding this subreddit which gave a lot of great advice. So what did I do? I think weight loss had the biggest impact. I lost about 20 pounds. I also incorporated walking after every meal for at least 10 minutes. For my meals, I stopped drinking sodas and juices and switched to whole grain options such as brown rice and whole wheat bread. Every now and then, I would indulge in an energy drink or a diet soda. I increased my amount of fiber and I ate in a specific order, fiber, protein, and lastly carbs. This is a bit controversial in this subreddit, but I also did intermittent fasting. I would fast for at least 18 hours and then eat. I'm going to be honest, I had quite a number of cheat days. Every now and then I would indulge in some pastries or french fries (my guilty pleasure). Also, my culture loves rice, so I didn't cut that out entirely either :) but my overall diet and portion control had significantly changed. Now, I just need to maintain my levels. I wish everyone the best of luck on their own journeys :) !
