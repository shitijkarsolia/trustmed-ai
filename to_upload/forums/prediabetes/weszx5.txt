===============================================================================

This is a draft! I welcome the community's criticism. :) Most likely you have joined this sub because your doctor informed you that you're pre-diabetic. **What does this mean?** * Medically, this means that your latest **Hemoglobin A1C** reading or readings are above 5.9% (the threshold may vary slightly for different medical establishments). * My non-medical opinion is that being pre-diabetic simply means that your body is gently telling you that you should change your lifestyle. You're probably not in any immediate danger if this is your only health indicator of concern, but you should make changes now. **What are your next steps?** * Being pre-diabetic is not the end of the road for you. Reframe how you think about this diagnosis. You are being given a chance to fix this, and with a lot of work and positive energy, you can reverse this, or perhaps more accurately, achieve a state of healthy remission as long as you make a permanent lifestyle change. * This is a support group. It's not intended to offer medical advice. The first step is to speak with your doctor about your medical next steps because everyone's body is different, and your own path to remission may require specialized medical advice. In the meantime... 1. Stay calm, and respect your body. 2. Cut out sugars (simple sugars, starches, and highly processed foods) as much as reasonable. 3. What works for me? I got a blood glucose meter and gamified (turned a mundane task into something fun) my lifestyle change by always ensuring that my blood sugar stays in range. This means that I am always aware that if I eat this sweet food, will it send my next reading out of range? This has worked well for me. 4. Most doctors don't talk about exercise, rather, they focus on food choices. But for me, increasing my fitness has done wonders. I have literary increased my walking steps from a pathetic 2000 steps per week, to 35000 or more steps per work. 5. Just losing 15lbs (8kg) may have a significant positive impact on your overall health. Set a goal to lose this much weight in 3 months. It's important to always set realistic goals. Then repeat this goal over the next 3 months. &amp;#x200B; **Bottom line:** Don't stress out and be patient! I cannot emphasize this enough. You can manage the condition, you can go into remission, and it is even possible to reverse your pre-diabetic condition. Reversal or remission is said to be achieved if you maintain a normal A1C for a minimum of six months. But achieving this goal will take time and effort, perhaps even a frustrating amount of time and effort. Note: Your **Hemoglobin A1C** reading is also a lagging indicator that may take 3 to 6 months to show any changes after your lifestyle change.

I am not overweight (bmi* 22), don’t smoke, drink rarely, eat well, and exercise consistently. But if I eat toast with jam in the morning, my glucose shoots up to 155. If I eat the exact same thing in the evening, it doesn’t go above 130. And walking for 10-15 minutes immediately after a carb-heavy meal makes a 20-point difference for me. *bmi is bullshit for lots of reasons*
2. u/Jamezkoa [score=96, created=2022-08-03T12:15:54]: Just diagnosed a few days ago (borderline) and I am having trouble grasping it because I have been consistent eating healthy and active for the past 2 years and prior to that I was moderately active with an okay diet.
3. u/rphjem [score=59, created=2022-10-19T09:51:19]: An elevated A1C follows years of elevated insulin, which most Dr.s don’t test for. High insulin causes inflammation, fat storage, high blood pressure, more. Eventually cells become resistant then blood glucose begins to climb and then elevated A1C readings are found. If you have any symptoms of pre diabetes (increased abdominal fat, skin tags, darker skin areas on armpits, neck &amp; groin, sugar cravings, anxiety, PCOS, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, poor sleep) ask for a fasting insulin test even if your A1C is normal, and make diet and lifestyle changes that will make you feel better sooner than later.

4. u/[deleted] [score=35, created=2022-08-02T20:00:26]: Like the positive tone! Since you’re welcoming criticism - I’d say the repeated usage of “reverse” might be misleading for some people. I’m not sure this agrees with the medical literature or even the comments I see around here. It seems to imply this is something that you can tackle once (like a broken bone) and then go back to living like you were. At least for some people, this is not the case. I’m not even sure it’s the case for the majority of people. I prefer the term “control”, but there are probably other good word choices too.
5. u/balooladidit [score=29, created=2022-10-20T08:27:51]: Thanks for creating this group and posting such a gentle message. I haven't heard from my doctor yet but snuck a peek at my lab results and the big "!" next to the glucose random line item is alarming. I googled my numbers and per the internet, yup, prediabetic. Can't say I'm surprised. My best friend took her life a few years ago in 2015. My weight steadily climbed after that. Right when Covid came in full-force, I sprained my ankle and it took over a year to be able to walk without pain. I've been in a rigorous grad program the past 2 1/2 years and I live in Michigan where winter always slows me down. I struggle with knowing what I need to do but feeling, I guess, a lack of trust in myself to make time for the meal prep and dinners. Life is so busy. I typically throw something in the crockpot and walk away. This feels like "one more thing" I have to do, and have to do now, and I guess I'm working through my resistance and annoyance. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to right the ship here, but I'm not yet in the "gratitude" head space. Anywho, thanks again for creating a space for this.
6. u/ced1106 [score=29, created=2022-12-24T23:24:16]: As a retiree, I have the luxury of time: * Exercise: Get a treadmill. If you're bored, use the treadmill. You can watch YouTube, television, and Reddit's scroller plus a music channel helps. Walk the dog. Exercise after eating. Work your way up to 3mph. Cut out all other hobbies. If you wake up too early to walk the dog because it's chilly, that's when you do your chores. KEEP PUSHING YOURSELF. * Low Carb: Use a refrigerator calendar to track your meals, and plan them out a few days ahead. If you're bored, prep your next meal. Make lunch from leftovers and leftover ingredients if you don't like cooking. Trader Joe's and Costco have many pre-prepared low carb food, and search on "keto grocery list" for staple foods for recipes. Binder clips and clip boards to organize recipes, white boards to keep track of ingredients, prepared foods, and recipes you can make. * Intermittent Fasting: 12 hours of fasting is easiest. Exercise at the beginning of your fast right after you eat, and extend your fasting window with exercise and a shower, as well as wasting time on the internet. :P * Water and Tea: Easier to drink more when you add exercise. Also was easier to give up sweeteners for some reason. * Tracker: I use a blank weekly calendar to track various bits of information, as well as for calendar stuff. Using a tracker for your diet has been shown to be effective for weight loss. * Glucose meter: Inexpensive on Amazon. You don't have to measure your glucose level every day. Also, use a scale once your blood sugar goes down, since you'll be losing (water) weight. Myself, I had a blood sugar reading of 160+ earlier in the month, and reduced it to 93+ after a few weeks. It \*does\* take time for exercise and plan everything, but, as said, I'm retired so I have time and now have a routine that I can follow. I did start after a period of stress, and I expect working and/or having kids will make things less easy, but, again, KEEP PUSHING YOURSELF. Who needs hobbies when you're productive, right? :/
7. u/MeditatingNarwhale [score=21, created=2022-11-03T20:42:30]: I’ve seen that the majority of sources assume people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes are overweight and sedentary. But it is literally just a poor nutrition thing. Which can happen to active people too. And working out when your nutrition is poor is only going to worsen blood sugar issues. You should only work out if you are eating properly and regularly or else you’ll set yourself up for a blood sugar attack. Like me, I’m one of those people. I got prediabetes because I was anorexic in the past, and after I recovered my diet was poor and I was doing a lot of fasting and skipping meals ontop of living a highly active lifestyle. It got to the point where my body couldn’t handle the workouts anymore and my symptoms would worsen following physical activity. But my nutrition was so poor that I also had nutrient deficiencies 😞
8. u/juliejohnson4234 [score=18, created=2022-08-03T10:32:31]: FYI you can be diagnosed with high fasting sugars alone. Anything over 100 is considered pre diabetic. I am diagnosed and my highest A1C has been a 5.2.

11. u/Electronic-School580 [score=8, created=2022-08-03T10:21:37]: Thank you. I was diagnosed with prediabetes (based on glucose level) and metabolic syndrome yesterday. My HbA1c is weirdly in the healthy range, well just about - 5.4%. This is the wake up call I needed because I have been sedentary and eating junk for the last two years. Im not overweight but I’m skinny fat. I went to the gym today and will work to make this a habit. Im also trying a low carb diet.
12. u/[deleted] [score=8, created=2022-12-05T09:28:02]: Thank you for writing this. I'm pre-pre diabetic distinguished at 5.6 A1C. Where I live prediabetes is 5.7 to 6.4 A1C. I'm eating clean as of this weekend. Threw away all my chips and sweets. Getting cravings but not giving in. I'll have my doc run my blood in 3 months and see if it's too son to see changes.
13. u/HoyAIAG [score=6, created=2023-02-24T15:22:11]: It’s been a ride. Had a few high glucose tests. A1C was normal for years. Then in 2019 my A1C was 5.7, and I went on Metformin. Had 5.4 A1C ever since. Today my A1C turned up 5.9. I am pretty bummed out.
14. u/PHL1365 [score=6, created=2022-08-02T21:07:38]: Very nice intro. Perhaps you might want to talk about fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. It's very possible to have a "normal" A1c but high insulin levels. This situation is much closer to diabetes than someone with the same A1c but low insulin.
