===============================================================================

My(F23) father(58) got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few months ago, he's been really good with taking his medication and adjusting his diet to lower his blood glucose levels. One of my hobbies is baking, and my dad really enjoys trying the things I make. But those recipes often contain high amounts of sugar and ingredients that could cause a spike.... I've tried looking online for good recipes that are safer for him to eat without risking his health, but I've hit a point where the recipes just sound incredibly unappetising. I figured, who better to ask than those who (hopefully) know what is safe for them to eat AND tastes good. Does anybody have any recommendations? (TL/DR: I want to suprise my dad with diabetes friendly baked goods, but I have no idea what)

Most of the recipes require alternative flours like almond or coconut and sweeteners like erythritol or allulose. I really like her blueberry muffin recipe and cheesecake recipes

They also have a Facebook group and an Instagram. Most of their recipes are experimental, taking a non-keto recipe and making it keto. I'd say 98% of them are successful. They do a lot of quick, easy dessert type stuff, breads, stuff that would help diabetics like us (note that they are not diabetic, just keto). I've made a couple of their recipes over the last 8 months, and they're all pretty good!!

All starches are high in carbohydrates and tend to raise blood glucose. Whatever recipes you try I suggest he finds the safe portion size by testing at his peak (probably about an hour after eating) to see the effect. Ask him to read more here: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)
