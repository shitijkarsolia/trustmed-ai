===============================================================================

* 55 y.o. male. 6'0". 195 lbs. * 15% body fat; 158.4 lbs of muscle mass; 54.9% skeletal muscle * Excercise 3-5 times per week; cardio + weight training * Home cooked meals just about every day, fresh veggies, fruit, complex carbohydrates 8 months ago, CMP showed glucose at 102. Glycated Hemo showed A1C a6 6.1. I started modifying my diet and then traveled for 3 weeks consuming a lot of white rice, simple carbs, sugar. This was a month ago. Back on normal diet this summer. My fingers have been tingling with some numbness which has not abated much. Some days are worse than others. I have had a couple of skin discolorations (small, one on face and one on neck). I feel a bit hotter than normal and more fatigue. I'm getting more bloodwork done tomorrow. Worried about the news.

If not, ask the doctor why not because those numbers both indicate pre-diabetes. We cannot diagnose you, only a doctor can do that. While you wait for an appointment read this: [I Think I May Have Diabetes...](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2015/09/i-think-i-may-have-diabetes.html)

Since your having blood work done tomorrow you can just wait to see what that says. "...fresh veggies, fruit..." can be a problem, depending on what they are. What might be healthy for a normal person may be very UNhealthy for someone with T2D.

This should give you an idea of what's going on. Remember that only checking your BS once a day is a snippet in time. Checking your A1C is a good indication to dig deeper.
4. u/PacRimRod [score=11, created=2025-08-19T10:57:15]: Too much unneeded data there. Get a blood test, see what your fasting blood glucose is as well as your A1C. Those are the numbers that matter.
5. u/ephcee [score=5, created=2025-08-19T10:37:19]: Tingling and numbness is more likely a structural issue like carpal tunnel than neuropathy at this point. I suppose it’s always possible but it’s not a typical early symptom. Sometimes you can do everything right and your genes still have other plans. The good news is you’re already doing a lot of what you need to do. Do you consume pre-workout or a lot of caffeine? That can cause elevated numbers, really anything that raises cortisol/inflammation will affect insulin sensitivity.
