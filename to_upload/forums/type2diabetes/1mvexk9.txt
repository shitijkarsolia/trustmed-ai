I keep hearing about these programs but not sure if they really work. Curious to know from people who have actually tried them—what was your experience?

Bought there 3 months program for some 1300 rupees and saw good percentage of reduction in my HBa1C. For anyone in india, who is type 2 diabetic, i would suggest y’all should give it a try.

Particularly those focused on addressing the root cause, insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. Reversing insulin resistance is not only possible but has been achieved through specific lifestyle changes. Adopting a whole-food diet can significantly improve insulin sensitivity. Incorporating both soluble and insoluble fiber can slow digestion and reduce glucose spikes. Also, adding healthy fats into your diet, like olive oil and avocados, along with proteins from eggs and nuts, can enhance GLP-1. Our body naturally produces that hormone, and it helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. Time-based eating or intermittent fasting can help regulate blood sugar levels. That gives your body a break from producing insulin and allows your levels to come down. I’ve personally found a system that’s proven and patented to help reverse insulin resistance, and it made a massive difference for me. The only reason I started using it is because of all the science behind it. It boosts your body’s natural GLP-1 by almost 70%. If you ever want to hear more, I’m happy to share!

You can do all the "diets" you want but if you don't adjust your lifestyle to eating at home, getting a balanced diet, eating chevy portion sizes, and moderate exercise, you'll never keep it under control. Took me 2 years.

I was diagnosed with type 2 in January 2024 after going into DKA. My A1C was 16.9 and I almost died. Oh and at the hospital i was also diagnosed with perforated diverticulitis(may have been related to the diabetes) and had 7 inches of my colon removed. I had a colostomy bag for 6 months I spent 33 days in the hospital plus 7 weeks of at home PT to learn to walk again. My A1C is now 6.0 and I am no longer on insulin and just Metformin 2000 a day.

6. u/Negative_Joke_1912 [score=1, created=2025-08-21T23:03:13]: What has worked for me and many others is a whole food very low fat vegan diet. I know it sounds impossible to follow but I have found ‘we like the foods we eat’. When I started, I hated beans, I like them now! I eat lots of fruit. Today I had four bananas, cantalope, two apples and a fruit/soy milk smoothie. Definitely not ‘low carb’. I eat to satiety as well. Beans, whole grains, fruits, vegetables of all sorts, even rice are among the large variety of foods on my plate. This eating pattern is proven to increase insulin sensitivity, it has done that for me. I take no diabetes meds and have had a1c tests in the low 5’s for the past 20 months, diagnosed at 9.6 two years ago. Low carb is just one of many dietary options and perhaps not the best for overall health. Large medical providers (Kaiser for one) recommend a whole food diet. Check it out, I still wear my Dexcom but my diabetes is well controlled.
7. u/alan_s [score=3, created=2025-08-21T15:55:49]: There is presently NO cure for type 2 diabetes, thus it depends on what you mean by reversal. It is possible for some people to gain good control using appropriate diet, exercise and, if necessary medications or insulin. I have achieved that for over 20 years. That is well worth aiming for but it is neither reversal nor a cure.
8. u/Diabetesarmy [score=2, created=2025-08-21T14:30:27]: I gained 200 pounds on over 7,000 units of insulin a month. Now lost 175, insulin free and reversed mine. I now own a company that does this with others…will tell you this though m, it is all up to the individual to execute the play. One thing I have learned, and teach, is that it doesn’t start with nutrition but it starts with mindset. Without that you will never win….
9. u/Gottagetanediton [score=14, created=2025-08-20T11:39:16]: Reversal isn’t real. remission is. My diabetes is genetic so the thing that worked best for me was mounjaro. Been between 5.3 and 5 for 3 years.
10. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=0, created=2025-08-20T10:06:28]: The word 'reversal' isn't ideal as you can't change your genetics, and regaining a 100% healthy inulin response after a confirmed T2 diagnosis either never happens or is rare to the point that nobody has yet proven it can happen. If you can afford to lose weight then you can reverse insulin resistance in the liver through big weight loss and this may drop your fasting level. If you haven't been diabetic for too many years then big weight loss may \*partially\* reverse problems with the beta cells in the pancreas which produce insulin, but there's probably lasting damage that will persist. The combination of resolving insulin resistance in the liver and partially reversing problems in the pancreas may result in remission. How tightly a person has to manage their carb intake after that varies from person to person. 'Reversal' isn't a good word for this as it's only ever partial, though the word 'management' as used in many of the other comments isn't ideal either as it doesn't convey that actual physical improvement of the underlying disease condition and halting disease progression is possible. If any programs out there work they do it through weight loss and/or lowering carb intake. You don't need a program for that - any way to lose weight that suits you may work. Lose weight if you can afford to lose it, exercise, build and maintain muscle mass if you can as it may help, and moderate your carb intake to 'eat within your means' - that's what 'reversal' comes down to.
11. u/Destroinretirement [score=-2, created=2025-08-20T09:17:40]: Bears and hummingbirds go in and out of diabetic states so why can’t humans? I followed Roy Taylor - lost a ton of weight and my glucose levels normalized. I do not eat the way I did when I got obese but I do no thing special but eat healthy.
