===============================================================================

Hello there, My sister-in-law was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugar level was 12.5, with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. It had been over twenty-five years since she had visited a doctor. She has been smoking for around 30 years and still smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. She told us that her legs hurt at the beginning of May. After claiming that her foot was numb, she eventually visited a walk-in clinic in July. They discovered she has diabetes at this point. She has gone for two different kinds of ultrasounds on her legs. She eventually finds a new family physician; he requested that she undergo a CT scan to rule out a stroke. In a letter, he instructed us to take her to the emergency room (8-hour wait and 5 cigarettes). She goes to a vascular specialist in September. Her foot is still numb, and she still smokes like a fiend. My question is, do you think that she will lose her foot since she has not had any feeling in it since July? Has anyone have this happen to them?

I am glad she has an appointment with a vascular specialist. She should also see her new physician as a matter of urgency for proper treatment of her uncontrolled diabetes And she must give up smoking. Please pass on our invitation to drop in here after her appointments and also to read this: [Smoking and Diabetes](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2008/12/smoking-and-diabetes.html)
