===============================================================================

Hello all, seeking out some advice and guidance as just reading on the Internet doesn't tend to give out real lived experience. This morning I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and put straight on metformin twice a day. This seems to have really come out of nowhere to be entirely honest. I was having a fresh round of blood tests to see if my white blood cells and lipid levels had changed at all. Never before have I had a high HBA1c reading in all my life. For context I am a 31 year old female. I also had a vertebral artery dissection and small stroke two years ago, so I have been putting my cold/weak/numb left leg and foot down to that but I'm wondering if maybe it could be to do with the diabetes. My HBA1c levels on fasting was 59 (was 56 the month prior without fasting) is this really high? My main queries are, aside from the metformin, I obviously know I need to make some changes to my diet and lifestyle. I have recently heavily cut down on smoking. I don't eat an awful lot at all, but when I do it is usually carbohydrate heavy. Any ideas or recommendations for changing my diet? Things to avoid/add/cut down/incorporate? Also, should I expect any side effects from metformin? I'm going to struggle with taking it with a meal in the mornings as I honestly don't really eat until evening and don't have a massive appetite. Rest assured, since I've been really poorly and keep getting back such negative blood results, I am slowly but surely trying to make much better decisions with my lifestyle. But I'm really wondering just how much a poor diet and lack of exercise contributes to this diagnosis as like I said, it seems to have just come from nowhere and I can't even say I noticed any symptoms either. Bit of a ramble I know, very sorry for that. Just abit overwhelmed and bewildered and I guess I want to know how much this diagnosis is going to change and affect my life. Many thank yous in advance.

A1c numbers in brackets are for US readers. No, those are not really high but they are certainly diagnostic. Your diagnosis is corrrect but you are at an early stage and can take control of this condition. I wrote this to help you begin: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all. And give up smoking, read this to see why: [Smoking and Diabetes](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2008/12/smoking-and-diabetes.html)

I use it alongside Nutracheck to track my food and am steadily losing weight without needing to do any additional exercise. Wishing you the best of luck with your journey!

There’s a guy on you tube who also gives some great advice, search for Beat Diabetes a good eye opener to the disease.
5. u/SamforDH86 [score=3, created=2025-08-21T08:03:08]: Hi I was diagnosed in May this year and yes it is a shock to the system but like you I had no idea, although now I know I had several of the symptoms but you don’t know at the time. My Hba1c was 110 now 3 months later it’s down to 65 with diet and excersize alone, like you I was put on metformin twice a day, after one week I had to stop taking them due to side effects, so as we were away for a month I had 3 weeks taking no medication so I just made sure I kept the carb intake low and got 5000 plus steps per day. Since returning home my diet consists of mainly Fish, chicken, Turkey, lean Red Meat, no processed food, no rice, pasta, potatoes, fried foods, plenty of salad and fruit and veg, also small portions. I am now on a different medication one tablet per day, it would be worth asking your doctor if you can try a different medication as metformin in my opinion is not the best medication for type 2 although it is widely used (I am not a doctor but I have read so many negative responses to it). My advice would if your able to walk at least 5000 steps a day or excersize as much as your able to and drastically change your diet, keep positive, also if you can reduce weight I have lost 2 stone so far, any more info give me a shout be glad to advise. Good Luck.

I’ve been told the NHS considered an HBA1C of between 48-58 to indicate you have good control. So it’s not great and needs to come down but it’s not horrendous according to NHS guidelines.
