===============================================================================

I’m so freaking annoyed that my sugars are not going down. I’m hardly eating so I’m always in a bad mood. All I do is drink water. I have a Dr appointment tomorrow and I know she’s gonna be disappointed and that makes me feel terrible. I don’t know what to do.. UPDATE! Thank you so much for all the kind messages and advice. I got my meds adjusted and starting a glp1 so hoping for some better results.

Doing that can actually make insulin resistance worse. When your body is insulin resistant, it struggles to use sugar properly, stores fat more easily, and triggers stronger cravings. Fighting it with your willpower alone is like trying to empty a flooded house with a teaspoon. GLP-1 is a natural hormone your body makes to help control appetite and blood sugar. Instead of forcing it with synthetic drugs, you can support your body’s own production. I personally use an all-natural system that has been shown to boost natural GLP-1 by nearly 70%! It's been helping to curb my cravings, support weight loss, and improve insulin sensitivity, all without forcing or starving myself. The key is addressing the root cause, which is insulin resistance, rather than just trying to eat less. With the right approach, your body can start working with you again instead of against you. Let me know if you'd like more details.

But it’s so frustrating! I eat protein and vegetables. Less than 70 carbs a day. I drink a gallon of water. I take all of my meds on time, and track everything. And the numbers will not come below 140 no matter what. This disease sucks. It’s not easy to properly manage.
3. u/checker_nutz [score=1, created=2025-08-22T06:42:27]: I have started walking for a half hour one half hour after eating. I usually spike after eating. Doing the walk reduces the blood sugar by 30 points (for me). Also eat protein and fat first then wait 15 min before eating any carbs this reduces the blood sugar spike by 70% I am told. Adopt a keto like diet. Limit your daily carbs to as few as you can.
4. u/MelanieAnnS [score=6, created=2025-08-21T17:20:26]: If you don't eat that can also raise your blood sugar. Eat protein. Protein with no carbs. Or very little carb. Chicken thighs or peanut butter. No carbs. Then wait an hour or two. You should feel better.
5. u/mYstiSagE [score=3, created=2025-08-21T15:57:58]: No, don't starve yourself, and your doctor should not be disappointed (at least not too much). I an on insulin, and use a cgm; my last few days were bad where I struggled to get my numbers under 150. Absolutely stay hydrated, Not doing so can raise your numbers, but also being annoyed can do the same. Have a good discussion with things you can do, like eating protein with some fat and low carbs. Everybody is different; stay the course.

What are they and when do you test? &gt; I’m hardly eating There is no need to starve, but there is a need to know what foods and portion sizes are safe to eat. I wrote this to help you discover that: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

8. u/Round_Difference6938 [score=6, created=2025-08-21T12:45:11]: But you know, not eating also raises sugar. I mean because you aren't eating, u r essentially fasting, ur body turns to glucagon and ketone bodies to make some sugar in blood stream, so ur cells can feed. And if u r not sensitive to insulin ur sugar still raises. I'd say, like how others suggested, get a cgm, and try different food and see how they impact u.
9. u/Romaine2k [score=2, created=2025-08-21T11:07:21]: Get a CGM and take control of this. You probably have some food or drink that’s spiking you and you wouldn’t suspect it. I cannot drink milk at all, which I never would have known. And I can’t eat watermelon. On the other hand, I can have a small serving of potatoes with zero spike! Everyone’s body is different, you’re not going to know unless you have the information.
10. u/PacRimRod [score=5, created=2025-08-21T10:18:05]: What are your numbers? Remember also, stress and anxiety raise blood sugars. I saw gluten free and fruit, gluten is from carb sources which metabolize to glucose in the body. The most helpful thing for me was cutting out all grains and nearly all carbs. I had to give up fruit as well. Keto did wonders for me. Hang in there, it is a marathon not a sprint! Feel free to vent/post here, it is good to write down those thoughts and get them out. Best of luck to you!!
11. u/SamforDH86 [score=-1, created=2025-08-21T10:17:55]: In a nutshell reduce carbs, don’t eat any processed foods, don’t eat potatoes, rice, pasta, pizza, eat plenty of fruit and veg get your five small portions every day try to excersize every day 5000 steps minimum try this see what happens
12. u/pinkfong5678 [score=1, created=2025-08-21T10:00:31]: Take some time to prepare a list of what you currently are doing in an effort to bring down your glucose levels. If today is a “normal” day for you, write down everything you eat and drink, along with the times. Maybe that can help begin a discussion on whether extra nutritional support or medication changes need to happen. Don’t be so hard on yourself. I hope that you’ll be able to get a little more clarity from your appt tomorrow.

14. u/No-Mission2725 [score=4, created=2025-08-21T09:56:57]: Thank you for the replies. I am on a gluten free diet cause I have celiac disease also so I eat mainly meat and veggies and fruit. I also have a dietitian. I’m just a very big people pleaser so it is hard when I’m not doing good at something. My family just talks about me getting off the medication because it makes me sick. They also hate meds they don’t approve of it. So i also get frustrated that i literally can’t talk about it without being lectured out meds. I’m hoping my dr is kind tomorrow!
15. u/Snoozinsioux [score=6, created=2025-08-21T09:54:23]: Not eating enough will cause your liver to keep dumping stored sugar into your blood stream. Make sure you’re getting enough calories and nutrients, lower your carb intake over time (the reason we do a1c a minimum of every three months is because it takes at least that about of time to complete cell turnover) and try to build yourself some muscle. This isn’t a race. It took your body time to raise your levels, it’s going to take some time to bring them down.
