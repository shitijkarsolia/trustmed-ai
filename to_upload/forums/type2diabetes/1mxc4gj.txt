I've been diagnosed with type 2 for a little over a year. I'm 27M, I deffinitly had it for a while before my diagnosis. But man my hands and feet are always so cold. Doesn't help I work in the dairy section in my work but jeez. How do you manage if you're able?

3. u/CthulhuWatchesMe [score=1, created=2025-08-23T08:09:05]: This isn't usually an issue for me until fall and winter. I bought good quality thermal socks. Slippers around the house. Gloves when I'm at work (I'm outdoors a lot for work). Thermal insoles for my workboots. And a heated jacket imhas saved me shivering on even a mildly cool day.
