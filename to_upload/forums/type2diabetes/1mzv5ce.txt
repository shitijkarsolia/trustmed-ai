===============================================================================

I was diag'd w/T2D back in early May. I immediately started to devour every Youtube vid I could find on T2D and A1C, mostly from Dr. Berg and Dr. Davis. My initial labwork came back at a 6.9. As I got organized I took an At Home test to verify the baseline, and it was 6.9. I went on to clean up my diet and pay attention to what I was eating, essentially following Dr. Davis' advice: "Get rid of Wheat, Grains,, and Sugar". I added starches and alcohol to that. 1mo later I was showing some progress at A1C of 6.3, so going in the right direction. This morning I did my 3rd At Home test: 5.3. I'm pretty damned happy with that....just thought I'd share. For people trying to get into remission, it can be done. Watch the vids from those guys and follow their advice.

I would caution about following the advice of the typical information source you'll find on YouTube though. Dr. Eric Berg for example is a chiropractor, not a medical doctor, and he has 5,600+ videos on YouTube. He's very far from an expert on diabetes and given the wide variety and sheer volume of topics he posts about it's fair to say he's much more an expert in self-promotion than he is an expert in medicine. There is very little good material about Type 2 on YouTube though this long interview with Prof Roy Taylor is worth a watch. Unlike the great majority of personalities on YouTube he's an actual expert on Type 2, a professor of medicine, diabetologist and diabetes researcher: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbQvaE4VmJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbQvaE4VmJg) In the area of low-carb dieting Dr. David Unwin is a source of some good information, though if you look under the surface you'll find that Roy Taylor's science explains pretty much everything that Unwin has observed in his diabetic patients: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dShYGV1xM6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dShYGV1xM6w)

4. u/healthylifestyle_sly [score=1, created=2025-08-25T09:50:52]: If it helps, aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, stay hydrated. About 6.5 cups of water for women and 8.5 for men. Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. These small habits can make a big difference.
