===============================================================================

I just got the results from MyChart. I’m thinking it’s a mistake because I was fell off the wagon in May and June. I’ve been eating better and checking my blood sugar again since Mid July. I also got a Lingo CGM from Amazon I used to 2 weeks. My blood sugars sometimes were good but a lot of time they were in the 140 - 150 range for a few hours. I ate a bunch of popcorn once and it went up to 200 when checking on a meter. (Came down to 150 in 3 hours and 105 at 5 hours). I’m just wondering if it’s a mistake since my last A1C I checked with my primary Dr was 5.4 a year ago. Could it be a glitch and if pulled the result from last year? When my endo checked it in Feb it was 6.8. Granted I was off Mounjaro for a few months at that time. I’m on 5 mg now and was on it when I was at 5.4 last year. I’ve done intermittent fasting but only this last week so that wouldn’t change results.

3. u/starzela [score=1, created=2025-08-26T03:19:20]: Just out of curiosity were you experiencing a lot of lows?
4. u/darowlee [score=1, created=2025-08-25T21:09:28]: No, you're fine. Sounds like you're doing just fine. A few hours here and there at those ranges won't drive your A1C up much at all. Remember it's average of roughly 90 days worth of hours, not just the hours you're awake or eating.
