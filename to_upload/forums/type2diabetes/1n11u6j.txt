On my occasional visits to hospital I have found it simplest to avoid catgorisation as diabetic whenever possible and ask for the normal menu allowing me to simply leave excessive carbs on the plate.

They didn’t know if they wanted to replace it or not, due to her numbers. After a couple of days in the hospital they said her sugars were too high. I was there during breakfast. They gave her pancakes with butter and regular syrup, orange juice, a container of peaches in the sugar syrup sauce, and a bowl of cream of wheat. I then had to argue with a dietitian every single day for every single meal. The dietitian would tell her “ you can eat whatever you want baby don’t listen to her”. Now…I do understand she was a grown woman and should’ve known what she can or can’t eat, I get that. Still, as a hospital, they shouldn’t be putting all that in front of her.

They kept giving me fruit cups and after every lunch my sugar would be thru the roof cos I save my fruit till lunch and they gave it at breakfast. Then my dr scolded me for eating the fruit cups when he found out and I was like look here dude I’ve been diabetic for 4 days and I’m in the hospital , if I shouldn’t eat this stuff why are you feeding it to me
8. u/Defiant_Good9427 [score=1, created=2025-08-26T17:41:05]: That looks bad, real bad . Maybe speak to your dr and or the charge nurse about menu options cos that obviously is not fit for diabetes
