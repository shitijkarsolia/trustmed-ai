===============================================================================

I am type two diabetic with controlled sugars. But my feet get UNBEARABLY PAINFULLY COLD. I am in canada with minus 30 etc. I used to love winter but about 3 years ago now my feet get like incredibly painfully cold. Like I start crying at times, it's so so painful. It genuinely feels like I'm standing on a block of ice, it seems to all be centered around the bottom of my feet. Even short ten minute bursts outside can set it off. This past winter I got heated socks but they barely helped. This year I want to try heated insoles as they focus on the bottom of my feet. But is there an actual solution to this problem?? I do a lot of outdoor work in winter and I honest to God could not do it last winter and I really want to be okay this winter. Hoping people have some solutions.

A lot of them seem to be stretchy and spendexy but you could probably wear them as a base layer under thicker socks (maybe ask a Dr for sure about that) or I’ve seen some made out thick wool too.
