3. u/captainbkfire82 [score=2, created=2025-08-27T08:51:58]: That looks delicious! I love breakfast sandwiches like this. Also that Slap Ya Mama seasoning is so good on eggs. Nice balance of protein, fat, &amp; fiber here.

6. u/PacRimRod [score=-4, created=2025-08-27T08:00:25]: Is this a commercial? Many of us, myself included, cannot eat breads or grains. This is an odd post here.
