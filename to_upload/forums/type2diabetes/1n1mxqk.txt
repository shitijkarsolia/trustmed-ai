So with winter coming and the days getting shorter, I've been doing cardio after dinner in the early evening but I can see that becoming a problem over winter. Is doing it during the day less effective and being less active after dinner going to push up my numbers? I do have a treadmill and probably will turn to that but it's easier on my knees if I can just run outside and looking at how to plan for the winter.

I haven’t done this recently but I did in my 30s, swimming before work then eating my first meal around 11am and I lost a load of weight.

The only thing I have done differently between last year's blood test and this year's blood test was start walking 45 minutes a day in the morning and then because I sit at a desk all day, I get up and walk 300 steps every hour just to get my body moving. My A1C went from 5.6 to 5.4 and I lost 50lbs. For reference, I've been off all type 2 medications since Dec 2019 and managing with only diet &amp; exercise.
