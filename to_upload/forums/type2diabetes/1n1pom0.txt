Hi everyone - made a post earlier this week in just seeking advice. I take 3 metformin a day 2 in the morning and one at night, every time i eat something carby whilst taking metformin like fries etc i feel really sick and bloated, im emetophobic and also have bad anxiety so i don’t know if those symptoms are exacerbated by that factor. I took two this morning, ate two crumpets then felt nauseous a few hours later and the same has happened this afternoon after i ate my lunch however i haven’t took any more metformin as i wasn’t sure of this is why. Any advice would be greatly appreciated i’m panicking a lot wondering if something deeper is going on 😢

If you eat carb heavy meals while taking Metformin, you’re definitely going to notice changes in your lower GI system. Google “how does Metformin work” and this will be the third answer: “Slowing down glucose absorption in the intestines: Metformin slows down the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose, reducing the amount of glucose that enters the bloodstream.”

Really? Are you testing after meals? My blood glucose would spike into the stratosphere if I ate that for breakfast. Please try this technique for a week or so: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

"Doctor, it hurts when I do this"..."Then stop doing it" Reducing carbs will not only likely reduce or eliminate your nausea but it will help your overall disease management. In my case I strictly limit simple carbs and keep my intake of all carbs to about 100 grams per day. This helped me reduce my Metformin Rx from 1000x2 to 500x1. It takes focus at first but once you break the carb cycle of spikes and crashes it gets pretty easy. eta: I limit carbs to 25-30 per meal. Haven't had any nausea or the other problem later.

For 2 months I've been taking once a day (1000mg in the morning) and in the beginning it made me really sick when I had carbs or sometimes other foods. But it eventually went away. I dont know if this had anything to do with it, please ask your doctor, but probiotic yogurt really helped with my nausea and my gut health. Just don't have too much at once or too often cause most of those yogurts have a ton of sugar and like I said please talk to your dr first if this is okay for you! I do help you feel better soon. I know how you feel!

8. u/persephypeach [score=2, created=2025-08-27T12:34:46]: I take 4 a day - 2 in the am and 2 in the pm. I noticed that if I eat carby /junky food, then it hits really bad. If I eat protein and whole foods, then I have no stomach issues at all. Are you on the extended release? If not, you should ask to be switched as I know a lot of people have had much better luck with it.
9. u/RevolutionaryPie5077 [score=2, created=2025-08-27T12:02:47]: I've found that metformin makes me feel more ill in between meals, I would suggest taking one in the morning and two with dinner (after your biggest meal) that's what my pharmacist suggested! I feel your pain - im emetophobic too!
