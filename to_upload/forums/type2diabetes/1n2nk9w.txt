===============================================================================

Hey there. A little over three weeks ago my doctor told me I was diabetic based on two fasting blood glucose in the 130s. My mom was t2 so I just accepted that. I was supposed to get an a1c done but for whatever reason they didn’t do it and at the time I didn’t really know to ask. All my numbers were good or great except vitamin d (25) and testosterone was a bit low. I started testosterone replacement and over the counter Vitamin D3. I was also on pretty powerful steroid drops for two months for a corneal ulcer unrelated to all this. (I guess it was unrelated!) I didn’t know at the time that steroid drops mess with your glucose. For the first week I saw some 130’s, but mostly around 110. After finishing my steroids last week, I have been having normal bg readings. I haven’t changed my diet. I was already doing very low carbs. I increased my activity though. I’m a teacher and I went back to work. I am regularly getting over 20,000 steps a day and I e been jogging a little. I haven’t really lost any weight. I don’t take any medication other than the testosterone and I have only taken one dose of that. I’m no longer convinced I am actually diabetic. Sunday night I experimented and ate 4 slices of a pepperoni pizza. It spiked to 144 but was 72 less than two hours later. I haven’t had carbs like that in months. (And it was glorious.) I think need all new bloodwork and maybe a new doctor. Btw I am a 53 year old male. Should I wait a few weeks and check again? I mean I guess I kinda doesn’t make a difference since I am kinda in the prediabetes range and I will need to improve diet and exercise anyway, but it bugs me.

Discuss this with your doctor. I suggest you request an HbA1c test and possibly an OGTT after waiting long enough for the steroids to have gone from your system.

7. u/RandomThyme [score=9, created=2025-08-28T13:50:55]: No one here can offer any medical information or diagnosis. You will need to speak with your doctor. It would be a good idea to get an A1c done and then go from there depending on the results. Typically a diabetes diagnosis includes an elevated A1c and two elevated fasting glucose test in a row.
