2. u/alan_s [score=0, created=2025-09-02T19:03:17]: Good choice of ingredients but that would be three or four days portions sizes for me.

5. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-08-29T12:07:58]: I love avocados, but either I buy them when they are still hard as rock. Then they sit on the counter, I forget about them then they go bad. Sigh... but otherwise that looks amazing! I usually have an omelet and will mix in finely diced onions and chili. I'll add some chili oil on the side to give it more flavor. Usually 3 Omega3 eggs. A big high on calories, but I get the protein that I usually lack. I fold into it spinach, and mushrooms and sometimes a tomato like you've done. Keeps my blood sugars in check.
