===============================================================================

Before my first pregnancy, my A1c was consistently in the 5.5% range. When I was pregnant with my first, my A1c went up to 6%, I was 236lbs for 5’11” body ( basically obese), and not having the best lifestyle. I was told I needed to go on a high dose of insulin. When asked why the insulin so early in my pregnancy, I was told not to complain since I had been taken insulin prior to that, which I did not. When I tried to tried to explore other alternatives like lifestyle changes, the doctors, insurance refused and connected to a pediatric nutritionist. Let’s just say that and my second pregnancies were a nightmare on so many levels. I did took the recommended insulin but did experience some hypoglycemic episodes. Since 2021, I have not been taking any insulin and been trying to avoid my doctor given the traumatic experiences I had in this area. I happen to take a fasting test and my A1c is 11.1%. I have lost about 7lbs in the past three weeks by reducing my food portions with a healthy mixture of protein, healthy carbs, and eliminating processed food. I have also started to do strength training workouts 3-4 times per week including more walks. My question to the community: is it possible to reduce my A1c by continuing to lose weight and working out? I don’t have a history of diabetics in my family, so I would like to explore various options before committing to insulin once again. TIA!

I was diagnosed 4 months back with A1C of 11.3%. I am a 26F and in within 3 months along with diet, walking and metformin and some other tablets reduced my A1C to 7%. Since I have PCOS and other issues I am taking Mounjaro under my doctor's advise. I have been eating the same as I usually do but I am still consistently loosing weight and my levels are normal. Due to my past habits my body thought the required intake is just 800-1000kcal and rest was over so kept storing almost everything on top in fat. My body was running on survival mode. GLP helps in resetting that. I have taken just 2 shots and I am down about 6-7 pounds already. Meanwhile the workouts and good diet are definitely the key. As per my GP, if I can loose even 15% weight as per my highest weight and maintain it, I will be in remission. Definitely doing the right thing! Insulin is just the momentary fix and not the cure. The lifestyle changes and reducing insulin resistance is the core of remission. You are absolutely right to deny the insulin. Good Luck!

I’ve been a diabetic for about 20 years. When I started I was 236 but only 5’4”. I also was put on insulin. I started researching the effects insulin has on my body, not good. I went to a nutritionist and started to lose the weight. I thought that just by losing weight my sugar would automatically go down. I was wrong, I had to start walking. I think walking is the best way to get your sugar down along with a high protein, high fiber and low carb diet. I walk a lot! In south Florida it rains so I walk around the house. I’ve gotten done great advise from the people in this community. The guy who lost a ton of weight and now walks 4 miles 5 times a week, inspired me to do the same. Doctors are receiving kickbacks for prescribing meds. This country I was born in is no longer concerned with your health just making an another dollar.my cholesterol went down to perfect numbers and the cardiologist gave me a prescription for more. I’m not doing it. Insurance is also pushing drugs. Don’t do it. Be your own advocate. Get serious about your health. If you can find a good Fundamental doctor that would be great. I have the best and I’m so grateful. I wish you the best. Stay strong. Food looks pretty but leaves you with nothing but regrets. 🌸

You will need to do a little more than that regarding your diet. Focus on better blood glucose levels and make weight loss second priority. I explain how to do that here: * [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) * [What is a Balanced Diet For a Type 2 Diabetic?](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/what-is-balanced-diet-for-type-2.html)

Yes, you can do things to lower it and potentially to a healthy range, but adding something like metformin may help you do that faster/more effectively and yes, you can phase metformin out when you don't need it anymore.
5. u/anneg1312 [score=4, created=2025-08-30T05:16:16]: I was diagnosed in Jan 24 with a 10.2 a1c, fatty liver, edema, was the heaviest I’ve ever been. Doc gave me 3 months to see what I could do with keto/diet alone no meds… I just wanted to see what my body could do if I gave it a proper diet and avoid a lifelong regimen of pills if I could. Went ketogenic the next day (30g carbs/day or less). After a month - when all the crazy hunger hormones settled down- I added some light intermittent fasting (2 meals a day and no snacking) then once a week I’d do a longer 20-23 hr one meal a day). I did have test meals once a month ( nothing crazy) to see if I was regaining insulin sensitivity) I was but slowly. In 3 months I was down to a1c of 6.4. By month 10 or 11 it was 5.4. I lost 65 lb while eating plenty of great food. Fatty liver healed up. Lipid panel was normal For the first time in decades. Edema gone. I’ve learned how to make great keto pizza, fries, cupcakes, breads, cookies which keep me happy.
6. u/Destroinretirement [score=3, created=2025-08-30T01:01:08]: Yes. Exercise and weight loss will make a huge difference for the vast majority of cases.
7. u/Afraid-Courage851 [score=2, created=2025-08-29T22:35:38]: My doctor told me to lose 10% of my body weight and I would see a big difference. I’ve lost about 5% and I’m scheduled to get bloodwork in a couple weeks-my 6 months post diagnosis. No matter when I start my fast, my sugar is highest about an hour after I wake up. It’ll drop down to under 100 about 6-7 hours from that initial test. It’s weird. I lost weight by trying to keep my glucose as close to 100 as I can. I don’t eat until it’s under “X” (I don’t want you guys to compare yours to mine you have to set your own goal.) i also follow a Mediterranean diet with some inconsistent intermittent fasting. I have no real answers. If I have a high carb meal like pasta my next one will be little to no carbs. I also try not to drink my carbs.
8. u/catsandplants424 [score=1, created=2025-08-29T22:16:34]: The only carbs you should be eating should be in the form of a vegetable like broccoli. Calories also matter. I take metformin, 500mg morning and night, and basically eat keto style and my A1C went from 11.9 to at last check 5.6.
9. u/jmclaugmi [score=3, created=2025-08-29T20:49:36]: You can take insulin until you loose the weight, get you diet under control, and exercise up... once your a1c is back down wean off the insulin! --- but you need to keep up the effort for life!
10. u/Tardy2DaTardis [score=1, created=2025-08-29T19:46:13]: I would head over to /r/bumperswhobolus and I would say the time for diet and exercise to fix things is gone. Now that you're pregnant that will get harder as you go along and the early stages when the organs are forming are extremely important. I'll let you Google the statistics there plenty of literature about the correlation between a1c and fetal health. Avoiding your doctor isn't going to accomplish much , you need ob care and these days they won't take you at all if you're non compliant. Also towards the end they're going to schedule appointments weekly. Hang in there it's gonna be tough. -a fellow pregnant diabetic who works in healthcare.
11. u/WhitePawedWitch [score=5, created=2025-08-29T19:18:10]: I am not a doctor. However, if you A1C is that high, it is highly likely that you are diabetic. If you have diabetes in pregnancy it is a risk factor for developing type 2. I suggest you read a post called “please take it seriously” in this subreddit. Please find a doctor who is willing to communicate with you and get you care and support that you need. Food and exercise and weight management are the best ways of management of diabetes, but with an A1C of 11, it is likely that you need further support. It is not a failure or a judgement of your character to need medication.
12. u/Subreddit77 [score=1, created=2025-08-29T19:14:53]: Yes, track your carb intake, healthy or not. Download carb manager and use it! Strength training will help as well, but it all comes down to what you eat.
