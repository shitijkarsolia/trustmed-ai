===============================================================================

I was diagnosed Type 2 at age 18, I’m now 30. When I was diagnosed, I was told “you’re diabetic, take these medications” and just left to it. I was diagnosed at my university doctor surgery, and given metformin 500mg (which made me lose 2 stone in two weeks) and then changed to 1000g modified release. I then moved my GP surgery back to my home town, where I was seemed to be forgotten about for years (other than starting me on dapagliflozin 5mg). I was never given any support, guidance or education, just forgotten about and left to it. I’ll admit for a while I was not very good at taking my medication, but a few years back (just qualified now) I started my nursing training, so became more knowledgeable about it through that way. Ive recently finally had a referral to gynaecology for query endometriosis, and was due to have investigatory surgery for this. They did my Hba1c, which came back through the roof at 103mmol (11.6%). I immediately booked a GP appointment, met with a great diabetic nurse, and have a new regime. Went on 160mg Gliclazide am and pm, which was leaving me feeling really sick all the time, and then only recently moved to a long acting insulin. My estimated Hba1c (through the Libre sensor) is now 61mmol (7.7), my blood sugars range from 6 (pre meal) to 16 (post meal with carbs). I just feel really deflated, depressed and stressed all the time. I feel like I’m not doing enough when I’ve cut all the bad things out, swapped from white carbs to brown crabs, no more sugar, swapped for sweetener, but I’m not seeing much change at all. Plus, ive put on weight because of the Gliclazide and insulin.

Become systematic. Use your meter or CGM to discover exactly what the appropriate food choices and portion sizes are for your body. I go into more detail here: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)
2. u/RandomThyme [score=2, created=2025-08-30T06:07:10]: First of all, good job in getting your A1c down to 7.7 from 11.6! That is a significant improvement! It sounds like you are making the right changes and you will most likely see your numbers continue if continue doing what your doing. It can definitely be frustrating when we don't fell like we are improving as fast as we would like. Have you considered speaking with your care team about your concerns? Maybe talking about different medications? Fo you have access to a CGM, even just for a little while as it can be a very valuable tool in figuring out how effect your current treatment regime is and how you as an individual react to different foods. Abbott (Libre) has a program where you request a trial sensor for free, visit their website to see if you qualify.

I only experienced healing and reversal of my T2D lab markers when I went less than 10 carbs per day. Now, I have evolved to a zero-carb high fat diet and have enjoyed a normal A1C for 2.5 years with no medication. I was T2D for 10-years before beginning this journey. I am finishing a 72-hour fast and my blood sugar is currently 58. I just completed a 10-mile bike ride. I could not achieve all this without my low carb lifestyle. I also lost 110-lbs in 8 months, but the weight loss was a nice side effect and not my original goal. Remember, T2D is a disease caused by chronically high insulin levels. Please look into hyperinsulinemia and why injecting more insulin can be like throwing gas on to an already out of control fire.
