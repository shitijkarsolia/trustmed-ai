2. u/ohsothisnowgreat [score=1, created=2025-09-01T18:49:58]: It took me about 2 months to not throw up every time I ate. Hang in there, it gets better! I started on 1000 daily. I am now in 2000 daily and no issues. It’s been a year and a half.

4. u/prettypotterprincess [score=2, created=2025-08-31T06:46:08]: Ask about extended release if it’s too bad. After a few months my body got used to it. Someone told me to take my pill mid meal instead of at the beginning or the end to help with the tummy issues. Idk how much it helps, but that’s how I took it in the early days.

Im struggling with a poor appetite so have to force myself to eat..I've lost weight 70 lbs in total &amp; still have more to lose.

8. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2025-08-30T17:21:36]: When I first started Metformin in 2018 my GP at the time cut the dose so I could adjust for a little before upping it again. I was miserable though. Nothing like being at work and having to excuse myself for having the shits every few minutes. I feel like I lived off Imodium at that time 🤣. It gets better but boy was it rough at first. I would suggest a bidet attachment when you’re at home so you can get a break from wiping and the water will feel so nice, just pat dry and maybe some fiber to try and firm up your stool. Definitely keep hydrated too.
9. u/auroralime [score=2, created=2025-08-30T17:12:30]: yep, that's metformin for you. You may eventually get used to it and have more regular BMs, but many people have said they found the extended release versions of metformin (called metformin ER) to be easier on their stomachs. Play around with food and see what helps your stomach stay settled and make sure you're keeping hydrated if you're frequently having the shits.
