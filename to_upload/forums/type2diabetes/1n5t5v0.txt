===============================================================================

I am having a hard time trying to understand my diabetes and what works well with my body/what doesn’t. I am currently experimenting on how many carbs my body can tolerate. I love keto but it’s too hard for me to maintain. So I am working on doing “low carb” but not keto low carb. More like 30-35 g or less per meal and 15 carbs per snack. So far it has been working well. My body can tolerate brown rice, whole wheat tortillas, corn tortillas, and even whole wheat pasta. As long as I’m pairing it with healthy fats and protein. It’s nice to know I have those options. I even make healthy protein desserts. This has helped me with my binge eating too since I have more options than I did with keto. My A1c was 11.4 right now it is 6.6. It’s hard to make healthy choices as I have been obese my whole life abd struggle with food addiction but I am working on making the small changes and finding healthy alternatives for the foods I love. I still have a long journey but I’ll get there. Low glycemic index has helped me too, as I really love fruit! This post was mainly a vent/wanting to talk type of thing.

I had leftover mac and cheese with fish yesterday for lunch, and it didn't do anything to my numbers. I'm still scratching my head over that one. The sad thing is, I'd much rather jave a potato than Mac and cheese.
2. u/ohsothisnowgreat [score=2, created=2025-09-03T15:46:23]: I have never been more confused at the carbs per meal! My Dr and diabetes nutritionist told me 60 grams per meal!?? My diabetes is under control (my A1C as of last week is 5.9). Diagnostic January 2024.
3. u/suebee1165 [score=1, created=2025-09-03T06:50:48]: 2 slices of bread is around 30 grams of carbs. 1 slice is 15 grams. Read labels!

So I am working on doing “low carb” but not keto low carb. A good decision. These might help you use your meter or CGM systematically: * [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html) * [When To Test](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/11/when-to-test-one-hour-or-two-hour.html)

So, I'd go full Keto for a couple of days and get my BG leveled out (it fluctuated but wasn't spikey.) Them I'd try a serving a carby food (fries, mashed potatoes, cheesy mashed potatoes, cookies, cake, etc). Then I'd see what that did to my BG and how long it lasted. What I found was that some breads were fine (even white bread) while others were nuclear (bagels, croissants). Potatoes spiked me a little but mashing them and adding cheese made them less spikey. Rice is terrible for me in any form. Weirdly, Peanut M&amp;M's have almost no effect, nor do Oreo's. I tried listening to the recommendations of other people but honestly, I think we're all so different and this stupid disease is so poorly understood, that I think you have to become your own science lab and experiment on yourself and see how you react to things. I've got solid control on my T2 now after 2 years because I'm very careful about what I eat. And not for nothing, as much as I thought I'd do well on Keto, it makes me insane after just a few days. It's probably emotional but I feel like I need carbs. I just had to figure out which ones I can tolerate and try to keep them to an appropriate level. That is my best advice. I trust my Endo. I trust me. Everybody else I listen to, but it's a "Trust but verify" situation...
6. u/FatGuy_InALittleCoat [score=2, created=2025-09-01T15:33:38]: Every person is a little different although I think there are good rules of thumb to follow. My dietician told me 60g or less per meal. My doctor agreed with that after seeing my glucose numbers from my reader post-meal. But understand that what works for you may not work for me and vice versa! I think generally if you can keep it under 50 per meal you’ll be totally fine. But 50g of pasta carbs and 50g of bread carbs react differently for me.
7. u/hu_gnew [score=3, created=2025-09-01T14:56:53]: I'm doing very well (5.8) with about 100 grams a day and limiting each meal to 30 grams or less. My thought on the meal limitation is to reduce post meal spikes and eating more than 30 tends to blow that goal right out of the water. I do veggie starters for almost every meal so that helps mitigate spikes a bit.
8. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=4, created=2025-09-01T12:29:55]: I gave up on carbs/meal and went to carbs/day. Treat them like currency. I give myself 50g/day (100g/ weekend day). If I want a donut at breakfast I eat it, but that means I spent 30g of my budget and have to adjust for the rest of the day. If we’re going to the restaurant that has my favorite dessert, I make sure to budget my carbs to allow for dessert at dinner.
9. u/JohnK68 [score=6, created=2025-09-01T09:53:57]: I agree, stop being so hard on yourself. My mantra has been to just remember “Individual results will very”. There is no “1 fix” for all. I started out in 2017 with an A1C of 10. Yes it’s been a long, slow journey to now with plenty of detours, roadblocks, false starts and some poor choices. That said I found that a 40/30/30 (carb/fat/protein) with max calories of 1350 per day seems to be my sweet spot. My last A1c was 6.3 in July and according to my CGM I’m on track to pull a 5.8. You just need to figure out what works for you. Trust me it may take some time but recognize a little win each day to keep your mood up. You’ve got this.
10. u/maec1123 [score=10, created=2025-09-01T09:39:57]: Please stop beating yourself up. You've made amazing progress so far doing what you're doing. People are going to hate me for saying this but Keto is disordered eating. Completely eliminating food (unless you're allergic or can't tolerate it) is disordered eating. It's not healthy and it's not sustainable. Keep focusing on adding healthier items to your diet, prioritizing high fiber, healthy amounts of protein, healthy amounts of good fats, and a sustainable amount of good, beneficial carbs. You need all of these things in life for your body to know what to do with them. If you can, get a nutritionist (or follow the few that mention all foods being good food), get a cgm to see how your body reacts to certain foods at certain times coupled with certain other foods. It's not a one size fits all. Just be nicer to yourself, eliminate the negative talk, and keep progressing.
