Hi all, I’m hoping to hear from people with type 2 who were put on insulin at diagnosis. Were you able to come off it? If so, how long did you need insulin, and what were your circumstances when you were first diagnosed (A1c, ketones, weight, other meds, etc.)? And how was the decision made to come off insulin with your team? A bit about me: * I’m 34F, very lean and active (BMI \~18), strong family history of type 2. * Diagnosed about 5 weeks ago after routine bloods showed very high HbA1c (13%). * No symptoms at diagnosis. * I also had glucose + ketones in urine and very high blood ketones, so I was hospitalised and started on insulin (but hadn't yet gone into DKA, blood ketone was at 3mmol). * All antibodies for type 1/ LADA came back negative. * Current insulin needs: 5units Lantus at night (this usually keeps me steady at around 7mmol (126 mg/dL) at night and fasting), and I seem to be very insulin resistant with carbs (ratio varies between 1:3, and 1:7 depending on time of day, type of carb, level of activity etc). * I've been put on ER Metformin as of 2 weeks ago. Started with 500mg then increased last week to another at dinner, so at 1000mg. Currently experiencing some side effects (constipation), so waiting until this eases before upping my dose. * I haven't noticed much difference in insulin needs as of yet. Maybe slightly less but I think it's too early to tell and not very significant. Though I was initially on 10 units of Lantus the first week, but this was lowering my a1c too quickly (night time was down to 5mmol with this) so switched to 5 units. * I'm currently eating a low carb, high fiber diet (not keto), approx 10g - 20g of carbs per meal, very minimal snacking. Diet is focused on: chicken, oily fish, lots of non-starchy veg, chia seed, flaxseed, raspberries, other fruits and nuts, minimal dairy. Trying to increase the frequency of activity through the day and from next week will work on trying to increase muscle mass. My Diabetic nurse said she's hopeful that I can one day come off insulin if the Metformin looks like it's making a difference. Looking forward to the prospect of not needing to be on insulin - but worried this is a false hope! Thanks!

3. u/Canadian_Insulin [score=3, created=2025-09-04T19:44:14]: Starting insulin with an A1c of 13% and ketones was the right call, it brings sugars down quickly and safely, while giving your pancreas a break. Some people with type 2 are able to come off insulin once things stabilize, especially if metformin, diet, and activity are working. How long that takes varies, sometimes weeks to months , and it depends on how much natural insulin your pancreas can still make. Since you’re lean and active, your case is a bit unusual, so your team will watch you closely to be sure it’s truly type 2 and not another form. Your nurse is right to be hopeful: coming off insulin is possible, but not guaranteed. For now, think of insulin as a tool to protect you, not a life sentence.

I begged to be given a chance to try ketogenic eating and intermittent fasting. She gave me 3 months to try. At the end of 3 months I was down to 6.4. Now I’m 5.4
5. u/ohsothisnowgreat [score=3, created=2025-09-04T13:18:25]: Diagnosed January 2024 after going into DKA. My A1C was 16.9 and ketones were 4.5. I was in the hospital for 33 days because they found perforated diverticulitis. When I was released I was on 5 units of Lantus a day and Metformin 1000 mg a day. After 10 months, when my A1C was 5.9, my doctor took me off Lantus and uped my Metformin to 2000 a day. So far numbers are good!

7. u/1_BigDuckEnergy [score=2, created=2025-09-04T11:23:10]: Genetics are a bitch I was in a similar situation about 18 years ago..... I was early 40s, thin and average weight. When I was first diagnosed my A1C wasn't as high as yours. Perhaps that is why you went straight to insulin? I asked for some time before starting Metformin. I made similar changes as you and dropped my A1C from 8 to 4.1 on diet alone. So there is a lot of hope! I will not that it is a progressive condition and after 5 years that were just nothing else I could do and went on Metformin. That lasted another 10 years and I recently added Junuiva...another pill. The point is that there is A LOT you can do! 1) Change your diet (good for you) 2) Eat less - I started only eating when I was hungry - not when it was time - and I realized I was eating almost twice as much as I needed 3) Exercise more. This is my next frontier as I sit at a desk 55 hours a week
