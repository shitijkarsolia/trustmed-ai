Anyone else like me? Ozempic is supposed to curb appetite which it does but only for fatty foods. It does nothing for carbs which I think is weird. I exercise a lot which leaves me hangry. Anyone else still pig out even on Ozempic? Maybe I should ask for a higher dose. I’m on 1.5 mg per week.

I’m on a much higher dose now up to 10 per week. The only thing I cannot eat is cheese on spaghetti or in mozzarella sticks or milk I will throw up or any soda even diet soda. Everything else I can keep down. When my dose started going up was the only time I really felt a certain way for the day after. Since I’ve started ozempic what is helped me after a good workout is those Atkins protein drinks from jewel.

In fact it did nothing for me. My doctor gave me phentermine also. It's been about a year and I have lost about 70 pounds. I am off phentermine now and doing great with just the oz.

Though they are non conclusive they can be ground for your doctor to stop ozempic. Do discuss all symptoms known or unknown with your doctor. Ozempic type drug’s are rather new and all side effects and long term effects are still not fully understood.

9. u/alan_s [score=4, created=2025-09-04T15:18:33]: Pigging out on carbs? Use your meter or CGM an hour after eating. The numbers you see are likely to help stop over-eating.
10. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=7, created=2025-09-04T14:58:04]: Ozempic mimics the incretin hormone GLP-1. This hormone is triggered strongly by fat, but also protein and carbs once food passes from the stomach into the intestine. Carbs maybe trigger the GIP hormone more than GLP-1. Ozempic works all the time so it's likely that it works to suppress appetite by 'boosting' the effect of the natural hormones released 30 minutes plus after eating, doubling up on the natural GLP-1 hormone in a sense, after food starts to exit the stomach. That may be how it's most effective at suppressing appetite after meals. If you want to maximize the effect maybe start a meal with an appetizer that has a lot of fat and protein, salami or pepperoni or maybe cheese come to mind, with a pause before the main part of the meal. With those kinds of foods hitting the intestine, exiting the stomach, before you start eating carbs you may find your appetite is suppressed sooner. Or maybe eat very slowly to get the maximum hunger suppression from whatever you're eating.
