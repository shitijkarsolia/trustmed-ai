Something I’ve learned about type 2 diabetes: even small improvements in physical activity can make a difference in insulin sensitivity. Even a short walk after meals can help lower blood sugar. Has anyone else noticed this in their routine?

I make sure I get at least one hill and one flight of stairs in my walk.

Got myself a table tennis table and my 19 year old son and I smack the balls every opportunity! Such a fun way to get exercise and also "train" the brain :) I haven't had my 3 month blood tests yet but very much hoping for a sub 6 reading! I've gone from 89kg to 76.4 (pb this morning) in about 8-9 weeks. That's a key improvement but it's off a diet of less than 10g carbs per meal and those post meal walks/table tennis haha
