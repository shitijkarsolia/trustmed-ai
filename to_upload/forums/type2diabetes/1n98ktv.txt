===============================================================================

I (25F) got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes yesterday. My provider told me over the phone, so she didn’t really go into depth about my diagnoses. She told me since it was caught early on, if I take measures now. It can be reversed. She’s starting me on ozempic and 5 other medications (she didn’t even tell me the names.) I know nothing about diabetes, and Im trying to do more research on it, but it’s so confusing. My hemoglobin A1C level is 6.8 &amp; my LDL cholesterol is 110. My Non HDL cholesterol is 135. Can someone break all of this down for me please? And give me tips on where to start with everything. (Apps, tips, recommendations etc) (Pls don’t judge me)

You can research insulin resistance and how to improve sensitivity. At your age you have hope, but your doctor is following what the pharmaceutical instructions tell her. And do not let them bully you onto statins. Look up side effects.

We should all be aware that doctors get a kick back for what and how much they prescribe to their patients. It will take courage and determination to overcome this disease. But please don’t put it off like I did. My greatest regret in life is that I didn’t listen to my parents to lose weight or I’d get diabetes. I’ve had it know for about 25 years but really started doing something 15 years ago. Walk, walk, and walk some more, 90 minutes after eating, just 10 or 20 minutes will help your sugar not to spike. Eat greens, veggies first before your protein and carb. I actually put fresh frozen kale in my protein shake every morning. If I go out I have greens (which I do not like but eat anyway) before my eggs and one piece of toast. It makes a difference. I was on insulin and worked my butt off to stop it, which I did, got off all my meds. Recently I was put on mounjaro to lower my A1C which it hadn’t done. I used no drugs, they weren’t on the market back then, to lose 80 pounds. And the mounjaro does nothing for me so coming off that. I also, for 3 months only, am trying the metformin ER. This is helping with controlling my sugars. I do take supplements for diabetes: Berberine and Alpha Lipoic Sustain. I have a wonderful D.O. who I go to who figures out what to take. I also have a nephrologist, a regular doctor, who doesn’t like to give out prescriptions unless you have tried all other options. Hope this helps and encourages you to be your own advocate. Best of luck on your journey. JS

I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.

5. u/PacRimRod [score=3, created=2025-09-05T09:15:50]: There are many resources on you YouTube, Dr. Berry, Dr. Berg, Dr. Fung, and many more. You really should meet in person with your provider and go over all those medications. That is a lot. Less than a year ago my AIC was over 10, now it is Under 6. I cut out all added sugars, carbs, started IF, and lost 60 pounds so far. So you can definitely get ahead of this! Definitely talk with your provider about all those medications though. Even with my horrible initial numbers, they only put me on Ozempic 1 x per week injection.
6. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=3, created=2025-09-05T08:50:51]: The one thing that changed all of this for me early on was finding Beat Diabetes on YouTube with Dennis Pollock. You will get some resistance with the term reversed, but don't get hung up on names. All that matters is the numbers and doing the right things to feel better and be healthier. While it may seem confusing now, it was for me, it will get much easier over time. I hit 6.9 for a short time and turned it around in a few months and have been coasting in the low fives for a while now. Everyone is different so if it takes longer do not get discouraged. Good luck!
