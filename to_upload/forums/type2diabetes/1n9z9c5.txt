===============================================================================

Since wearing a CGM I‘ve always apply to my right arm since I never sleep on that side. This CGM I wanted to give my right arm a break by applying this sensor to my left arm and last night for the first time I got two compression lows. My alarms were not going off because I didn’t realize I shut down my Libre app last night before bed. I obviously didn’t check with my BGM just to be sure because I didn’t wake up during the lows. Might need to rethink placement or go back to my right arm.
