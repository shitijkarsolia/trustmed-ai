===============================================================================

So I typically use great value brand non dairy powdered creamer. But I found it is spiking me quite a bit for some reason. Do you guys have any recommendations for sugar free+plain flavored? I am currently trying to the coffee mate zero sugar french vanilla and I just...hate it. I dont like additional flavors in my coffee. But I can't find any that's just regular cream. Ive tried half and half and using less of it but that also spikes me. I hate this. I already have to limit myself to 1 coffee a day and diabetes is taking that from me too 😭

2. u/PacRimRod [score=1, created=2025-09-08T09:55:26]: Half and half does not raise or spike me.
3. u/Spinalstreamer407 [score=2, created=2025-09-07T21:40:33]: Heavy cream.
4. u/LunaSolaria25 [score=1, created=2025-09-07T19:37:06]: I use heavy cream and some protein powder or protein shake that’s very low sugar for some flavor.
5. u/k_princess [score=3, created=2025-09-07T06:23:54]: Either heavy cream or half and half.
6. u/Skyzfallin [score=6, created=2025-09-06T17:11:43]: I use heavy cream
7. u/MOJO-Rizing [score=1, created=2025-09-06T17:05:20]: Half and half is way better
8. u/arguix [score=2, created=2025-09-06T16:09:01]: real cream, has less or close to no sugar compared to milk
9. u/alan_s [score=1, created=2025-09-06T15:38:52]: Instead of the chemical soup of creamers I use real cream or reduced real cream. Don't they sell real cream in the USA? All the flavour and almost zero carbs.
10. u/cat-handcuffs [score=2, created=2025-09-06T14:46:54]: I buy heavy whipping cream at Aldi. Reasonably priced for a large container.
11. u/Gullible_Square_852 [score=4, created=2025-09-06T14:00:12]: The Coffe Mate sugar free Italian sweet cream is the closest to cream and sugar that I've found. No maltodextrin.
12. u/kitamake [score=2, created=2025-09-06T13:43:24]: It’s possible it’s not the creamer and the coffee itself is spiking you. Have you tried decaf coffee to compare?
13. u/RetiredToExplore [score=1, created=2025-09-06T13:36:24]: Half and half shouldn't spike your sugar much at all. Maybe try it again? Coulda been a fluke. Do people still use that word?
14. u/FishermanUsed2842 [score=2, created=2025-09-06T11:08:54]: Have you tried NutPods? They're zero sugar and non-dairy.
15. u/WhitePawedWitch [score=1, created=2025-09-06T11:06:58]: So I’d recommend half and half or heavy cream if you’re looking for creamy but not sweet.
16. u/Equivalent-Yoghurt38 [score=2, created=2025-09-06T10:28:29]: I use the regular Chobani sweet cream. Since I only use about a teaspoon it doesn’t seem to spike me. However, I can’t drink it first thing in the morning anymore. I have to wait till about an hour after I eat my breakfast or the caffeine seems to cause me to spike really high, even if I drink it black.
17. u/Snoozinsioux [score=1, created=2025-09-06T10:25:39]: Heavy cream, olive oil or butter are all great additions to coffee. You can put a few drops of vanilla if you need another flavor.
18. u/Occasionally_Sober1 [score=1, created=2025-09-06T10:18:44]: I use almond milk.
19. u/ReddHottSc [score=2, created=2025-09-06T09:50:26]: I just bought the Coffee-Mate Zero Coconut cream and it is fantastic. I hate anything that tastes like artificial sweetener.
20. u/tbrando1994 [score=1, created=2025-09-06T09:37:49]: https://a.co/d/a4W54SY This only has stevia in it—-none of that artificial sweetener shit that will spike you. Stevia is not an artificial sweetener. It will not spike you. That, and monkfruit and allulose. I tend to like stevia. Careful with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) stuff in it too even when it says it’s sugar free as that is the devil in disguise. HFCS is linked with fatty liver disease and all sorts of metabolic shit. Google in pubmed, NIH, ect…it’s beyond ultra processed and should not be in anything. Since it came in our food industry in the 70’s it has wrecked havoc on us all. It’s hard to make sure it’s not in something you are ingesting.
21. u/mYstiSagE [score=2, created=2025-09-06T09:29:45]: I do like flavored coffee sometimes, so I bought some of Torani's sugar free and they're pretty nice, but my favorite thing to add to my iced coffee is just half and half. Let's me enjoy the coffee with some added creaminess. Bliss is a good brand for coffee as well.
22. u/Imfr0ggy [score=3, created=2025-09-06T09:22:51]: So I just wanted to update everyone. Even after switching to a sugar free alternative I'm still spiking! After some research I learned that powdered artificial sweetener sometimes has maltodextrin in it, which I guess has a high glycemic index and can spike blood sugar in those with diabetes 😐 so it wasn't the creamer, it was the Splenda!! I plan on buying liquid Stevia instead. Thank you for all the recommendations though. I think I'm still gonna switch to heavy whipping cream as it has less carbs than my preferred creamer and overall sounds like it'll taste better.
23. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2025-09-06T09:00:59]: I’ve found that sugar free flavors make my sugar drop low so I just bite the bullet and use regular creamer and just be easy with it
24. u/TrixieKixx [score=5, created=2025-09-06T08:45:12]: I use heavy whipping cream. It has 3 carbs per half cup. I only use 1 Tbsp in each of my two cups of coffee, so it’s negligible. It doesn’t spike me at all, but YMMV.
25. u/rckblykitn14 [score=3, created=2025-09-06T08:19:39]: I just got a sugar free pumpkin spice one. Actually having an iced coffee with it right now. It's quite good! International Delight brand. My usual is the Silk brand oat creamer, sugar free cinnamon vanilla. That stuff is freaking amazing. Starbucks also has two I really like - caramel macchiato and mocha. Both sugar free, both fantastic. If you're not a flavored creamer person, half and half or heavy cream works.
26. u/fanatiqual [score=4, created=2025-09-06T07:59:52]: Heavy cream has virtually no carbs when you consider the amount you'll use for a cup of coffee. I use it and it doesn't cause a spike at all. Just a splash though, maybe 2 tablespoons full is enough since it's so creamy.
