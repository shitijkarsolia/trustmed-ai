===============================================================================

Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with T2D on July 21st of this year. I was given Metformin, which did not agree with my body so I have been managing my blood sugars ok. My PCP gave me Mounjaro 2.5 to start with….well I’ve been putting it off for almost 3 weeks now. I don’t know why I’m so nervous. I think it’s because I’m afraid of having hypoglycemia. I am on no other meds, no insulin, nothing! Can anyone share their success stories? I’m really wanting to take it tonight. Any advice is very much appreciated

It was an amazing moment when I started for as long as I can remember I never felt full when I ate until the food was gone. The food noise telling me where the food was or what was in the house to eat absolutely stopped. I am no longer focused on and what’s for dinner. My A1C dropped from 14.8 to 10.7 in the first month on 2.5mg.

Most people who do have those issues when taking MJ are also taking other diabetes meds. I have been T2D for over 30 years and have been taking MJ for a little over 2 years. My HbA1c just before I started taking it was 8.6 and three months later, it was 6.1. More recently, it has been 5.1/5.2. GLP1 meds do often cause some GI issues, but I have found them manageable. I think Mounjaro is a great drug for diabetics. Good luck!
4. u/Stellar_Crafter [score=2, created=2025-09-06T16:40:03]: I was diagnosed back in March and started Mounjaro in April. We skipped Metformin cause I was actually trying to start on it’s sister drug Zepbound to loose weight. I went from a 7.7 to 6.2 a1c in 3 months. I get more bloodwork done at the end of the month. My glucose levels have been much better. I’ve lost 60lbs. My pain levels are significantly lower. My spouse says my snoring is almost nonexistent. And I have better control of impulse decisions (not randomly spending money or buying random sweet snacks). Yes I have had side effects that I am learning my triggers and how to manage them. Everyone is different when it comes to Mounjaro. I have only had 2 times when my glucose has dropped to almost below 70. Both times I hadn’t eaten much of anything. One was I had a protein shake and that was it. The other I had breakfast and a protein shake before work, then didn’t eat at work. I find I do best with small meals more often. I keep easy to grab snacks at home like yogurt, cheeses, fresh fruit and veggies. You got this. Be open and honest with yourself and your doctor about your symptoms and side effects. Yall can work together to make the best of it. Keep a good journal so you know you are eating enough.

I have been on mounjaro for almost 18mos now and it has been great. My side effects have been manageable but I have been proactive with them. My A1c is the best it has ever been in my life and my blood sugar well regulated and monitored through use of a cgm. Personally, i wish I had known how trash I would feel as my body got adjusted to “normal” ranges but it was also something manageable and I tried to stay on top of with discussion with my provider
