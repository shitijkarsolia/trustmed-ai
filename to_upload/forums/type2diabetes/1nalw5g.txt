===============================================================================

I am a 24 year old female with type 2 diabetes. I was diagnosed 2 and 1/2 months ago. My periods were like clockwork, never missed them before diagnosis but now there is no sign of it. Is it because of my diabetes or something else? I am on 1000mg metformin per day (500mg morning and 500mg at night). I used to be like a panda sleeping all day and now because of my diagnosis i started walking everyday for 30 min at minimum and started a low carb diet (before i used to eat sugar and carbs like crazy). Maybe it’s cause of my sudden changes in diet and exercise? Idk i don’t wanna stress about it bcoz stress is one of the main reasons i got diabetes in the first place😭 To give more clarity- my bg dropped from 215 to 125 within 2 months with proper treatment. I also thought maybe it is bcoz of these rapid fluctuations. I get soooo stressed when i miss a period, usually it comes within 1 week or something but it’s not this time and don’t assume that i could be preg bcoz i am not sexually active. I also had normal pms symptoms like tender breast or mild cramping like i used to before diagnosis.

I'm not on meds though, just Keto diet. I go for a yearly checkup (not my type 2 diabetic appointment) in November, will be running this by my primary doctor again. The only thing I changed was carb and sugar intake.
