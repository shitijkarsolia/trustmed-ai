My husband has Type 2. He eats anything he wants. No special diet. He’s on Metformin. He’s 77 and gets bloodwork every 6 months. So far all the Dr has done is increase the metformin dose. Is every 6 months the norm for monitoring A1c? Thank u.

2. u/RetiredToExplore [score=1, created=2025-09-09T19:49:10]: Controlling diabetes is different for every one. Some people like the control of checking sugars all the time and every 3 month a1c's. Others need a more laid back approach. Diabetes starting at 77 doesn't need as aggressive management as someone at 50 who may have to live with it for 30 or 40 years. If his aic is below 8, that may be good enough. Every six months is fine in any case for a1c. Ideally, you would like to find a nutritionist that understands someone of his generation and can suggest straightforward minor changes that will help him gradually improve. Hope this gives you a little less angst.

However I am VERY careful about sugar obviously and eat pretty well/healthy. Do I cheat every now and then yes I do. When I was first diagnosed I was Obese! And that definitely turned my life around. I remember as I was changing my diet getting my fat ass to the gym it was the Super Bowl and I was saying to my doctor it’s going to suck because I can’t eat any wings and I love wings. Her response “You can have a few of them but you need to make sure you do physical activity that day before you do. It’s a reward and you’re allowed a reward. The other thing she told me is I could eat what I wanted within reason but I MUST do physical activity every day. Now fast forward I dropped 37lbs and I’m still on 2000mg of Metformin because I can’t get my A1C under control. Now mind you I’m 54 I wasn’t getting enough sleep and probably drink a tad too much. But it has gone down and I think when my next blood test which I think is in about 2 months it should go down even further. But all my other numbers were good! BP, BS, Cholesterol (could be a little lower) and I feel great! But I’m monitored by my doctor every few months and I’m on the right path. This works for me and not for everyone. But the key for us is to make sure we are physical and we need to “watch” what we are eating g and eat right. Does that mean the 1 McDonald’s Burger and Fries I had Friday Night is going to kill Me. No! Was I physical Friday and Saturday YES. But the results will be in a couple of months. Also she did tell me that sleep has a lot to do with getting BS and A1C down as well.

5. u/alan_s [score=2, created=2025-09-08T17:13:34]: Six months for A1c is not unusual but no special diet is not the norm. However, it is difficult to comment further without knowing whether his A1c is good, maybe that regimen works for him. Does he test with a home blood glucose meter? PS I saw your other reply stating A1c is 8.7%. That is definitely not good. Please ask him to read some suggestions I wrote to help him: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html) If he reckons he's too old to worry about it at 77 mention that I'm 78.
6. u/EggieRowe [score=0, created=2025-09-08T13:08:14]: The shortest testing interval is about 3 months - the lifespan of the red blood cells A1c is derived from. My SO won't check his BG at home and eats marginally better than he did before being diagnosed. Metformin, regular and ER, didn't agree with him so his GP eventually put him on Ozempic. I hated the idea of him being on a GLP-1, but it's been for the best. His A1c stays around 6 now and he lost his taste for alcohol. My only complaint is when he eats now he fills up really fast and doesn't prioritize protein.
7. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=5, created=2025-09-07T21:21:29]: If he's only getting tested every 6 months then he must be doing well on the Metformin. My mother was about that age when she got diabetes. I let her eat whatever she wanted. Who knows how much longer she was going to live and she loved food. If he understands the risks of the long term effects of fluctuating blood sugars and still chooses to eat whatever he wants, that's up to him.
8. u/hexen84 [score=3, created=2025-09-07T21:14:10]: Every 6 months is the normal time frame for testing a1c. He should probably be testing his blood sugar daily / multiple times a day with a lancet and glucose meter.
