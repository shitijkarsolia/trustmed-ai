Apple bought out a company that was working on such a device, I expect to see it in an Apple watch in a few years time. They *may* license it to others (though, I doubt it). But the technology is getting there for this to happen soon. University of Waterloo in Canada is working on a device: [https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/no-more-needles-tracking-blood-sugar-your-wrist](https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/no-more-needles-tracking-blood-sugar-your-wrist) And another article: [https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/06/16/apple-watch-13-may-gain-blood-sugar-monitoring-in-2027](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/06/16/apple-watch-13-may-gain-blood-sugar-monitoring-in-2027) I'm super excited for this! I wear a Galaxy Watch right now and would instantly buy an Apple Watch just for this. As it is I'm spending roughly $200/mo on my Libre 2 and even at $1,000 for a high-end Apple Watch I'd still be saving (provided it gave me correct results).
