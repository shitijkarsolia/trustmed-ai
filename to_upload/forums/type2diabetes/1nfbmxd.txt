Hi everyone, here is my story. Back in 2019, I went to see my doctor because I wanted to quit smoking. He sent me for a blood test, and that’s when I found out my A1C was 10. Suddenly, I had a bigger problem than smoking. Yes, smoking is bad, but this was worse. My doctor prescribed Metformin 500 mg: one pill in the morning and one after dinner to get me started and see how things would progress. I used to be really active, playing sports regularly. But I had stopped almost everything without changing my lifestyle. I was still drinking sugary drinks, energy drinks, eating sweet snacks, and barely moving. No exercise, no balance. On top of that, I have a family history of Type 2 diabetes on my mother’s side. After three months of making changes, my A1C dropped to 7. Now, it’s around 6 and still taking Metformin 500mg. Here are a few examples of what I did and still do: • I drink water instead of sugary drinks or energy drinks. • I eat raspberries or blueberries instead of sweet treats. • I walk every day, about 60 to 90 minutes. • I get 7 hours of sleep each night. Diabetes doesn’t go away, but it can be managed. That’s something I’ve learned firsthand. Since joining Reddit, I’ve seen how many people are actively taking control of their health. It’s inspiring to see the different paths people take to live well with this condition. Thanks for reading. If anyone has tips or wants to share their own journey, I’d love to hear it.
