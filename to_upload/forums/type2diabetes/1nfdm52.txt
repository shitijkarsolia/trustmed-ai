Your post reminded me of when I first joined this sub - I had just been diagnosed with a blood glucose of 560 and a bp of 240/140 (or somewhere in that neighborhood) on 18 May 2025. I was scared to even go to sleep because when I was discharged from ER, they were saying things like, "how are you not in a coma??" and "how are you not having a stroke??" and they couldn't get my bp below 190/120 or so. When I came here seeking answers, people were talking about meds I'd never heard of and A1C, which I knew nothing about. But! Everyone was very kind and I did find one person whose starting blood glucose level had been higher than mine, which made me feel better. Fast forward: I met with a follow up doctor who explained everything to me, set me up with a food plan, a bp monitor, a blood glucose monitoring kit, a slew of meds, then ran a bunch of tests (including my first A1C) before sending me on my way. I was still scared but at least I felt a little empowered. I've been tested monthly since then and my fasting blood sugar is currently 82 (in the normal range!!), my A1C, which started at 13.6, is now down to 6.7, and my blood pressure is 118/74!! The only thing that's still a struggle and will be for another 6 to 12 months is the nerve damage to my left leg. It's healing but it's a long, zappy journey that's sometimes pretty painful. You've found a good place with people who truly know what you're going through. Oh, one more thing to know: everybody's journey looks a little different. As you learn more, you'll figure out how to tweak things for your needs.

I am currently trying this myself using a low carb calorie deficit diet (low carb keeps blood sugar levels stable while I work towards remission). You can find info about this in Roy Taylor's book (living without diabetes) or on the website below. https://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal/

Go for a walk, if you don’t normally walk, start walking and build up your stamina until you can walk for at least 45min to an hour. I started walking last year after I ate and I still walk everyday. It helps control my blood sugar levels and has helped decrease my weight. In the last year I’ve lost 73lbs from walking and my A1C went from 9.5 to 5.4. I also take my meds which have been reduced a lot over the course of the year as well.

My advice to start drink plenty of water excersize daily as much as your able, don’t eat potatoes, pasta, rice,bread, processed food are your enemy. Eat small portions, vegetables,berries, nuts in moderation, boiled eggs,lean red meat, chicken, fish fresh and tinned, keep positive. A lot of people say don’t take any advice from people on You Tube but as others have mentioned there are lots of good information I follow Dennis Pollock (Beat Diabetes) go take a look his information will put you on the right track. If you have any other questions feel free to ask I hope this helps in some way.
7. u/ArkieRN [score=4, created=2025-09-12T21:24:48]: I want to caution you about metformin. It’s a great drug for diabetes and has been safely used for decades. It’s also very inexpensive. But…when you start using metformin it can cause gastrointestinal problems. So take it with food and be prepared to still have nausea (possibly vomiting) and diarrhea. It may persist for a few weeks but it WILL go away. Don’t give up and quit taking it. Don’t skip doses. If you find yourself having lots of nausea, buy some alcohol prep pads (the ones nurses wipe your skin with before giving a shot). Open the pad and smell when the nausea hits. It’s clinically proven more effective than many anti nausea meds. OTC meds like Imodium work well for diarrhea.
8. u/[deleted] [score=6, created=2025-09-12T20:28:33]: There’s some really great advice on here. The best thing since I was diagnosed almost 5 years ago was diet, exercise and watch what you eat. And make sure you take your Metformin with food.

If you are extremely motivated you could go hard core keto for a few months, but it hard to maintain long term.
12. u/anonymiam [score=4, created=2025-09-12T16:35:28]: There are various approaches to getting your health back on track. I was not treating my body very well and had some god awful numbers at diagnosis. They scared me... so as extreme as I was being in the negative I went extreme in the positive. My numbers... 3 months ago: weight 89kg. Now: 75kg. My fasting BG: 14.4, now: 5.2. My a1c: 10.2, now: not tested yet - better be low 6s! My approach: try and walk or exercise after every single meal. Limit each of 3 meals to less than 15g carbs. I tend to be around 10 per meal. Snack are less than 5g maybe once a day. Didn't do anything except the low carb diet and exercise to lose the weight and it fell off! First 10kg lost in the first 6 weeks. Go to foods: berries and yopro vanilla yoghurt (it's no sugar but tastier than Greek!) for breakfast. (First couple of weeks it was eggs and bacon but now I can't stomach them!). Lunch: Caesar salad with chicken and no croutons. Chicken and salad wraps. Dinner: vege stir fries with chicken (Asian style) or ham, pepperoni, mushroom pizza. Wraps and pizzas use a low carb wrap which is 4.3G per wrap. For the pizza you toast that wrap on a fry pan to get crispy first and then create the pizza and shove in oven. Friggin too good! Edit: oh I have steaks and vege with mushroom sauce too! I also take 1g of metformin morning and night. Honestly I feel healthier than I have ever (I'm 49 btw). And confident im adding years to what would have been my life. Hoping to introduce some more carbs under testing conditions when my a1c is confirmed down in a month or so from now.
13. u/monetaryg [score=6, created=2025-09-12T16:33:12]: Your A1C of 6.5 was just at the cutoff, so it was caught early. Like others have said, you should test your blood sugar after meals to get a feel for what affects you. Foods affect everyone differently. You will need some carbohydrates, mainly in the form of fiber. You want to stay away from refined carbs(bread, cake) and starchy vegetables. This is where the testing comes in. It’s almost like an allergy elimination diet. Eliminate as much as you can initially and add things back, and test. You might find that you can eat some potatoes with a meal, or maybe not. You might find that sourdough bread is ok for you, maybe not. It’s overwhelming at first, but you will get the hang of it. Also exercise like others have said. Your skeletal muscles can uptake glucose without needing insulin to open the door. Walking after meals helps to flatten or eliminate a spike. Just be aware that exercise can also cause a rise in blood sugar, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while. I wear a stelo CGM, which is available OTC in the US. It’s $90 for a month supply(2 sensors). I initially was only going to wear one for a month or 2, but I like the data it provides so will wear one indefinitely. With such a low A1C, im not surprised you weren’t given any instructions or testing supplies. The metformin alone may get your A1C down, but testing gives you real time info.

15. u/Mtnmaggots [score=6, created=2025-09-12T15:11:19]: People on this site are AWESOME! I (56)M 5’7” 167 lbs. was diagnosed three months ago with an A1C of 14.6. Scared shitless. My recent A1C was 6.1 and I weigh 155. My height hasn’t changed though, damn it. Anyway, I have learned so much from Redditors. Let’s face it, the majority of people are given the diagnosis with not a lot of info right away and leave with a prescription of Metformin. It’s an extremely overwhelming moment but within a short time you might see this as an opportunity to make the positive changes your body needs for a healthy life. As the first responder said WALK, WALK and then WALK some more. It is mind blowing how fast you can lower your blood sugar just doing that after a meal. Listen and learn from these people!
16. u/Soft_Ad1968 [score=12, created=2025-09-12T14:43:03]: Hey. It’s ok to be scared. I was when I found out about 5 months ago. I felt a ton of guilt about doing this to myself. But after a couple days I made to decision to change my life. I am 44 m 6’5” and I was 325 lbs and my A1c was 10.1 at diagnosis. I am now 275 lbs and my a1c is now 6.6 after first 3 months with just 500mg of metformin. Here is my path to success 1) don’t try to quit everything at once. If you try to quit everything at once it will be more difficult. The first thing I did was quit drinking pop and sugary drinks. 2) start watching your carb intake. I have a protein shake for breakfast and a keto wrap with ham, turkey, cheese and lettuce with string cheese for lunch everyday. Total of about 20 carbs. I try to limit my dinner carbs to 30 to 40. Make sure to eat a lot of protein and fiber with dinner. It will help with the sugar spike. 3) most important for me, WALK, WALK, WALK!! I go on a two mile walk after lunch and dinner everyday I can. At bare minimum go for a brisk 15 minute walk after meals. I have had some bigger carbs meals and my blood sugar spikes very little because of my walking. 4) you can still enjoy your life. Have a treat every once in a while. Just make sure to walk after!! Remember that people with well managed diabetes live longer than people without diabetes. That alone gave me a ton of hope. People on here as super helpful with stories and advice. It has helped me a ton As long as you are ready to change, you will. You got this. And remember to walk!!

To stay organized, I initially created a reference page to gather everything I’d learned. That page eventually grew into a full website where I now share my findings with others who might benefit. All sources and references are included for transparency. While I can't post the link here, you can find it by checking the Social Link tab on my profile.
