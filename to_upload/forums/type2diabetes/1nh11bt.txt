Hello! Since my diagnosis, I have been extremely careful about food choices and serving size. My most frequent Google search is “Can diabetics eat _____?” Often the answer is “yes, but in moderation.” If I’m not exceeding the recommended single serving size, I’m curious what “in moderation“ means in terms of frequency? Once a day? Once a week? Once a month? Take brown rice, for example. If I’m meal prepping, can I have a single serving of brown rice with vegetables and protein for three days in a row, or is that exceeding “in moderation?” Thanks in advance for any input!

For protein and fats "in moderation" means apply common sense and satiety. These are the post-meal goals I set for myself: [Blood Glucose Targets](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/blood-glucose-targets-2015.html) And this is how I achieve them: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

A bit of cake instead of a piece, 4 m&amp;m’s not a handful… BUT every one of us is different so it’s best to eat to your meter. Invest in a cgm for a month or two… note what spike YOU.
3. u/JEngErik [score=3, created=2025-09-14T15:41:42]: For me, and I'm not speaking for anyone else who is able to apply this term successfully, I believe it's meaningless. I don't use "moderation" in any way when making choices about food. I was speaking to my nephew who studies linguistics. He kind of went off the rails looking into it and this was what he came up with. Back in the 19th century people were already using the word moderation, but it came from old philosophy and moral advice. Doctors and reformers would tell people to be moderate with things like sugar, alcohol, or rich foods. The diet back then was closer to whole foods. Industrial sugar and refined flour were just starting to take hold, but nothing like the food environment we have now. In the early 20th century industrial food took off. You started seeing canned goods, factory bread, and cheap vegetable oils. Nutrition science was young, so most advice stayed vague. Moderation became the stand in for "just do not overeat." After World War II food manufacturing blew up in scale. Convenience foods, sodas, processed cereals became the base of the Western diet. Instead of saying "stop eating this stuff," both government dietary guidelines and food companies leaned into the same soft idea: enjoy it in moderation. By the 70s and 80s the word moderation was everywhere. You can see it in USDA guidelines, in food industry marketing, in ads for soda or snacks. The brilliance of it is that it prevents any one food from being labeled bad. Coke, chips, burgers, candy all fit the script as long as you said moderation. It takes the spotlight off the way the food itself is made and puts the blame on you if your health suffers. You are the one who failed at being moderate. Sorry to wax philosophical. Again, this works for some, but it didn't work for me.

Legumes like chick peas and refried beans raise blood sugars and insulin MUCH LESS . Glycemic index is the number that helps you pick out carbs that are healthier, vs over processed junk. Genic index: 40-50 good, 50-60. So-so. Over 60, minimize as much as possible. So to answer your question, brown rice 3 days in a row: all good. Same number of carbs as white bread or potato chips, big problem.
5. u/Digisticks [score=3, created=2025-09-14T14:00:09]: Like others have said, I try and keep myself to X amount of carbs per day. 50 is my usual goal, but if I have a day with 75, it's okay. My biggest issue was portion control. I could eat an entire family sized bag if Doritos every 2 days. Easy. Would pig out on ice cream or pizza. While I've really changed my diet drastically, I will let myself get a snack pack of chips. Maybe once or twice per week, I'll have a bag if I met my protein goal for the day, and didn't eclipse 50 carbs. That's what I define as moderation. Smaller portion sizes of things I enjoyed. When I'm at a special event, holiday party, or conference, I'll relax my diet just a little. Maybe have a roll or something I wouldn't normally do. But it's about getting back on the train after that's over.
6. u/zoebud2011 [score=2, created=2025-09-14T13:47:32]: I'm kind of of the mind that carbs = currency too. I'm honest about portion sizes, and I log everything I eat. I've been strict about carbs, but now that I've been at this a while and have everything under control, I find I can eat things every day that I couldn't before. I can eat 3 ounces of strawberries with a high protein breakfast every morning. I can have a daily bite of something naughty as long as it fits into my carb allowance, and I don't eat it by itself, but with a meal. It's keeping the food noise at bay, and my numbers haven't changed.
7. u/mrnoonan81 [score=6, created=2025-09-14T13:39:30]: I think in terms of carbs per hour, however not carbs consumed, but rather carbs absorbed. Some carbs are very fast and some are slow. The glycemic index of a food can give you some idea of that. It may be beneficial to look up the different types of resistant starches as well. You can eat many more slow carbs in a meal without significantly increasing your blood sugar than fast carbs. What's key is that you can make them slower by combining them with protien, fat, and fiber. Can you eat a cookie? Probably not a good idea on an empty stomach. That would be a lot of carbs very fast and overwhelm your body. After a salad and steak? That would be very different. They would trickle in over a longer period. How many over what period of time would depend on your insulin sensitivity and production. The secondary question is how often can you allow yourself to be hyperglycemic? I don't think there's an accepted answer for that. I think it's a little like asking how many cigarettes you can smoke.
8. u/FarPomegranate7437 [score=2, created=2025-09-14T13:32:33]: What you should be doing is testing yourself after your meals, especially when you’re eating something new or changing the portion sizes or combinations of foods. There isn’t an absolute of how much of X you can have, because it does vary for each person, what else was eaten in the meal, and even your physical condition on the day. For me, I find that a full portion size of brown rice is too much and causes me to spike, even when eaten with sufficient fat, protein, and fiber. Depending on what else I’m eating, I might have half a portion now, but I was able to handle even less at diagnosis. Same thing goes for things like steel cut oats or pasta. If you’re testing, try testing 60 minutes and then 120 minutes after the first bite. People typically spike around an hour after their first bite (note that this varies from person to person), so testing roughly an hour after you start your meal can give you a general idea of how much a food can affect you. You should be closer to your pre meal fasting at the 2 hour mark. If you’re still noticeably higher than your pre meal fasting, you might want to change something about your meal.
9. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=7, created=2025-09-14T13:09:53]: Treat carbs like currency. You have $xxx grams of carbs to ‘spend’ every day. Mine is 50g on weekdays and 100g on weekend days. So if I want a donut for breakfast, I just spent 30g and have to budget for the rest of the day. If I want dessert at dinner I have to limit carbs during the day so I can have apple crisp for dessert. Carbs = currency makes your life easy.
10. u/Ethan-Wakefield [score=4, created=2025-09-14T13:02:28]: I think it’s easier to count grams of carbs and look at that like a daily allotment. You can get more complicated and think in terms of glycemic index and do monitoring etc, but the simplest, most basic place to start for me was just counting my carbs and trying to stay inside of a daily goal. Personally, that was the single biggest thing that reduced my A1C numbers.
