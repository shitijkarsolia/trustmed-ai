Your probably under the threshold still, but who knows. You need to immediately lower carbohydrate intake, lose weight, and gain muscle. Monitor with a finger prick moving forward. There's a chance you are still insulin sensitive, and you can further increase insulin sensitivity with major lifestyle changes.

You likely are in the diabetic range if not full on diabetic. Again, confirm with your doctor. In the meanwhile, learn about carbs and how they affect your blood sugar levels. Cut your carb intake and definitely stop drinking regular soda. Switch to zero sugar or diet variations if you must. Getting control of your diabetes or preventing it if you don't have it, will boil down to your diet. And I don't mean a fad diet. I mean changing your lifestyle and the way you approach food and types of food.

Start simple by switching to diet cokes instead and cutting down on foods like fries. If that's too hard, you can literally just start smaller by cutting your portion sizes and adding something healthy to your meal. For example instead of a large portion of fries, opt for a small portion and add something healthy and full of fiber like a variety of veggies. You'll still get some of what you craved but you're gonna feel more full that way and you'll be less likely to spike.

7. u/tfunk024 [score=3, created=2025-09-16T06:27:38]: Keep in mind you need to see a real Doctor and confirm with blood tests. BUT, and I’m sorry to say this it sound like you’re full on type 2. Fasting blood sugar over 100 is a dead giveaway. You could be very late stage prediabetic. B/c no way in hell most of us could have fries and 2 cokes without some form of meds but I unfortunately wouldn’t hold your breath [one of us](https://media1.tenor.com/m/mpmbsd82G14AAAAC/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort.gif)
8. u/hexen84 [score=2, created=2025-09-16T06:25:03]: You should probably look into getting your a1c checked. 130 may be high (prediabetes level) or it may be a fluke. Without an a1c it's mostly going to be a guessing game. Catching it early means you should be able to prevent many of the bad parts of the disease if you end up having it.
