===============================================================================

Woke up around 7am and got my day started. My team is mostly in India, so their day is almost over when mine starts. Sat down to read emails before making some breakfast and there’s a truly upsetting email in the mix. Jumped up to over 180. Now even after going for a walk it isn’t coming down much. I haven’t even had a chance to eat yet and I’m already super high.

2. u/WifeyMcGingerdork [score=4, created=2025-09-17T17:35:02]: I have the same problem. Every little thing seems to send my blood sugar spiking. Stress = spike. Too hot = spike. Too cold = spike. Injury = spike. Allergy attack = spike. Dehydrated = spike. Overly tired = spike. Someone farts too close to me = spike ... You get the picture ...
3. u/monetaryg [score=3, created=2025-09-16T16:49:00]: Same here. It’s very frustrating. I work in IT and a stressful network migration or outage can spike me to 180-200 easily. At least it doesn’t affect my blood pressure.

5. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=2, created=2025-09-16T06:38:48]: Stress for me too can spike me more than some of the foods I eat. I recently took up golfing and not wanting to look like a total ass out on the course, my stress level is through the roof. I've started turning my app off during most of my play until I settle down playing.
