===============================================================================

I have prediabetes, my doctor has me on a a multi medication plan, they prescribed metformin and glypizide. I'm supposed take both of them twice a day. I've been using both for almost 2 years I don't like the metformin's side affects, so I want to switch to a different medicine. It sometimes gives me diarrhea, with varying intensity. Sometimes I just need a quick trip to the bathroom and I will be fine for the rest of the day, other times I have multiple bouts across several hours, I would be so exhausted that I have to stay in bed between trips. There's also the dehydration, I have trouble keeping hydrated due the frequent bathroom visits .

2. u/Biggins58 [score=1, created=2025-09-18T13:44:59]: I had issues with Metformin, discussed it with my Dr and they switched me to Jardiance to go with the Januvia that I was also taking. No issues at all since the switch.
3. u/InternationalDuck190 [score=2, created=2025-09-17T18:21:48]: When I was first diagnosed they put me on metformin and it made me so sick I almost ended up in the hospital with dehydration. The docs now have me on Jardiance and I have had no problems. But I can honestly say I was pretty scared to try anything after the metformin issues.

5. u/TheRavenWritingDesk [score=2, created=2025-09-17T12:09:34]: Talk to your doctor. I did, and they prescribed the extended release version which relieved my symptoms.
6. u/jailtheorange1 [score=2, created=2025-09-17T05:34:29]: It really is a miracle drug, but if I were on an extended day out away from toilets, I wouldn’t take it that day.
7. u/anneg1312 [score=2, created=2025-09-17T04:06:03]: Have you considered going ketogenic for 3-6 months? It’s a great alternative to meds and corrects insulin resistance and re-sets your cravings for carbs as well as lowering a1c. Once healthy numbers are established you can slowly add some carbs back (not back to crazy levels) and can process them healthily.
8. u/joesperrazza [score=1, created=2025-09-17T00:39:09]: Consider Farxiga as an alternative to your current regimen. Speak with your doctor about it. It will cost more, but the pharmaceutical company does offer a savings coupon.

It has made nearly all of my complex chronic illnesses symptoms at least a little better, and some are significantly better (inflammation especially!). As far as for diabetes, my A1C six months ago was 7.2, three months ago it was 6.4, and now (just had it checked two days ago) I’m at 5.6. This is 100% due to the medication as I’m currently too sick to exercise and my diet didn’t change dramatically. My blood sugar is steady as a rock. I’ve decreased metformin from 850 twice a day to 750 once a day and hopefully in three months it’ll be down to 500 once a day. I’ve also decreased jardiance from 25mg to 10mg. I’ve never been on such an effective drug for managing my diabetes, it’s seriously a life saver and a medical miracle. Also, if you don’t want to lose too much weight, you can stay on a low dose just to manage your diabetes, which also makes any side effects far easier to manage. I personally worked up to 5mg and am planning to stay here. I lost 30lbs and I’ve also been taken off high blood pressure meds, and my pain med intake for my autoimmune disease, autonomic disorders and chronic migraines is half what it was before. For me, side effects are super minimal, just a occasional gassiness and minor constipation. I don’t feel great yet, but every week is a little better. This is the first time in five years that I’m getting glimmers of a future that might include more than chronic illness, and a lot of that is thanks to this medication. (Omg ranting and raving and preaching and praising. Promise I’m not some ad bot, though I’d totally take that big pharma money if they wanted to sponsor me. Haha)

12. u/alan_s [score=4, created=2025-09-16T19:33:34]: We really can't offer good advice. Please discuss your dislike for metformin with your doctor who is aware of your full medical situation. If you are not happy with that doctor's treatment seek a second opinion.
13. u/morrigan613 [score=1, created=2025-09-16T15:09:42]: My doctor switched me to Dapagliflozin when I couldn’t tolerate metformin and that seems to be working well for me.
14. u/DarkAndSparkly [score=1, created=2025-09-16T11:03:26]: Metformin doesn’t work for me. It gives me bad stomach issues, and even with diet changes, I wasn’t seeing my numbers come down. Same with glipizide. I’m on Jardiance now, and I like it. No issues with my stomach, and my A1C is dropping. I’m also on Mounjaro and insulins, as I’m type 2 and they’re needed, but the jardiance is better for me for the pill.
15. u/RetiredToExplore [score=1, created=2025-09-16T09:38:29]: #1 you need a new doctor. If it really is only pre-diabetes, you certainly don't need two medicines. And glipizide is an ancient outdated medicine that nobody uses. It has a risk of hypoglycemia especially since you are still in the pre-diabetes stage. I agree with all the comments about sustained release metformin. That likely will help. The wild nights shouldn't occur because you're already taking metformin and have a little bit of tolerance to it. Do you know what your A1C is?
16. u/Maleficent_Bit2033 [score=2, created=2025-09-16T07:39:36]: I use the extended release of Metformin and rarely have any side effects. As others have said, there are many different types of medications that can be taken for diabetes, all have some side effects. Talk to your doctor about your issues and see if there is something that would work better for you.
17. u/Press-74 [score=1, created=2025-09-16T06:52:57]: I was switched to Januvia
18. u/hexen84 [score=2, created=2025-09-16T06:51:57]: Definitely talk to the doc about the side effects. If you haven't tried the extended release formula (metformin) it has helped some people with side effects. Plus I swear there are at least 100 different prescriptions available for diabetes so they should be able to help get something different you've given the metformin a try and the side effects haven't improved.
