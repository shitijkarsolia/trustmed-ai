===============================================================================

I’m 6ft, 297 lbs., 49 y/o black male. Got some blood work done today for a pre-employment physical and was told my a1c was like 12 something. This is all mew to me so I asked the doctor what it should be and she said 6 something. I was prescribed metformin but she debated between this and ozempic. I have to start monitoring my blood sugar every day evidently as well. Is this something that can be controlled with just diet and exercise? Is the a1c something that can take a long time to get down to a reasonable level? I’m guessing I should quit smoking as well? Sorry if these are silly questions but I’m just worried it might be too late to make a change.

It can be done and please know it’s a journey, not a quick fix. It gets better with small “wins” that add up over time. You’ve got this!

Went from 9 something to 6.1 in 3 months. I keep working at it. Its doable, takes work and its hard. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself grace to fail and retry. Good luck!
3. u/GenRN817 [score=3, created=2025-09-17T17:30:43]: Check out Dr. Fung, Dr. Berg, Dr. Ken Berry (and many more) on YouTube, they changed my life. I started intermittent fasting and changed my diet and went from a 6.2 to 5.7 to 5.3 most recently. Go back to your doctor and discuss a GLP-1 (a Ozempic/Wegovy, etc )over metformin. Type 2 diabetes is reversible with diet and exercise. After eating, exercise. Just a 15 minute walk or squats can help tremendously. Cut out all processed foods. Cut out all starchy carbs. You can heal yourself.

It was a combination of diet, exercise, and medication. If you have a primary care doctor, work with them to figure out what's right for you. When I went to the ER in December for high glucose (it was over 500), the doctor there put me on Metformin, 500mg morning and night. When I saw my pcp in January, she put me on insulin as well, and then I saw another doctor for follow-up a week later, and he put me on Mounjaro as well, which is similar to Ozempic. I'm off of everything but Mounjaro now and my blood sugar is nearly normal unless I eat a lot of carbs.

I quit all sugar and read every label for their hidden names. I only ate stevia or monk fruit. No flour unless coconut or almond. I only ate low glycemic veggie only raspberries, blueberries, strawberries. I found a protein shake I liked Oath brand and Oywn at Costco. Lots of chicken, tuna, salmon with the occasional steak, sort of keto. I know this sounds restrictive, but it really wasn’t. Instead of metformin, I was prescribed Mounjaro which helped me control my diet. I got a Stelo continuous glucose monitor. I ate 40g carbs a day and 100-130 G protein. Educate yourself, ask your doctor for a referral for a dietitian. YouTube Glucose Goddess explained it in a way I could understand, especially what foods to eat first. Yesterday, September 17th my A1C was 7.6. Get serious or die, your choice.
7. u/Emergency-Hippo2797 [score=1, created=2025-09-17T02:56:27]: I’m in the same boat, just got diagnosed Day Five. I’m going to try the Keto route as I’m already exercising.
8. u/Ok-Seaworthiness-542 [score=5, created=2025-09-16T20:40:35]: Diet, exercise, quit smoking, and meds. Don't try to avoid the meds. Just start them and get it under control. When it is under control you can talk to the doctor about trying to get off the meds. Diabetes damages your body. The sooner you get it under control the less damage (at least slow it down). Here's a good reason to get it under control as soon as possible: ED.
9. u/alan_s [score=4, created=2025-09-16T19:47:56]: &gt;I have to start monitoring my blood sugar every day evidently as well. Daily is the bare minimum. &gt;Is this something that can be controlled with just diet and exercise? Yes for many people but not necessarily for all. Diet will be the base for your diabetes management; exercise helps but meds are basically aids to an appropriate diet. I wrote this to help you begin: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all. &gt;I’m guessing I should quit smoking as well? Yes: [Smoking and Diabetes](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2008/12/smoking-and-diabetes.html)
10. u/donwuann [score=2, created=2025-09-16T16:49:18]: As many other will mention, try keto lifestyle. Very similar story to yours years ago and its very doable. Discipline is key. And most importantly its okay to fuck up. Ive been diabetic for 10 years and I fall off the wagon every once in a while. Also, social eating is probably the hardest part. Its okay to say no, just dont sound to preachy about your new found life. Shit stops hurting when you have little to no inflammation (sugar/carbs in my world).
11. u/Extension_Tax5636 [score=3, created=2025-09-16T15:56:52]: If you are serious about controlling your diabetes, here's what worked for me: - cut out almost all carbs and sugar. It's hard at first and you can have a cheat day once in awhile, but this, in my opinion, is the most important thing. This means no fast food. Again, hard at first, but you get used to it. I haven't had fast food in 10 months. I dont miss it anymore And im down 27 lbs. - exercise at least 30 minutes per day if possible. Even if its just a walk. - do your research. Theres a ton of good info out there that will help you do the things to bring that A1C level down. - monitor your blood 2 or 3 times per day in the beginning. It will help you determine what spikes your sugar levels. - have a cheat meal once in awhile, just dont go overboard. - definitely quit smoking. Good luck.
12. u/Mtnmaggots [score=2, created=2025-09-16T14:11:08]: I went from 14.6 to 6.1 in three months from initial diagnosis. Stay on this site to learn from others. Everyone is different but you will get really good feedback. No sugar, low carbs and plenty of walking. I’m 56. Be diligent. You got this!
13. u/Generations18 [score=3, created=2025-09-16T13:33:43]: I was a bit higher when I found out. Took less than a year to get it to 7 and another 6 months to get it below 6. No meds just diet and exercise. BUT here's the thing. Thats me, maybe not you. Im way older, way shorter, and female. I could still lose 20 pounds. Talk to your doctor, get a plan and do that. Meds do not have to be forever and really help some people. Not silly questions, GOOD questions. And its NEVER too late
14. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=2, created=2025-09-16T13:20:07]: I was diagnosed with an a1c of around 12 as well. Take your meds as ordered. See if you can get your doctor to order a continuous glucose monitor. It will make things so much easier to determine what foods raise your blood sugar level. My a1c is down to 6. Do daily walks or exercise. Be aware the physical activity can raise your blood sugar levels as well, so don't freak out. Be prepared to feel like your blood sugar levels are low, when they aren't. It's your body adjusting to new lower levels. It will take some time to get it all sorted. And stay away from fast food and junk food. That's how most of us got diabetes.
