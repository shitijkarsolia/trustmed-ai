Something I’ve noticed about type 2 diabetes is how different fasting numbers can be compared to post-meal numbers. Sometimes the fasting is the hardest to control, even when meals look good. Have you noticed the same?

I spike to about 200 around 10pm for an unknown reason (I've experimented with different foods, exercise, schedule...), then it falls to 110 and stays there. All. Night. Long. It barely wiggles even after I get up and start my day. It will go to about 125 after my coffee around an hour after I'm up, and only then does it fall below 100. I don't understand my body.

3. u/Mimi-The-Minx [score=1, created=2025-09-17T07:31:26]: I tend to wake up with the opposite really low blood sugar &amp; it makes me feel pretty awful..I have literally cut out junk, cut my carbs down to very low &amp; sweet treats ..I love yoghurt &amp; fruit I can't give them up completely .. I'm learning what things give me high numbers &amp; to avoid @ all cost..
4. u/ShopNerd [score=4, created=2025-09-17T05:24:09]: I do notice a spike usually around 3 am most mornings and I do notice I'm more reactive to carbs on an empty stomach. If I have nothing in me and have a single cookie my numbers spike the same as if I have 2 pieces of avocado toast with eggs. Basically breakfast for me has to be low carb as possible to keep the morning numbers in check
