===============================================================================

So I went to the doctor in August and my fasting sugar was high at 130. I am a 53 year old male, 6’2 and I was 220. They did not do an a1c at the time. In June I started eating better and eliminated most carbs. I hate to think what my A1C was before then. I bought a meter and an A1C test. I started testing my bg and I was consistently in the 130 to 160 range that first week. My a1c on the home meter was 8.5 a few days later. I was pretty devastated because my feet were experiencing neuropathy symptoms. My mom died off this stupid disease so I know how bad it can get. I cleaned up my diet further. I started running 30 minutes 3 times a week, walking 25,000 steps plus a day, and began lifting weights. I have lost 13 pounds since August 1st. So my bg have gone into the normal range, with the exception of mornings and the stupid dawn phenomenon. I have also fine tuned my diet to keep my bg down with a CGM. My bg has averaged 109 on the CGM. My feet symptoms have mostly disappeared. Today my a1c was 6.1. I am pretty stoked. I have read these home a1c tests can be as much as .5 off, but at its worst I still have dropped that number a lot. I just want to share that diet and exercise make a massive difference. The CGM really has helped me dial it in, even though it reads high. I have about 20 more pounds to lose to get rid of this visceral fat, but man does that make me hopeful. Thank you guys for your feedback here. It has been invaluable and 1000 times more helpful than the doctor. 😉

If you were looking for inexpensive A1c testing, you can always get a real lab test at ownyourlabs without insurance and pay less than the cost of the OTC versions.

If you need some extra inspiration see this guy on You Tube (Beat Diabetes Dennis Pollock) not much he doesn’t know about the disease I don’t follow everything he does as everyone has different conditions but he has helped me significantly.

My A1C was high for years - denial, and just not taking care of myself because the drugs were there, right? Well then diabetes started affecting my eye. I had a bad infection a few years ago, and it wasn't healing and my GP was freaking out. Then a good friend of ours lost his foot and toes on another foot. Decided I wanted to die with ALL my body parts so cleaned up my act. My A1C is in the 6.5 - 6.6 region. I'm trying to get it under 6.0 but right now, my doctor is happy that 85% of my readings are within an acceptable range.
