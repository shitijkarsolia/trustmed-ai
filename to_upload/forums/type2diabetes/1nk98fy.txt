===============================================================================

I went to the dermatologist for a rash on my leg in July and a few days later was diagnosed with Necrobiosis Lipoidica which is a rare skin condition with close links to diabetes. Looking back, I have all the usual symptoms of T2 (excessive thirst, fatigue after eating, frequent urination), so it all made sense. I’m also overweight and it runs in my family. The first appointment I could get with my PCP isn’t until 10/17, so I decided to make matters into my own hands for the time being. I’ve lost 24lbs over the last 6.5 weeks, consume less than 30g of carbs per day, and walk a minimum of 10k steps per day. I feel (felt?) great! Yesterday I had a dizzy spell that lasted several hours so I bought glucose monitor (should’ve weeks ago) and my sugar was 136 after a few hours of eating so not too bad. This morning, though, my fasting number was 183! Part of me is afraid to know what it was before and the other part is extremely disheartened that it’s still so high. I know fasting is the hardest to lower and I’m going this unmediated right now, but it’s still frustrating! Again, just think I needed to vent to folks who understand the struggle. Also any tips for controlling fasting would be incredibly appreciated!
