===============================================================================

Went for my latest A1C and honestly I was expecting an increase. My self-control has been pretty bad over the last few months. A few too many night outs with the family, and friends plus a good friend of mine was staying over and he knows how to cook! But much to my surprise, my A1C actually went down. Not a lot, but from 6.6 mmol/l (May) to 6.5 mmol/l (September). They didn't check cholesterol, or ferratin (I don't eat a lot of meat so take supplements) this time. But looking at the history of my results, I'm glad where the numbers are going. Going to try hard to get that 6.5 mmol/l to at or below 6.0 for my next A1C (which is freaking hard when you live in a house where nobody is diabetic and can enjoy carbs galore). EDIT: I would also say that intermittent fasting is probably the one strategy that has helped me significantly in keeping my A1C and daily numbers low. I IF 16:8 and often stretches longer as I just get busy. I try and hydrate as much as I can, and usually start the day with black coffee (flavored) or green tea and try and drink at least 2l - 3l of water daily (not hitting that mark recently). My first meal usually is around 300 - 500 calories so usually a protein drink (sugar free) and protein bar, or eggs. Last few days I've overindulged though (bagel + egg sandwich) but I've been trying to add more protein if I'm having carbs to slow the absorption down and avoid the spike.

They have a sweet cinnamon flavor that’s like a crepe especially toasted and filled with fresh berries. High protein, low carb and calories and I do not feel deprived. They have several flavors and are not expensive. Good luck on your next test.
