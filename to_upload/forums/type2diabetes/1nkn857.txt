===============================================================================

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I want to share my story and ask for advice as I prepare for my upcoming GP appointment. I know this is a bit long, but I appreciate you bearing with me. I recently changed my GP, and since both my parents have diabetes (along with other related health issues), he asked me to do a full set of tests. On August 16th, my results showed an HbA1c of 12.7% and fasting blood glucose of 14 mmol/L, plus vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies. Despite these high numbers, I never really felt diabetic except sometimes feeling very low energy after high carb meals. My GP prescribed Metformin over the phone—starting with 500 mg once a day before bed, then increased to twice a day after a follow-up call checking for side effects. Since the diagnosis, I’ve made significant lifestyle changes based on what I’ve learned from diabetic forums on Reddit: Quit smoking cold turkey (was smoking 10 cigarettes/day) Started daily workouts — 20 minutes treadmill + 40 minutes strength training Added 20-minute walk after dinner and 5-minute walks after breakfast and lunch Reduced carbs from ~350g (mostly refined) to 100–120g (complex carbs like ancient grain bread, lentils, beans) Followed recommended diabetic meal portions: half plate veggies, quarter protein, quarter carbs After one month, my latest HbA1c dropped to 9.8%, and my weight decreased slightly from 69 kg to 67 kg (BMI already normal). I also used a Libre Freestyle 2 CGM on a 15-day trial; it estimated my HbA1c at 5.0%, with readings mostly in the normal range. I have a GP appointment this Monday — my first since diagnosis — and I want to discuss the possibility of remission. I’m unsure what to ask, such as: Should I ask for a referral to a diabetes specialist or dietitian? How do I approach asking about remission and the path to it? Should I confirm exactly which type of diabetes I have? Would it be helpful to show my GP my CGM reports from LibreView? Are there any other lifestyle or medication changes I should consider beyond what I’m already doing? I’m new to managing this and would appreciate any advice on questions to ask, managing diabetes moving forward, or general tips. Thanks in advance!

That is probably wise but based on your description type 2 appears to be most likely. &gt;Reduced carbs from \~350g (mostly refined) to 100–120g (complex carbs like ancient grain bread, lentils, beans) Followed recommended diabetic meal portions: half plate veggies, quarter protein, quarter carbs That is not a bad starting point but you can use your meter to fine-tune it. Note that it is carbs per meal which matters, not carbs per day. You are likely to find your carb limits are different for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

That said, here’s how I would handle your questions as a US citizen: &gt;Should I ask for a referral to a diabetes specialist or dietitian? Yes. &gt;How do I approach asking about remission and the path to it? You can ask, but the truth is that it takes several months of weight loss for it to be in remission, and even then it can always come back. Focus on making the healthy lifestyle changes and it will take care of itself. You can’t really go back to unmonitored carefree eating with a sedentary lifestyle. &gt;Should I confirm exactly which type of diabetes I have? You haven’t already?!? &gt;Would it be helpful to show my GP my CGM reports from LibreView? Yup. An endocrinologist can subscribe to your CGM reports and gets notified when something goes wrong. Your GP may or may not be with it. Is your GP a nurse or a real doctor? My experience is that nurses suck at managing diabetes. &gt;Are there any other lifestyle or medication changes I should consider beyond what I’m already doing? Sounds like you got it, just focus on getting those blood sugar numbers lower. The weight should come off and the symptoms will mostly go away.
