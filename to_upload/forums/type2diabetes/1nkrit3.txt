It can be at the stage where if you have any sort of an excursion that day, with no easy access to toilets, you’re best just not medicating that day. I had crapped three times before lunch while I was in work, I went for a walk and ended up having to find a toilet during my one hour lunch. On the walk back I needed the toilet again so just about got back to work in time. It’s a pain in the arse.

A doctor knows better than internet strangers what your medical needs are. Side effects of each medication fan be found online at the manufacturers’ websites. There are way too many meds for anyone to give you all of this information.
