===============================================================================

I’ll try to keep this reasonably short (spoiler: I didn’t, sorry). It’s pretty much just a vent, since I’m almost positive things aren’t going to turn out the way the surgeon seems to think they will. I was diagnosed August 12. A1c was 9.4. The blood test was in preparation for a pair of surgeries we were looking to schedule. Naturally, my diagnosis put the surgeries on hold. I was not able to see the endocrinologist until August 22. She prescribed metformin and a glucose monitor. Unfortunately, insurance hangups meant I wasn’t able to get any of that until the following Thursday, August 28. I was given a chart to keep my blood sugar readings, which I’ve done faithfully along with keeping a spreadsheet of what I’ve eaten so I know how to correlate any changes in my numbers. One of the surgeons called me last week and I told him things were going well, I was staying well under 180 which was the number the endocrinologist gave me. He sounded very pleased and told me his scheduler would start working with the other surgeon to find a good date. Yesterday, the scheduler called and gave me a date of October 13 – but I have to get my A1c checked again before they’ll confirm that. They want it under 8.0. Right away, I’m like, *is that even possible*? I haven’t been monitoring/taking the metformin for an entire month yet, and they expect me to drop that far? So I was disappointed all over again. I know a 9.4 is generally an average of 223, and an 8 is 183. But still, even though I started changing my diet right after I was diagnosed, I have no idea what my numbers were for the next two weeks after that. While I’ve changed my diet in a big way and have lost 20 pounds already, there’s still the two months prior that are going to mess me up. I just don’t have very high hopes, let’s put it that way. And the most frustrating part is expressing that doubt and having it brushed off.

Keep your carbs under 40 per day real carbs not net carbs and get your protein high. Drink lots of water. I have the free fitness pal so I can plan my carbs before I eat. You might like the Glucose Goddess on YouTube for down to earth explanation.

What was on the menu yesterday in detail? Read this to see why I ask: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

4. u/ExternalScale8119 [score=3, created=2025-09-20T08:29:44]: Please describe your diet... It need to be low carb to reduce your blood sugar. The blood sugar HbA1c goes 3-4 months back, so dont expect to be down in a 1 1/2 month.
5. u/Equivalent-Yoghurt38 [score=2, created=2025-09-20T08:29:09]: If you’re consistently staying under 180, your A1C will drop. Heres the rub though, A1C is around a 3 month average, so your average is skewed by starting high. That being said, there are other numbers you can use like GMI to estimate future A1C. I have a feeling you’ll be okay. Just for reference of how fast things can change, I was diagnosed about the same time at 10.2. I’m staying below 150 as much as possible and my average BS is now 122 and GMI 6.2 since starting treatment.
