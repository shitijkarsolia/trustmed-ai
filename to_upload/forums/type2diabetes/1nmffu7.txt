===============================================================================

Just got a CGM and set it up. used to do the pin prick twice a day and I thought I had my food figured out but my tests came back high so I moved to a CGM. and just a few hours later and I'm depressed. I had half a cup of brown rice, steamed broccoli and fish for lunch and it was around 176 and hovered there. Then I had a snack around 4:30 with sardines and multi grain bread and it spiked to 220. I went for an hour walk and it dropped down to 196 but I'm just sitting down and it's rising again! Is it calibrating? Or is this normal? I'm on 1000 mg of metformin daily. UPDATE: my CGM is whack! I started calibration after all the advice I got here and whadya know? The CGM showed 176 and finger prick was 124! I knew it was off because I had just woken up and was hungry. I will calibrate better when I have to change this! Thank you all.

Being aware of what you’re eating is helping even if a spike happens, I’m learning it can be so many other things aside from my food. stress, work, other things all cause spikes, and it has truly helped me with how I mange not just my diabetes, but life on life’s terms also! Best of luck!

It's time to review your portions and timing of all your carbs, including bread and rice: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)
4. u/TaleDowntown5035 [score=5, created=2025-09-21T14:45:18]: I have just had a CGM and this was my exact experience. My takeaway - my diabetes isn't managed well enough with my current medication, and so I need more/different treatment. It's a progressive disease, and if you're eating like this and still getting high numbers (I'm from NZ so we use different reference ranges) - your pancreas needs more help.
5. u/FranceBrun [score=3, created=2025-09-21T13:28:49]: I just want to say, is your numbers ever seem wack, do a finger stick to make sure it’s not off. I have had this happen plenty of times. Once you see it’s working normally, you don’t have to worry again. But I’ve had a few weird sensors.
6. u/Bracebridge_Dinner [score=8, created=2025-09-21T12:36:00]: The CGM gives you INVALUABLE insight as to how YOUR body processes different foods. Yes, it can be depressing at first. BUT, take the information and learn from it. When you begin to change your daily diet and you start seeing better results, it's one of the best feelings in the world. It just takes time. Keep the script flipped. When you recognize that a specific doesn't processes well in your body, fight the urge to think CAN'T HAVE....think let me REPLACE IT with something BETTER! One change at a time. It won't get fixed immediately but it CAN be made better. ✨️✨️
7. u/Fancy_Leshy [score=4, created=2025-09-21T10:51:25]: I take a finger prick every once in a while just to make sure the CGM is on the right track. CGM takes glucose data from a different substance than just blood like the finger prick does. I also find that the first 24-72 hours of a new CGM can be a bit whacko but it usually starts to even out and be more consistent and correct by the third day. Always finger prick if you're unsure!
8. u/Maria_Dragon [score=2, created=2025-09-21T10:13:08]: I find that some days are simply better for me. I recommend monitoring your CGM for two weeks to notice trends. I usually only eat 1/3 cup brown rice at most and I don't eat grains/starchy foods with every meal. Trying to work short walks into your day helps. Don't beat yourself up. View this as an ongoing experiment.
9. u/MeasurementSame9553 [score=3, created=2025-09-21T10:05:06]: Try and flip your script mentally. Say I am doing everything I can to get as healthy as possible. I am going to make huge progress. I know it’s difficult but a lot of us with type 2 have done this and works by getting your mind right. Just continue you moving more each day. It will all work out. 🏋️
10. u/smitty2444 [score=2, created=2025-09-21T09:36:00]: I don't pay particular attention to the CGM numbers; I only use it to spot trends...they won't be as accurate as a finger prick. They only measure your skins interstitial fluid, not your actual blood. So you should do some comparisons to see just how far off the mark yours is compared to using your finger prick meter. I've noticed that when my BS is stable the comparison numbers are fairly close, but when my BS is on the move, the comparison numbers can be wildly different. I always try to stay away from potatoes, rice and bananas; they give me pretty big spikes, but as far as general advice, "always eat to your meter".
11. u/iamcraby [score=4, created=2025-09-21T08:46:20]: that's exactly what you need in order to learn more about food, nutrition, and how it *actually* impacts your blood sugar levels. you'll start reading nutrition labels more, you'll begin to stop believing several myths, and make better choices overall!
12. u/Dangerous-Agent-9017 [score=3, created=2025-09-21T05:12:11]: carbs are evil and so is sugar and all its hidden names, checkout the Glucose Godess YouTube to educate yourself on how food works
13. u/rogerman1234 [score=9, created=2025-09-21T05:06:47]: First change the order of food. Like you would eat broccoli and then fish and then little bit of brown rice(if you really need it or replace it with quinoa). Secondly, don’t trust these whole grain/multi-grain breads, they are just full of carbs and will jack up your sugar high. Also, I have seen that if I do cycling on a stationary bike for 15 mins, I can bring my blood sugar down quickly. I have been using Cgm for past 3 years and have a learnt a ton
14. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=3, created=2025-09-21T04:46:15]: Do verify the CGM readings with a high quality finger stick meter at times when blood glucose levels are flat, such as before meals, if you want to check the 'bias', the variance of the sensor. The basic standards for these devices leave quite a lot of room for discrepancies, and it's difficult to estimate the bias when levels are changing rapidly due to the lag time with CGM readings versus actual blood readings. Once you know the bias you can put the CGM readings into context and see if they might be on the high side. It's worth keeping in mind also that if you're recently diagnosed and can afford to lose weight you may be able to lower your fasting level, your baseline, very significant by losing the excess weight. If you have weight to lose then you might find you regain more freedom with your diet once the weight loss is done.
15. u/smhdg2023 [score=3, created=2025-09-21T03:38:25]: Getting a CGM was a great learning experience for me. Give it a little time and you’ll figure out how to control your blood glucose. And you’ll feel so much better!
16. u/ac7ss [score=5, created=2025-09-20T22:39:26]: A CGM fills in the gaps. I thought I was doing well before they put me on a CGM. I was very wrong. It took about a week to get my numbers within range, and I learned a lot in that time. It's a great learning tool. I found that I would spike on waking (This is normal) and sometimes it would creep up independent of eating or not eating.
17. u/Fredredphooey [score=8, created=2025-09-20T20:34:49]: If you're going to eat carbs, you need to eat them at the end of the meal. It's been proven that if you eat something green at the top of your meal, then the protein, then carbs, your blood sugar will be lower than if you ate it in reverse or mixed up. Example: a little salad or broccoli or even just a couple celery sticks to start. Your protein, animal or plant, then a small amount of low glycemic carbs. You're better off switching to quinoa, wild rice (a grass not a rice), millet, barley and buckwheat instead of rice and potatoes, too.
18. u/jolard [score=9, created=2025-09-20T20:12:36]: Rice and bread, that might be the problem. I can't eat any type of rice without spiking, and only specially made keto bread is always good for me.
19. u/plantaholic2 [score=3, created=2025-09-20T19:45:42]: My husband started using that and we went back to finger pricks because it was really really high and when we would double check with the finger it was not that high. We used it for about three or four months and then when we went to the doctor to check his A1c, we were thinking we were gonna get the worst results because that machine said his sugar was so high and come to find out, the doctor thinks that it was falsely high because his A1c had actually dropped which the finger pricks indicated.
20. u/RetiredToExplore [score=5, created=2025-09-20T19:44:16]: I have a couple of thoughts that may be a little help. 1. Don't trust one food/blood sugar pair, it could be a fluke, also depends on what else you are with it out of it was on an enjoy stomach 2. Don't trust bread marketing labels. Sour dough and pumpernickel are generally best but find a brand that works. 3. You may be experiencing a couple "truth hurts" moments. You said your overall numbers were bad, v now CGM is your "teacher" to help you fix that A1c. Hang in there. You will figure it out!
