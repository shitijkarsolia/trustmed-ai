===============================================================================

I’ve had several sensors go bad after a few days, but my last two were spot on. I thought maybe there was a bad lot of them. My faulty sensors always seem to go low. Regular BGM tests prove these are false lows and nowhere near close to my actual numbers. I’m starting to think it’s me. While their return and replacement policy is a good one, I’m kind of tired going through the process. https://preview.redd.it/v5e15i9clgqf1.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0929da7f1cdf4db41eba55f3d201fbf2ff948ee

2. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=1, created=2025-09-22T01:56:38]: I removed this sensor and flying solo for a couple weeks. it actually felt good not checking the app. I‘m pretty certain of my diet and how it moves my numbers. Gotta decide if I want to try another sensor or not. 🤔
