===============================================================================

It's been almost a year since being diagnosed with type 2. I'm trying to stay off medication as long as I can and just treat myself with diet and lifestyle. I've been counting carbs like my dietitian told me to, but I'm wondering, have any of you had success using Weight Watchers? I've always liked their app and the support from their community forum and the leaders there. I just need some way to keep on track. Counting carbs works but I need some accountability. I fall off the wagon too much! TIA.

Blood glucose control is priority one. &gt;I've been counting carbs like my dietitian told me to Your meter or CGM is your personal best advisor: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

That is until I got serious and followed the plan with a scale being my best friend. 🙂 It just works but there’s a catch, you have to stay on the program just like any other diet. I use it now to check carbs and keep track until I lose the last few pounds to my goal weight. To be honest, I’m bit nervous coming off it when I get there, but I can always join again.

I found it a bit too restrictive but I believe you can switch back an forth between that one and the regular program. The community is great for the most part. I just did the online version. Keep an eye out for sales. I would never pay the full price but you can usually find a decent deal one every few months particularly if you sign up for 6 or 12 months.
