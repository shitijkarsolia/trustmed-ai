Since you aren't on medication, it's probably possible. Keep exercising (probably more endurance training than HIIT), be stricter with diet, and get enough rest. Medication like metformin XR would probably immediately solve it, but you probably have medical reasons to not taking it, I doubt you'd put fear of a little pill over your health. Stay strong and stay patient.
