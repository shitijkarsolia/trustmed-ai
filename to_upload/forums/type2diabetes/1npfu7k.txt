Hello.. new here 🙃 I am on 500 mg of metformin. My doctor didn't tell me when to take it so I've been taking it at night after dinner. I am also on mounjaro so I don't have much of an appetite in the morning to take the medicine then. I tested the few morning after 12 hours and it's been around 120-130. Is there a good time to take the medicine. Also if I wake up and drink a sparkling water (I like the ICE ones) they say no sugar but would that affect my number?

I am not an expert, but I think artificial sweeteners affect people differently. Some might cause one persons glucose to raise and some else might not raise. You would need to test your blood sugar before and after to know for sure.

The elevated glucose in the morning is typical and should improve with better control. Look up dawn phenomenon for more information about higher morning glucose
