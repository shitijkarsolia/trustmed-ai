Do you guys go through weeks where your glucose levels are just high? How do you deal with it? Sometimes I feel like it's lack of sleep that's causing my high's. I would wake up anywhere from 110-140 and the dawn phenomenon would kick in, and it would skyrocket to 180 mg/dl and stay at 140 until the evening. Nothing seems to bring it down--fasting, low carb, no carb, exercise. I've been up early to walk for at least an hour every day but it's still high. I had a crazy week earlier this week and haven't been getting as much sleep, but I've been sleep deprived before without seeing these high's. it' s amazing how much other stuff affects your glucose levels (sleep, stress, heat, you name it). What do you do on days or weeks like these? I am new at this, and I can't afford a CGM so I've been using my meter. I try to eat to my meter, but sometimes I spike after eating things with no carbs (like eggs!). Lately I've been keeping my net carbs at 20-25 g, but my total carbs is around 70-80g (mostly from fiber).

2. u/StJmagistra [score=3, created=2025-09-26T03:49:52]: Stress hormones spike your blood glucose levels. Lack of sleep is stressful on your body. Just because you could do X when you were younger doesn’t mean your body can regulate itself when you do X now.
