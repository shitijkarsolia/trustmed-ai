===============================================================================

About two weeks ago, I had a bad yeast infection under my bra. It cleared up with gold bond and lotrimin. A week later, I had a vaginally yeast infection. I took a pill and it resolved. Well, now I have one in my buttcrack. I've been using lotrimin spray but it burns like fire. I can't get to the Dr until Oct. 13. My blood sugar is controlled. Any suggestions?

To the point I have to shower twice per day or else I'll be itchy. I use this anti fungal soap that's made with tea tree, and that gives me relief. But it hasn't cured it.

I also 2nd using dandruff shampoo. You can use it on your body. I get them under my breasts from time to time and I will use dandruff shampoo under them.
5. u/Bracebridge_Dinner [score=1, created=2025-09-27T05:16:18]: Are you, by chance, taking Jardiance? This drug can cause yeast infections.
6. u/ArkieRN [score=1, created=2025-09-27T02:14:45]: Are your blood sugars under control? With that many yeast infections they’re probably high. If you’re not checking them regularly then it could help to start. If they are high it may be time to see the doctor for a medication adjustment.
7. u/hexen84 [score=2, created=2025-09-27T00:03:21]: Head and shoulders or most dandruff shampoo has Zinc pyrithione as the active ingredient which is an antifungal and can help with external yeast infections.
8. u/Erza88 [score=2, created=2025-09-26T21:19:25]: Boric acid vaginal suppositories until you can get to the doctor. Or call your Dr and see if they can recommend anything in the meantime. I assume they'd say to try any of the over-the-counter medicines.
