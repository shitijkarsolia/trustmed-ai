===============================================================================

I’ve been having abdominal pain on and off since January, it’s localized to the right side. I’ve had every test under the sun, and no diagnosis has been found. I can’t recall when I increased my metformin but I was taking 1000mg twice a day, increased from 500mg twice a day. Could the increase be my issue? No other nausea or digestive issues. Just consistent right side pain, lasts a few weeks to a month and then comes back a couple months later.

They showed up on an unrelated ultrasound right when I was starting Metformin but didn’t start causing pain (severe, severe attacks) until about a year later, and even then, they weren’t unable to definitively diagnose me until during an active attack when my gallbladder was at that point severely inflamed.

5. u/reddicted1304 [score=1, created=2025-09-27T08:00:59]: Obvious as it states to take after a meal,are you doing that?
