===============================================================================

Hello everyone. Before I start i want to say everything that has and will happen to me was absolutely my fault. Ive abused my body for decades, even after my type 2 diabetes diagnosis. I'm talking decades of opioids (prescription), smoking, eating everything i wanted, and so on. Miraculously i was never a drinker, lol. With that, what happened to me was avoidable. I should have pushed harder when the hospital staff was tunnel visioned on my diabetes. It starts in February. I was feeling terrible. I lost 20 something pounds, I'm lethargic, and I'm suffering from quite a bit of foot pain. I go to the VA Hospital ER with my complaints, the docs see high blood sugar, give me metformin and send me on my way. Over the next several months i'm doing worse and worse. I lost another 20 something pounds, my foot is more painful, and everyone thought I was dying. I thought that as well. So come June I went from obese to my minimum healthy weight. I can barely get out of bed. Then, I get severe constipation that is bad enough that I go back to the ER. At this point my blood sugar and A1C levels have reached holy poop levels, and I get admitted. I'm there for 3 days, they give me an insulin prescription, and send me on my way. Do you know what spikes blood sugar levels? Bone infections! I was home for three days and the swelling began. Then came the redness. Then the swelling became so severe my skin was beginning to tear. This all took around three days. Well, back to the ER convinced I had tendinitis, gout, or both. I figured it couldn't be that bad. The ER blew off my complaints twice already convincing me my only issue was high blood sugar. When I got there the third time the doctors instantly knew what it was. It was too late and I lost my big toe and surrounding area. So anyway, please don't let the doctors dismiss you so easily. Sometimes there is much more going on. If my infection was caught in February, I would still have my big toe. If my infection was caught in June, I would still have my big toe. It's still on me, I should have followed up with specialists, but I will say I was too weak to take care of myself at that point. Severe infections don't make for great thinking ability. Please, please, please follow up with your symptoms until you've been satisfied. Ironically, I think this probably saved my life. Not just because I am taking things seriously now, but because other issues have been revealed. I need another (third) surgery on my foot, but this time I need my PCP and cardiology clearance. My PCP ordered chest x-rays and I found out I have a fractured rib, lol. You'd think I'd know, lol. Cardiology results are much worse. A chemical stress test revealed i most likely had a heart attack (again, you'd think I'd know), which led to a cardiac catheter. So yeah, lots of blockage and I'm getting scheduled for bypass surgery. My consultation is on the 8th. I lost a toe, and it's just sucked, but it probably helped me avoid an inevitable lethal heart attack.

We are left to figure out things for ourselves. I’ll pr as y for your full recovery. Having diabetes is no joke. Took me a long time to realize just how serious it really is. It just kinda sneaks up on you. I wish you the best of luck and hard work. 🌸
2. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=5, created=2025-09-28T21:43:14]: This is the reason I started taking better care of myself. I know several people in their mid-late 50s and older who have lost limbs or have very poor eyesight due to uncontrolled diabetes. OP - Sorry for what you are going through. 😞

I’m 47 and diagnoses 2 months ago. I immediately changed everything but I also abused my body for a long time. I was a heroin addict, I drank before the heroin. I did a lot of drugs. I smoked I ate carbs all day and ice cream every night after dinner. I have been clean for 10 years, I quit smoking about 5 months ago. Diabetes diagnosis was 2 months ago. It’s scary to see what can happen if we don’t make the changes our body so desperately is begging for. I’m not glad this happened to you but I hope it’s brought you clarity and understanding that your body deserves more. 🩵
