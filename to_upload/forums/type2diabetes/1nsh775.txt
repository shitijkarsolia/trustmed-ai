===============================================================================

How do you guys deal with the shame of giving in to moments of weakness? I managed to bring my numbers down to prediabetic levels, but i am a work in progress. For the past three months I have been watching my diet and exercising regularly. Over the past few days life was getting overwhelming and I couldn't do it. I did not watch what I was eating and starting eating foods that were convenient. Could not bring myself to go out for a walk or get movement in. I feel like I keep playing with fire. What do you tell yourself to get back up?

3. u/LagerBoi [score=2, created=2025-09-28T21:46:24]: I will never feel shame or guilt for having something that I enjoy.

I made a simple rule for myself for treats when I was newly diagnosed. I could eat whatever I liked whenever I liked but I ***must*** test one hour later. No meter = no treat. It did not take long for high numbers on my meter to make many of those treats look less delicious and more poisonous. I know that sounds too simple. Try it. It works.

6. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=7, created=2025-09-28T10:44:41]: Honestly, for motivation I go on this subreddit and read the cautionary tale type posts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe that’s bleak but I find it works if I’ve been wilding out or feeling like I want to. Almost certainly will find time for a workout the same day or at least go for a walk. Also for what it’s worth, a few days isn’t that big a deal in the scheme of things UNLESS you don’t pick it back up. I was really worried my last A1C would be awful because I was sick for a few days then being pretty self indulgent for a week or so afterward, but it was actually still slightly better (6.1) than the previous one (6.2).
7. u/jailtheorange1 [score=3, created=2025-09-28T10:10:26]: Went from HbA1c of 107, to 45 a few years back., and over time sailed back up to 105. I've done similar with weight, 330lbs, to 242 lbs, back up to 362 lbs over time. Back down to 292 lbs and 51 A1c, slow enough progress this year. It's hard to get THAT excited about progress again, because I sabotage myself SO MUCH, but I try. I have been holding steady for three weeks instead of progressing, as I could no longer afford Mounjaro last month. Wegovy just doesn't cut it by comparison. Price rises ended up being just about sustainable, so hoping a 5mg MJ pen arrives mid week at latest, and THEN I can more easily get back onto the horse of great glucose control and minimal appetite.

I let up after that and introduced carbs back into my diet but didn’t do a good job of it, and allowed myself to gain 30 lbs and crept to 6.0 within a year. Another year later and I’m back down 20 of the 30lbs (a good thing, I was 115lbs at 4.9) and am at 5.3 as of my latest check. Try not to feel ashamed- this lifestyle is exhausting and not everyone in your life can relate. I came back from a year of overindulging! Just remember it’s a marathon not a sprint, you can do it :)
9. u/alwayslearning_Sue [score=5, created=2025-09-28T08:13:28]: At first I was flawless with my eating and believed I would always be that way. Not because I thought I was better than anyone else, but because I was so terrified. The first time I stumbled was really tough, scary and humbling. I ended up realizing that I was facing the fact in real time that this is the rest of my life. Even though I already knew that in my mind, I need to keep accepting that at a deeper level over and over again. Before diagnosis, with all my losing and gaining back weight, I would slowly just give in and start thinking I’d failed. I think the trick is to get better and faster at getting back on your plan. For me that involves shortening the amount of time I spend beating myself up. I work actively to be kind and gentle with myself, like I would be with a cherished friend. Think about how far you’ve come and recommit. I’ve only been at this for 16 months and I’ve needed to do this multiple times already. Learn about what your triggers are. From your post, it sounds like they’re similar to mine - and are most likely super common. We’re all human. Doing our best is good enough!
10. u/gertymoon [score=3, created=2025-09-28T08:10:42]: It happens to us all, just accept it and get back on track before it gets the better of you. It's easy to fall into bad habits because the bad habits is easier on you but you know better and you know what you have to do.
11. u/TemperTantrumz [score=5, created=2025-09-28T04:05:04]: Zero shame in having a blow out now and again.
12. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=2, created=2025-09-28T01:32:58]: Just go back to being consistent with your blood sugar management. Birthdays, holidays, etc. are inevitable, and I think on those days (if you've been managing your blood sugar well on other days), eating some higher glycemic meals aren't going to do massive damage to your A1C. If you get good at quickly identifying what's low glycemic and what might spike your blood sugar, building your plate of food on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day should be easier because you can create an educated balance.
13. u/chjones5 [score=3, created=2025-09-27T23:51:59]: I’m with you on this. I was diagnosed in January at 11.4. Worked hard and got down to 5.9, but I’ve had moments where life happens and I’m on vacation, or it’s a bday or just a rough couple days. I just remind myself that I’m human, it’s life, and this year I’ve eaten healthier than I ever have in my entire life. A few days of eating poorly won’t take me down, unless I let it. So if I zoom out and ate well for 330 out of 365, that’s a win. I’m new to all this, so someone might come in and tell me those 35 days are reckless and dangerous, but I don’t know, we’re in this for the long-haul.
14. u/PacRimRod [score=4, created=2025-09-27T23:50:19]: No shame, just own it! You had a nice meal/dessert/whatever, you had a spike, now you are back working towards whatever goal you set for yourself.
