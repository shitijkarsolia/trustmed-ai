1. u/joyful115_ [score=2, created=2025-09-29T13:59:49]: Berberine
2. u/mithril2020 [score=3, created=2025-09-29T13:55:03]: Cinnamon, ginseng.
3. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=4, created=2025-09-29T08:42:43]: I've been taking Magnesium for months now and the jury is still out. Like you I'm trying to get any little push I can to help. I tested my A1C today and I'm at 5.0 now, but can't honestly say the magnesium had anything to do with it.
4. u/bohemianattitude [score=5, created=2025-09-29T08:18:55]: Berberine has been proven to be just as effective as Metformin. Also look into Gymnema Sylvestre and Alpha lipoic acid.
5. u/CreativeChaos2023 [score=3, created=2025-09-29T08:14:07]: that hba1c is amazing! It’s in the normal range. Do you need supplements?
6. u/Crabber432 [score=1, created=2025-09-29T08:05:43]: Supplements would just be a band aid. Normal fasting glucose indicates normal hepatic insulin resistance. If your A1c is still high then your insulin resistance is at the skeletal muscle. How much physical activity do you perform? Weight loss is usually the best cure for insulin resistance and diabetes
7. u/yamahamama61 [score=1, created=2025-09-29T07:35:10]: The only way I've been able to control my blood sugar was I tested my B.S. after everything I ate. I learned what I could an could not eat. What shocked me was the chili mix I use to make chili set my blood sugar up to 200. So. On the search so another tasty chili mix
8. u/ToothPickPirate [score=1, created=2025-09-29T07:30:02]: Have you looked into L-Glutamine?
9. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=7, created=2025-09-29T07:19:58]: Supplements don’t control blood sugar. Any literature you find that says they can, I’ll contain the words “some studies suggest…” meaning they don’t, but someone has something to sell
10. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-09-29T07:15:07]: The only ones that ever worked for me were Karela pills (bitter melon) but never enough to make a noticeable difference on my A1C like it was a .5 decrease in A1C, and I felt the cost was not worth it.
