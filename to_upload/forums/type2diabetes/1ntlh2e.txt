===============================================================================

I have gone to four different doctors asking if there is any other medication I can be put on that will help stabilize my blood sugar. Every time I take metformin, even with a meal, it makes me feel incredibly nauseous, and gives me horrible diarrhea. Every doctor has told me to “stick the GI issues out, and it’ll resolve on its own” but I can’t handle this every single day. My A1C is high because for the last four years i’ve struggled to take it consistently. I was recently prescribed the extended release version but I don’t think it will help much either. Any tips? I’ve tried to take it at night before bed, but it also makes me feel nauseous until i’m able to fall asleep.

It was debilitating and I had to tell my doctor that I was not going to take it anymore. She switched me to Januvia and I haven’t had those problems since.

Once I got a CGM and figured out what food doesn't affect me so badly, I was able to stop my metformin. I stopped cold turkey from 2,000 mg/day to 0 and got my A1c down from 6.8 to 5.8. All by changing what I ate. I didn't even add exercise, walks after meals, or start hitting the gym (all good ideas).

And there is no term strong enough to describe the incredible benefits of Mounjaro. I take both. No insulin, no other diabetes drug and my A1C is 7.

He only gave me 3 months to get my sugars under control then I’ll be off of everything. Takes a lot more to get it down than just drugs unless you want to stay on drugs. If you make actual lifestyle changes like what you eat and how you exercise you can reverse your diabetes. But… you really have to be committed it’s a no joke change and it is difficult-but totally worth it. 🌸

7. u/hu_gnew [score=2, created=2025-09-30T09:05:59]: I take my Metformin after my veggie starter and before the rest of the meal, this seems to keep the gastro chaos to a minimum. I may not be as sensitive as others but I did notice an improvement doing it this way.
8. u/LagerBoi [score=1, created=2025-09-30T04:42:43]: I couldn't do normal or extended release either. After about 6 months of straight up refusing to take my medication I managed to bully my doc into putting me on something else... Currently on one Alogliptin and half a gliclazide in the morning with breakfast, then half a gliclazide with dinner. Absolutely no issues. Maybe try specifically asking for that as you've heard that helps.
9. u/humanoid6938 [score=1, created=2025-09-30T02:47:49]: Ask for the extended release. Insist upon it. There's no need to suffer like this. It really helps.
10. u/Sayoayo [score=1, created=2025-09-29T19:34:37]: It lasted for about 5 days for me and I thought I couldn't continue with it. But the 6th day, I didn't have battery acid coming out of me, and the nausea subsided. It's been 3 months now and I have only had 1 other issue because I took it before eating. I've seen plenty of both sides- it wears off or it just doesn't work for them, but that is my experience so far!
11. u/Lands_hark [score=0, created=2025-09-29T18:13:55]: I took metformin years ago and it was debilitating. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain. I will never take it again.
12. u/ReddHottSc [score=1, created=2025-09-29T16:52:48]: I was taking Jordans but it would give me horrible yeast infections so now I am on Metformin er. I take one in the morning and one before I go to bed. I have never experienced diarrhea since I have been taking it.
13. u/PrudentMeat997 [score=1, created=2025-09-29T15:01:20]: I take metformin after I eat blood sugars always between 5-8 have to watch what I eat but generally over sustained period of time never over. Have never had issue with metformin. Sorry for your troubles. Also took jardience was very good. Lost prob too much weight with that and metformin. Dropped to 80kg now steady between 85-88
14. u/Fishby [score=2, created=2025-09-29T11:20:58]: I had such bad diahrea my file is marked never to have Metformin again. I want to try it again as it was the only medication I lost weight on and have kept it off for years.
15. u/miss_suzka [score=1, created=2025-09-29T09:49:53]: I take my Metformin ~30mins before eating. IDK if that helps, but I never experience nausea or diarrhea.
16. u/ExternalScale8119 [score=0, created=2025-09-29T09:22:45]: It's the fillers in the pills that cause diarrhea. I can take Sandoz, but not Medical Valley. It varies a bit from person to person.
17. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=2, created=2025-09-29T09:19:38]: Never take pills before laying down. You should be taking that with your dinner.
18. u/moriath1 [score=1, created=2025-09-29T09:16:05]: Made me feel rubbish both the normal and slow release. So stopped taking them. Due a review shortly. But afaik there are other things they can do to help if they really want.
19. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=3, created=2025-09-29T08:46:25]: I took jardiance when metformin didn't work it was great!
