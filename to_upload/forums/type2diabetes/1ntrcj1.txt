===============================================================================

First post. My husband has Type 2 Diabetes and I'm struggling with preparing meals that he will actually eat and not complain about. He's 60 and I'm 59, and were both originally from an Appalachian region, so we're both used to fried potatoes, fried chicken, cornbread, mashed potatoes and gravy, etc. It would be helpful for me if we would meet with a dietician so I would better understand how to cook for him and how to grocery shop, but he's dragging his feet even though his doctor has referred him to one. He has been telling me that the dietician our doctor referred him to hasn't called him, so I messaged our doctor today and he gave me the name of the dietician he is sending him to, but my husband doesn't want to meet with this person, in office or through a televisit. He has **not** been recently diagnosed and is on his last medication before insulin but it's still a struggle. I threw out his Pop Tarts a couple weeks ago and got him Zero Sugar wafer cookies because he has a sweet tooth. And they are actually good! The serving size is three cookies. He'll eat 12 or 15. And he sneaks candy bars at work. Like I said, it's a constant battle. Anyway, I'm lost and have been looking at diabetes cookbooks for about a week and I think I might like either the Taste of Home Diabetes Cookbook or the ATK Diabetes Cookbook. I'm leaning towards the Taste of Home cookbook since it was published last year and the ATK cookbook is older, but I'm not sure. Anyone use either of these cookbooks? Also, any advice for feeding a diabetic hillbilly would be greatly appreciated.

3. u/deacc [score=3, created=2025-09-30T06:31:05]: You can use diabetes food hub to look for recipes. And honestly, you can only do so much. It is up to him to take control of his diet. But I am sorry, sneaking candy bars at work is NOT OK.

They were all totally useless and high carb. Instead I found a way to modify the foods I liked to meet my diabetes goals. &gt;The serving size is three cookies. He'll eat 12 or 15. And he sneaks candy bars at work. Portion size and discipline matter, he has to learn some control or he will suffer the nasty complications. I am now 78 and still have no diabetes complications although age has caught up in others ways such as the big C, but I'm still alive and kicking. I know he is not brand new but he might find the ideas here useful: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html) This will help you as a guide for meal preparation until he knows more: [What to Eat at First](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2008/05/what-to-eat-until-you-get-your-meter.html)

If you are more into FB, there are probably many groups that can offer diabetic friendly recipes taking into the account what you eat on a regular basis. Often turning something from high-carb, high-fat to something more reasonable can be done easily. I've found eating a traditional SE Asian diet (my ancestry) is not good for my diabetes as it's usually high in carbs. I still eat fried foods - but more like a treat if I've kept my daily carb count low so maybe once per month. But baking potatoes, and chicken in an air fryer gives it *almost* a fried taste. You can find lots of tricks online on giving foods that *crunch* that is soooo satisfying! I know the coatings on chicken add a lot of carbs but if you can keep your daily carbs on the low end (say less than 100g or even 125g) and higher on protein he'll feel satisfied and not hangry. All the best!

If you eat greens first, then protein and then your starch and then walk for two minutes after eating you will reduce your sugar spike. Sounds crazy but it's science-based and sound. Don't cut out starch completely just cut it way down and ease him into it. If he eats three cookies after a meal then it's not so bad. Remind him that he can go blind and lose his feet if he doesn't dial back a little.
