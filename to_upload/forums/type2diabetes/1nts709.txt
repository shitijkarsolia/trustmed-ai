As the title suggests what are the best fruits/veggies without increasing blood sugar? I’m newly diagnosed so some advice would be great. Just trying to get more fibre in. Thanks in advance

Broccoli, I roast it, onions and peppers roasted. Hero breads and bagels, high fiber low carb. They make great pasta also. Chia seeds also high fiber. Test everything, give your body about 90 min to process the food. Walk, walk, and walk some more. Be determined to not let this get you down. It takes perseverance. 🌸

I found bananas made my bs shoot up quite a bit. Haven't tried apples or pears yet and I'm waiting for mango season For veggies I'm sticking with lettuce and rocket, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery ; zucchini, shredded carrots and capsicum with avos for good fats. ( it's salad season here in Australia)

As for veggies, go for non-starchy veggies. Leafy greens such as collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens and kale are good choices. Broccoli and cauliflower also good. I also throw snow peas in the mix because I like them. For now (I am only 2.5 months in as a T2) I am staying away from all starchy vegetables.

5. u/Spinalstreamer407 [score=2, created=2025-09-29T22:59:51]: I have cruciferous vegetables occasionally and celery sticks with no sugar added peanut butter. Good luck on your journey.
6. u/nico_see [score=2, created=2025-09-29T22:41:30]: At least for me, strawberries are my friend. Relatively low in carbs, and they keep me regular 🤷🏻‍♂️

8. u/PacRimRod [score=2, created=2025-09-29T17:38:07]: Non Starchy veggies like Cruciferous Veggies, and green leafy veggies.
9. u/mythicaliz [score=3, created=2025-09-29T15:41:57]: The biggest thing is just to make sure you're eating carbs with protein. I eat potatoes carrots corn etc without issue. I'm not a big fruit person in general but I eat apples and berries paired with sugar free peanut butter or Greek yogurt.
10. u/luna_nabi [score=5, created=2025-09-29T13:24:23]: I eat a lot of boy choy, spinach, cabbage, radishes (boiled reminds me of potatoes), spaghetti squash, Butternut squash, cauliflower, broccoli (prefer baby broccoli aka brocolini), edamame, portobello mushrooms, romaine lettuce, zucchini, asparagus (in moderation), brussels sprouts, cucumbers, and seaweed. For fruits, tomatoes, avocados, lemons, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and olives. Depending on how your body reacts, you might be able to have small amounts of kiwi, cherries, apples, peaches, and oranges, but I just stick to berries.
11. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=3, created=2025-09-29T13:11:19]: Tried to post my list here, but wasn't able to. However I've posted one over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1ntsl1c/random\_madness\_low\_carb\_fruits\_and\_vegetables/](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1ntsl1c/random_madness_low_carb_fruits_and_vegetables/)
12. u/vape-o [score=2, created=2025-09-29T13:10:25]: Raw carrots or celery. Cooking the carrots breaks down the vegetable and you’ll have higher blood glucose effect.
13. u/Ok_Tomorrow_7065 [score=4, created=2025-09-29T13:10:20]: If you look at what the glycemic index of foods is you should find the list of fruits and vegetables classified in ascending order. For example, bad fruits for a diabetic, cherries and grapes. Good fruits strawberry or blueberries. Good research to you
