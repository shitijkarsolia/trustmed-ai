Hey All - So a [short while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1nndyhf/highs_exercise/), I posted about my glucose spiking during exercise. This weekend, I went out again: Total ride was 37.54km * Duration 3:04:01 * Average Speed 12.1 km/h * Max Speed 22.3 km/h * Average Pace 4:54 min/km Did a few things differently. As I IF 16:8, this week my fast broke as I was going out. So I had overnight oats + chia seeds soaked in skim milk. I took my medication, including rapid acting insulin and set out. So it started high, which I expected but over the next few hours stabilized. Along the way, I also had an apple, plus two protein bars. The only thing I can think of, after asking one of my friends who is a pharmacist big on understanding diet/nutrition as it relates to diabetes is that the combination of overnight oats + chia seeds soaked in skim milk gave me a steady glucose release versus sharp spike. Also during the ride, the apple which is simple sugars gets taken up by the muscles to no significant rise plus the protein bars are high in fibre and protein so a more gradual absorption. I also took insulin before I went, which probably helped blunt the sharp increase. But also, as a few other suggested since I was fasting and muscles needed energy my liver released the stored glucose and I feel it overshot... but can't do much about that. The adrenaline + cortisol also helped elevate my blood glucose and finally no additional insulin to moderate things. Lesson learned - don't participate in exercise which is going to push you without fueling yourself first. Just wanted to share this with others who may run into issues... https://preview.redd.it/3fvedvex06sf1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdef7291bedd21efc8f4b312e655826383b3e54f
