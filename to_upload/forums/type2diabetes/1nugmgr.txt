===============================================================================

Hello all! Fellow T2 here. I had a question in regard to many posts that I’ve seen. If this comes off as insensitive, I promise I don’t mean it to be. And I am sorry if it’s a stupid curiosity. I am simply wondering how this disease affects different folks: I’ve read a lot about people “ignoring” their diabetes after diagnosis. I suppose my question is: if you are someone who ignored this, and I wouldn’t f*ckin blame you, how did you manage with the swings? Did you not feel terrible? Nauseous? Faint? I might be misunderstanding what people mean when they say they ignored theirs. But even when I try to do my best with my sugars, I still feel even the most moderate dips and jumps. Thank you!

Also reason why many with an undiagnosed T2 can actually go around for years without even noticing as such, as if anything should be amiss. But the longer term consequences will come though, often tough not until many years later but then the damage is done... Compared to T1, then T2s do typically still produce quite a lot of insulin from their pancreas, also reason why the DKA situation is actually quite much more rare even in T2 patients that do not comply with treatment directions to lower their BG. While with a run-away T1, that would come to a hard stop with DKA manifesting itself within just some days if not taking any insulin at all.

After reading Reddit people Being hospitalized at 15 it was a wake up call. Since I was diagnosed, I am on Mounjarro, And a thyroid pill. I Have not had any sugar or sugar by Product products, other than Stevia or Monk fruit since June. My doctor told me to eat under 40 carbs a day. I don’t eat anything white sugar, potatoes pasta. In 90 days, my A1c is now 7.6. Yeah, I took it seriously, after being an ostrich for so long. I can’t tell you how much better I feel. I found great substitutes for bread and pasta that I don’t feel deprived. Good luck.
3. u/Spindymindy8843 [score=3, created=2025-10-01T04:04:00]: I can only speak for myself. My job is physically demanding and I eat small portions regularly. So I don’t get any huge swings or changes in my levels. My fasting levels are the problem. I’m also just barely T2 aka a1c is currently pre diabetic and I was previously just enough to diagnose as diabetic. My diagnosis stems from my gestational diabetes I had with every pregnancy and my weight. And also all my family members have it. Am I right to ignore it for days at a time? No
4. u/Mimi-The-Minx [score=3, created=2025-09-30T20:15:41]: I'm trying not to ignore mine as I'm scared of losing my eye sight &amp; limbs. I have the opposite of wanting to eat, I struggle to force myself so I can take my medication twice a day as you have to eat . Its pretty rough &amp; after all the years of being tested &amp; always being given the all clear to find myself @ 57 now having to change mylife style even more.. I had always struggled with my weight but ate healthy &amp; exercised. The depression hit me big time, I felt like giving up especially when it comes to shopping for food, having to put things back bc they are just a big no no &amp; looking &amp; saying no can't eat that its not worth the sugar spike. The lows are bloody horrible &amp; the highs are just as bad the medication causing GI upset despite being on the slow release 1s is a right pain . Its been 7 mths now &amp; I know that sleep is important, cutting the stress, keeping an eye on my feet,watching for signs of infections getting my weight down I've lost 72 lbs &amp; keeping my fingers crossed that my AC1 level will be down when I go for my check So Diabetes sucks thats for sure.

The cardiac ICU said if I hadn't made him come in, he would have died. He fights for his vision, eyeball shots every 6 weeks. His brother is missing most of his feet. They both take it seriously, and are doing well now. They are my motivation to do better.
6. u/Ischarde [score=9, created=2025-09-30T18:03:47]: As someone who has come to rue ignoring their diabetes for long stretches of time, I don't recommend it. I have kidney disease, retinopathy (I get shots for that, every 3 months, and it's not fun), heart issues, some times wounds that heal slowly. It's hard tho. I get burnt out on taking care of myself. I get tired of multiple daily shots of insulin. I get tired of miscalculating a bolus and end up too low or too high. And yes I feel both of those conditions. This disease just flat out sux.
7. u/AntGroundbreaking102 [score=2, created=2025-09-30T16:17:03]: in my case, i’m not 100% certain i even have it. there are so many other diagnosis that mimics diabetes that my doctors won’t even entertain. i mean, no matter what i do, my sugar won’t go down. i’ve literally starved myself. i’m at the max for medications. nothing works. i don’t have any symptoms of high blood sugar. i never have. i don’t even know what prompted my doctor to order the bloodwork since i never had bloodwork in the past. i gave up. it’s easier to just ignore than to ruin my life. i’m only 32. i refuse to live like this for the rest of my life.
8. u/Phogoff [score=4, created=2025-09-30T15:33:26]: Ignoring it just leads to a very slow and painful death.
9. u/jadenkayk [score=4, created=2025-09-30T14:58:01]: When I say I ignored my diabetes I mean I ate food I wasn't supposed to and didn't exercise and just fell off the horse entirely with it. I started drinking soda and eating fast food and not watching my fiber intake or carb intake and just generally eating whatever I wanted. And I did that because it was more of a mental battle than it was a physical battle. Meaning I was going through some things in life and was dealing with depression and my diabetes was not my main focus at that time. Now I've gotten out of my depression for the moment and I'm able to focus more energy on my diabetes, but when I ignore my diabetes it's only for a few weeks or a few months at a time but it hasn't gotten to the point of affecting my vision or kidneys etc. I know I need to pay more attention to my diabetes and I know I need to do better about managing it, but I feel like it's very much a roller coaster of up and down with having the energy and the mental space to always want to handle everything that comes along with being diabetic.
10. u/Godhasyourback [score=3, created=2025-09-30T13:29:50]: In my case, it was poorly explained to me what the consequences of ignoring could be. I continued to ignore, and now I'm losing my eyesight and possibly looking at my kidney functions starting to suffer. Given how bad my eyes are, the likelihood that my kidneys are suffering pretty bad is pretty high up there. You think something as simple as sugar wouldn't be so bad but here we are.
11. u/moronmonday526 [score=7, created=2025-09-30T12:41:00]: I watched my Dad suffer the ravages of Type 2 for years, yet I continued to eat and live like crap. I requested an A1c one year, but it came back fine. Six years later, I fell quite ill rather suddenly. I lost 40 lbs in six weeks and was peeing throughout the day. I was traveling for work and finally got so sick I had to miss a flight. I saw my PCP and my blood sugar was 425. I went back the next morning for a full workup and my A1c was 13.4. He put me on Metformin and told me to eat better. All I did was replace regular soda with diet. Nothing else for the next eight years. I got my A1c down into the 7s. During the pandemic, I started to get an inkling that I should change my life. I finally learned how to cook (using an Instant Pot, but still) and started trying what were purported to be healthy recipes. I thought my numbers would improve but my depression and Metformin dosage only kept going up. About 18 months ago, my PCP connected me with a nutritionist who suggested some real changes. I made a few of them. Four months after that, I requested a CGM. I spent the next two weeks figuring out what I should and should not eat. Then, a family emergency separated me from my meds for a week. I was surprised that my numbers looked great the entire time. When I got back to my meds, I told myself I can do it, and I never restarted them. Five months later, my A1c came down from 6.8 on maximum medication to 5.8 on no meds at all. When my PCP said, "Maybe we can now start talking about possibly lowering your meds," I replied, "Good. I stopped taking them five months ago." She was shocked by my announcement but agreed that my numbers supported my decision. So yeah. I ignored my condition for eight years, but all it took was about six months of a concerted effort to get things under control and get off my meds.
12. u/Lopsided_Maybe5040 [score=1, created=2025-09-30T11:44:00]: Usually gone after 3 days or so. I had to find new ways to combat stress. Hard but doable. First step, listen to your provider to start. As you get the hang of it, you can do a deep dive, into things like Keto, fasting at all that.
13. u/Gottagetanediton [score=4, created=2025-09-30T10:13:40]: It feels terrible yeah but often it’s general malaise that it’s difficult to immediately link back to t2. Ignoring it can be from the shock of diagnosis or other mental health issues.
