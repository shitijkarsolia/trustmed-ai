===============================================================================

I (53 male 6 ft 2 202 pounds) am wondering how many of you, if any, have eliminated Dawn phenomenon after significant weight loss. The mornings are easily the only time my bg is a struggle. I don’t eat breakfast, but my 8:00 am reading is always the highest of the day. I have tried breakfast, snacks, late night snacks. Nothing changes it. As I wake it starts climbing and peaks at 8:00 (if I wake at 6:00.). It then slowly walks down until lunch. Lunch gives me a normal roundish spike, and drops quickly. Normal bg till dinner. Normal spike after dinner. Within an hour I am back to normal bg. Under 100 during the night. And then the dawn. That is all according to my CGM. I have lost about 15 pounds since August. I weigh my food. I eat less than 50 grams of carbs every day (weighed with a food scale.) Lots of protein and good fats. As much veggies as I can stand. I rotate through 5 meals, none of which cause a spike. (Boring I know.)I lift weighs and do cardio. I average 30,000 steps a day. I run daily. I’ve done just about all I can with diet and exercise. There is nothing left to tweet there. I have about 20ish pounds to loss around my stomach. Visceral fat. In your experience does dawn phenomenon decrease as I get rid of fat in and around my liver and reduce insulin resistance? My a1c was 8.5 in July and 6.1 a few days ago. I can maintain my current eating and pace for a few more months to lose this fat. But will it change anything? Or is it unique to the individual?

I did find that losing weight made a noticeable difference in this reading. You might consider getting a CGM device. I used one for a two week stint and was able to see the patterns emerge.
2. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=3, created=2025-10-01T05:10:45]: I've had to lose a lot of weight and still have about forty to go before I get to my goal weight. I've noticed a few things involving my numbers as I've lost the weight. It seems every time I am about to lose a few pounds my number get slightly wonky and elevated but not by very much. It could be a coincidence. My dawn phenomenon always starts around 4am and only when I get out of bed. At first I would hit 130 or so for a short time and by noon or later I'd be at baseline. Over time and this past month, I am under 100 by 8am in the morning or earlier and my rise might only be as high as the 110's and for a very short time until it starts to creep down. That is not to say that I don't have a morning where it's higher and takes a bit longer to get to baseline. This all still depends on what I eat for dinner and and how late, but on average I'd say it still much improved since my diagnosis. I credit losing the weight more than anything in reversing my numbers. No meds and and A1C been holding steady in the low 5s (6.9 at diagnosis and for only a short time) for almost a year now. Last A1C 5.0.
3. u/Putertutor [score=2, created=2025-09-30T17:47:48]: I seem to suffer from dawn phenomenon and what they call "feet on the floor" syndrome. My levels start to rise around 6:00 am and continue to rise, even if I don't eat anything right away. Then when I finally do eat something, the numbers climb even higher and don't start coming down until about 2 hours after I have eaten. Then the numbers continue to drop throughout the afternoon and are usually in the 110s by dinner time. My before dinner numbers are usually the best of the day. Better than my overnight numbers sometimes. I also have the visceral fat, so I assume that that part of it. I have given up trying to figure it out. My doctor doesn't seem to be worried about the morning fasting numbers, because my A1c numbers are pretty good.
4. u/TotalFNEclipse [score=2, created=2025-09-30T16:03:06]: Your post description sounds a lot like my personal struggle. From the eating to the exercising. And I can not under any circumstances seem to lose the diabetic bell (visceral). I’m exhausted. Has anyone had luck?
5. u/RandomThyme [score=2, created=2025-09-30T12:41:59]: Have you tried eating breakfast? My sugar will generally keep rising in the morning until I eat something.
6. u/Skyzfallin [score=1, created=2025-09-30T12:25:31]: With Mounjaro! Prior to that, 1 meal a day, low carb, lift weights, dawn phenomenon every day. After 1st jab, dawn phenomenon gone.
7. u/kayaker____4life [score=3, created=2025-09-30T11:40:02]: If i didn't have dawn phenomenon I don't think I would technically have diabetes.
8. u/slitherkime [score=1, created=2025-09-30T11:05:06]: I took insulin when I went to bed and it seemed to cure it. My morning BSG was very low sometimes (70-90) and left me shaky and nauseous but it’s even out now. I don’t take insulin anymore and my morning BSG is 110-130 mostly.
9. u/Infinite-Lychee-182 [score=1, created=2025-09-30T10:13:16]: Are you drinking coffee in the morning? Even with zero sugar creamer and sugar substitutes, it spikes my blood sugar an insane amount, even decaf.
10. u/JustKimNotKimberly [score=2, created=2025-09-30T10:07:45]: My only solution was an insulin pump. :-/
11. u/rckblykitn14 [score=1, created=2025-09-30T09:30:54]: I thought I did a few months ago, but it's back! Not as bad as it was, but it fluctuates all the time. Drives me nuts. I try to just ignore it honestly, and pay more attention to the overall 3 month number.
12. u/PacRimRod [score=1, created=2025-09-30T09:23:01]: For me it just took about about 3 months of clean living and sticking to a consistent IF schedule, 2 meals 1 snack between 12pm and 8pm.
