===============================================================================

My sugar craving has never gone away. It's been around 18 months. At this point I'm thinking it probably never will. Every day is hard. Every day requires regular, routine acts of will. I'm constantly surrounded by sugar and carbs. I drive to work, and it's just fast food everywhere. Vending machines full of chips and soda. Donuts in the break room. I took my kid to a 3rd grade birthday party and it was just cake, and soda, and Capri Suns... Everybody was gorging on sugar like it was nothing. Sometimes it feels like the whole world is made of sugar, and I can't have any. I count my carbs. I pick lower glycemic index stuff. I take my metformin. I've increased my exercise. I'm doing the right stuff, I think. But it somehow never "feels" easier. Every day feels like effort.

If I have lost it due to flours and chocolates, I suppose it is because my menopause has settled and I don't have peaks. But I suffer a lot watching my favorite desserts eat. And I'm not a very sweet person, which is even harder. I suppose that these episodes do not help my emotional condition and I have to go somewhere else or not attend depending on which meetings so as not to suffer. It makes me want to cry. So my social life is also affected. Not being able to have even a glass of white wine at a meeting or party and being eternally stuck with the bottle of water...
2. u/ValkyrieSteed [score=0, created=2025-10-02T16:27:16]: I felt this, dude. Before diagnosis, I had a binge eating disorder. Sugar was my friend. I figured after my diagnosis sunk in, I’d regret my benders more. And there’s still time for that. But I don’t right now. I miss it and the only reason I don’t go back is because I know that my future self will suffer for it. That being said, life goes on. It can’t stop because the world is made of sugar. Treat yourself to something else. Call into work and take a day to yourself. Start a new project. Go for a walk in nature if you can. Bring an audiobook for bonus points!

5. u/InformationForward39 [score=3, created=2025-10-01T09:19:41]: Sugar cravings are tough. This month, I'm going to be doing a no-starch/no-sugar challenge. I've done it before and I think it helped. For sweet treats, I'll make low-carb/keto friendly versions. and will stick to foods on this food list.

7. u/ioannisthemistocles [score=5, created=2025-09-30T20:25:26]: I'm with you. About 2 weeks ago I started using a CGM. Then I saw the effect of a late night carb binge. I hit 350 (max that is measured) and stayed there all night. That terrified me. I'm sure I was in the 400's for many hours. In my opinion thats self-destructive. I have honestly been completely carb free for 11 days. Zero sugar, wheat, corn, or rice products. I feel fantastic. I don't feel any cravings. I'm also surrounded by carbs. Been fighting this for 6 years.
8. u/anneg1312 [score=2, created=2025-09-30T20:03:33]: That’s why you still have cravings. You’ve never hit nutritional ketosis which is what gets rid of cravings and starts restoring both insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility (being able to burn either fat and glucose for energy as opposed to relying solely on glucose). I did super low carb for a year and cravings went away I regained significant insulin sensitivity and can now handle more carbs without spilling like crazy. I’ve learned how to make low carb/keto treats like cookies, cupcakes, pizza and breads as I still like those things I just don’t crave them.
9. u/janenickson [score=3, created=2025-09-30T19:42:09]: 61F diagnosed a year ago w T2. Was on glipizide as metformin er was not an option, especially at work. Had an ultrasound of my liver, which was not good. My dr prescribed me mounjaro. Im on week one, 2m5 mg dose, and the difference in my brain is night and day. The cravings have subsided. I feel normal again.
10. u/alan_s [score=11, created=2025-09-30T18:20:45]: &gt;Sometimes it feels like the whole world is made of sugar, and I can't have any. Forget sugar. It is all about carbs and sugar is just another carb. I made a simple rule for myself for treats when I was newly diagnosed. I could eat whatever I liked whenever I liked but I ***must*** test one hour later. No meter = no treat. It did not take long for high numbers on my meter to make many of those treats look less delicious and more poisonous.
11. u/InternationalDuck190 [score=6, created=2025-09-30T17:55:24]: I'm right there with you on this. I feel like most of the time I can deal with it alright. But every now and then I get really bitter about it lol.
12. u/gardngnomebecca [score=6, created=2025-09-30T17:36:21]: I found that eating cheese when my sugar cravings are at their worst helps. Don’t know why but a sharp cheddar or manchego turns down that screaming in my brain that I must have sugar.
13. u/anneg1312 [score=2, created=2025-09-30T16:38:53]: How many carbs do you eat per day?
14. u/Whyallusrnames [score=4, created=2025-09-30T16:15:22]: I feel for you. I really do. I don’t have diabetes (husband does) but I have celiac disease. I often feel like the world is made of gluten. The gluten free options are usually no where near as good as the gluten filled goodness. I wish I knew some tips. I feel like it’s easier for me to not cave in to eating gluten because it makes me violently ill with effects lasting a month. At the same time I get no cheat days like my husband does and it feels so unfair sometimes lol.
15. u/Ischarde [score=1, created=2025-09-30T15:35:17]: I don't have much advice to give, it's taken me nearly 20 yrs to lessen the sugar cravings. I had to quit any sodas cold. I stick with water, and once in a while unsweetened tea. Chocolate is the hardest to let go of, but I finally have. Same with baked goods. But hard candy is still my downfall. And sometimes the craving is strong enough I'll eat a couple of glucose tabs, and those are gross, unless you are having hypoglycemia.
16. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=2, created=2025-09-30T15:14:29]: It’s a drag, man. Sometimes I feel “lucky” (lol) that I’m extremely gluten intolerant because it completely rules out most of the fun social kinds of sugar things people eat at gatherings. (Of course, it has its own set of problems.) My three favorite seems-like-sugar things these days are Royal brand sugar free gelatin (0g carbs), Skinny Dipped brand dark chocolate peanut butter cups (3g net carbs), and plain yogurt with sugar free syrups made for flavoring coffee. I thought maybe I was too impressed by the pb cups since I have limited options but my eat-anything partner swears they’re really good.
17. u/Downtown_Average_464 [score=2, created=2025-09-30T14:04:23]: I’m the same way, I don’t think the cravings will ever go away. I was just diagnosed type 2 a few weeks ago. I’m only at the start of my journey but I’ve found eating the sugar free jello has curbed cravings for candy and I found some zero sugar chocolate that’s sweetened with stevia leaf from the brand “Russell stouffer” I have yet to try them but they have some pecan turtle flavours and one that is a knockoff Reese’s peanut butter cup among others like mint chocolate and a chocolate coconut Edit: spelling mistake Russell Stover is correct spelling of the brand
