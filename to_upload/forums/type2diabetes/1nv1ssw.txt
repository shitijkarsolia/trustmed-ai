===============================================================================

Just wanted to share encouragement and be proud of myself for a minute. For context: 39F 5’8” 332 lbs (down from 355), diagnosed a year ago with A1C of 7. The difference between the past week (average BG 103) and the prior period (average BG 118) is I’ve been tracking food all day long again (instead of only through lunch like I tend to) and recently added a pedometer widget to my phone’s lock screen to help actually hit my step count goal (which is pretty modest). These averages are based mainly on AM testing and other readings taken 1.5-3 hours after meals. My last A1C a couple months ago was 6.1 but I’m hopeful it’ll be even lower next time :) Slow and steady and sustainable, right?
