===============================================================================

My blood sugar is pretty well-maintained this year (HbA1C around 5.0), so I plan to eat mindful(!!!) portions of traditional holiday foods I wouldn't normally eat on Thanksgiving and Christmas so I can enjoy the meals with everyone else. However, I would really like to be able to contribute a dish or two (whether an appetizer, a side, or a dessert) that is blood sugar friendly. I tried looking up recipes online, but they're looking a little dull. Does anyone have a diabetic friendly recipe they usually like to make? I'd love something that other guests would think tastes good too and doesn't really give off "too bland and healthy” in flavor.

Braised Onions 8 T. butter, melted 4 medium onions (about 4) peeled and cut into 1/4” slices 1 t. salt or to taste 1/2 t. nutmeg 3/4 c. grated parmesan cheese Melt butter in large saucepan or skillet. Add onions, cover tightly and cook on low heat about 25 minutes or until tender. Add salt and nutmeg, stir well. Just before serving, stir in Parmesan cheese. Serves 8. I also like to eat mashed cauliflower rather than mashed potatoes, and serve myself white barbecue sauce rather than gravy, so I don’t miss the stuffing. I also found a Keto pumpkin bread recipe that I like for dessert: https://greenandketo.com/keto-pumpkin-bread?fbclid=IwAR1HsmhQUlIUrpkzi7eze84HdwcSU-U-n6444-0X_0gKtRQ_pINzjpZbrmA

Line baking dish with parchment paper, pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Peel squash Cube (I cut then up into about 1/2 in cubes) Place in large mixing bowl Add olive oil (I eye everything but enough to coat all of the squash) Add salt, pepper, and either rosemary or oregano, basil, and parsley Optional: Add garlic powder, onion powder, and/or crushed red pepper Spread evenly on a lined baking sheet Bake in oven for 35 to 40 minutes Similarly, you can make burnt broccoli or charred Brussel sprouts this way. bake for 25 min at 425. (For Brussel sprouts, cut off stem and cut in half long ways before mixing in bowl with seasoning and oil). If you miss potatoes. You can make smashed red radish. I wash them, cut root, and then boil until you can pierce easily with fork. From there, you can just mix in a bowl with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, black pepper, and butter. Then smash with fork. If you prefer baking, you can cut them in half, mix with rosemary, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic. Place cut side face down on lined baking sheet. 425 for 20 min. Then flip radishes, cut side up, cook for another 15 to 20 min. Sprinkle with parmesan and then broil for 3 to 5 min on high. You could then carefully mix them in a bowl with sour cream. If you want meat, I would reserve sear one or two Tomahawk steaks.I would use fresh rosemary, fresh garlic, salt, pepper, and butter. Yummy!

Reasonable portion sizes, and go for a walk with the family afterwards. Edit to add- any vegetables with herbs and not a fatty cheese sauce would fall in the category you asked about, I love roasted acorn squash with different directions of flavors like pumpkin spice or a savory thing like sage and brown butter.
