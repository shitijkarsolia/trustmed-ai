Anyone try to the cauliflower pizza from pizza with non dairy cheese? Safe or a gimmick? I tried a slice it tasted good but I didnt check my levels after. The crust tasted like regular crust and I have a feeling it's mixed with regular flour. I dint think it's 100% cauliflower crust. It tasted too good to be healthy lol I recall eating a homemade cauliflower pizza from scratch and the cauliflower taste is noticeable.
