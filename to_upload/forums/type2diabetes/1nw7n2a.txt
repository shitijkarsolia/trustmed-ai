===============================================================================

So, we were packing to leave for our anniversary trip last weekend and I woke up to high numbers that did not go down. I don’t know if I was anxious about getting the kids to school in time, finishing up last minute things or my daughter getting sick before we were leaving but I’d had low carb the day before(chia seed pudding, chicken thighs and broccolini and steak and cabbage). My numbers would budge so I skipped breakfast and did a 10 mile bike ride— still nothing. I had a protein shake and said eff it because we needed to get on the road and look at those numbers after about 30 mins of driving, lol! It was stress. They kept dropping. Had to grab a salad. We gotta keep chill you guys.

If you dont mind sharing- whats your A1C and how long have you been a T2? I got diagnosed 2 years ago and my A1C was 6.8 - my most previous A1C was 6.1
