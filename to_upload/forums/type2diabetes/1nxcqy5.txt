===============================================================================

Looking for advice/opinions. Background: A week ago got steroid injections in my knees for arthritis. Started feeling horrible, checked my blood glucose, and it was 450. Went to the Emergency Room and they tested it at 503. They gave me some IV fluids, I drank a bunch of water, and it was down to 350 a couple hours later. I declined insulin as it was headed in the right direction and was sent home. My glucose has averaged 233 since then. On following up with my primary a week later, she said that the high level was odd, but that she wouldn't diagnose me with diabetes or order any tests to follow up, as my A1C in August was 5.9% (pre-diabetic). I've read the medical research on steroid shots and blood glucose, and the highest reading noted was 500 for a person who had uncontrolled diabetes. My question: Should I be pushing harder for some kind of followup?

The numbers are there.. My HbA1c is 5.4... And I'm diabetic. You ver checked your fasting BG? As I'm sensing that ain't gonna be great either. Mind you I hope none of it is true 😐

If you're not already making aggressive lifestyle changes or beginning interventions such as metformin, I would discuss that with your doctor.

I remember when a covering Doc didn’t read my file and prescribed me an antibiotic steroid and shit my sugar UP. I called my regular Doctor a couple of days later and told me to stop using it immediately.

7. u/TheJadedMonkey [score=2, created=2025-10-03T15:56:56]: Steroid injections will do that. They always Ness with my blood sugar. No doctor ever told me rhis and I just happened to mention a cortisone injection while at my endocrinologist and they told me about it.
