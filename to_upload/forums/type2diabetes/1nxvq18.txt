===============================================================================

Hello! I’m still in the fresh phase of “I gotta get my shit in gear and I’m scared I’m going to do something wrong.” I’m in the earliest stages of T2 and I want to set myself up for success. Doc says meds aren’t necessary for me at this point. That being said, My baseline was hovering between 85-90 for a good while. The main thing was, I wasn’t eating barely any carbs. I was told by my doctor that I have to incorporate more in order to stay healthy, which I agree with in terms of how I felt, so I went from &lt;50 a day to between 70-100 (I don’t think I have gone above 90 in months though to be honest) I do feel that I’m getting more nutrients now, however, my fasting and baseline have risen to 95-100. Here are my concerns: 1. Could this be the result of me incorporating more carbs into my diet? My body is definitely telling me that I need them, so I’m hesitant to go back to my meat-prominent diet. 2. I sleep like shit, and I’ve been told that can have adverse effects on blood sugar. Has this caused anyone’s fasting/base levels to increase? And if so, have you been able to fix it? Thank you! EDIT: I walk at least 8,000 steps a day (after breakfast, at work, and sometimes after dinner) and strength training 3x a week. I usually do not eat more than 30 carbs in one meal, and those I either get from veggies, yogurt, or protein powder

2. u/usafmd [score=-3, created=2025-10-04T13:34:01]: I really can’t understand your focus. If you’re in the early stages of T2 diabetes, then start losing weight and start exercising like your life depends upon it. What’s with just walking? I’d stop focusing around with glucose levels.
3. u/gertymoon [score=2, created=2025-10-04T09:59:14]: What type of carbs are you eating? Are they good ones or bad ones?
4. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=3, created=2025-10-04T09:54:49]: I have intermittent insomnia (mostly waking up in the middle of the night or too early in the morning vs not falling asleep at night) and it definitely makes a difference in my morning BG. When I sleep better, it’s lower, when I spend more time awake, it’s higher. I quit caffeine earlier this year and it’s been helping on top of also taking a higher dose of melatonin and all the other sleep hygiene standard stuff.
5. u/TheRealLougle [score=3, created=2025-10-04T09:34:11]: I found, for my body, less carbs is better. Not more. The transition was different but now I feel fantastic. I eat 0-5g of carbs per day and all of my diabetes labs have reversed to normal levels. My CGM is currently reading 72. 🤗
6. u/Wall-Live [score=1, created=2025-10-04T08:10:05]: My 2cents. If your A1C is solid then I’d not worry about it. This need would need more bloodwork. How do you know your body meeds carbs? What kind of carbs? How much seed oils and proceed food are you eating? What’s your fasting insulin?
7. u/GriffTheMiffed [score=3, created=2025-10-04T07:48:02]: How closely are you tracking your food? Just saying "no more than 90 carbs" leaves out a lot of information. Let's assume you are saying grams of net carbs and that you are talking carbs from everything, not just carb heavy products. That amount is fine, I eat more than that but I also run 6/7 days a week. What does your exercise look like? Are you walking after meals? What's your a1c?
