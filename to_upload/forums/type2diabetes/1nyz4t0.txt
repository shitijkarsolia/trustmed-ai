Does anyone eat carbs? I’ve only been able to lower my sugars by cutting out almost all carbs. I eat vegetables and meats…nothing else and I don’t see it as being sustainable. Give me some ideas

Im using a cgm, so I've been able to experiment with everyday changes and tricks at restaurants too. Also it may be placebo, but I've read that introducing something sweet to your palate before a meal can kickstart metabolism and insulin production, so I've been using sweet drinks or bits of dark chocolate as appetizers with small but noticeable results.

My S.O. didn't even realize it wasn't rice with the chow mein. and we bought the frozen fried rice which is easy to cook.

I found Egglife wraps they do not taste like egg to get my sandwich and tortilla fix. I especially enjoy in the morning the cinnamon wrap. I toast it in the air fryer and it smells like cinnamon toast. I smear a bit of cream cheese and add some berries and it’s delicious. 2 wraps are a serving 60 calories and 3 Total carbs.

5. u/[deleted] [score=2, created=2025-10-07T06:49:13]: Funny did my wife call you?! We just had this argument yesterday. I don’t think I eat a lot of Carbs as she suggests. I’m also active cut out garbage and really only eat like 2X a day. I eat a ton of veggies and protein and my BS has been very manageable. I actually got tested to get my DOT Card last Friday and literally just having the dangerous bagel for breakfast and doing literally almost nothing all day came in at 144. And that’s not to shabby at all. I spoke to the PA and when she worked in the ER and hospitals she saw BS in the High 400’s and 500’s!!!! So can I try and probably cut out some more of course. But with what I’m doing the meds (that’s for another post) all is going well. Everything in moderation! And remember what my doctor said. You can eat what you want but make sure you do physical activity to help burn it off!

8. u/Academic_Carpet9452 [score=3, created=2025-10-06T16:53:00]: Yea I eat carbs. 💥 I don't go out of my way to eat them but if I'm feeling for something with carbs I'll eat it. My spikes and return to base have always been pretty normal in range. I'm a diabetic and I treat myself that way..but I'm still trying to understand why I have so much freedom with food not even 4 months since diagnosis.
9. u/AFC_Darko [score=3, created=2025-10-06T12:34:38]: I eat carbs. I’m not as severe as many others here. It’s about balance. Now, my diabetes is not bad, and my A1C has been at 5.0% for a long time so I’m well-managed (aka eating some taters and cookies here and there isn’t doing much, I barely spike anymore). The main thing for me is really about two things: the KIND of carbs I’m consuming and WHEN I consume them. Not all carbs are equal. I try to get lots of fibres and good quality carbs that won’t just spike me up or bloat me without benefits. Instead of white bread, I go for sourdough. Instead of white pasta, I go for brown rice-based pasta (which contains tons of fiber and is gluten-free), etc. Complex carbs will do more for you than processed bleached crap. Of course it’s all about balance. I find what helps to reduce my hunger before a meal is to get some fibers in FIRST, either chugging Metamucil if I’m lazy, or chomping on a bunch of veggies before my main plate. That way it just reduces the amount of carbs I’m even capable of consuming. I like to eat carbs after physical activity, and in the morning when I know I won’t be eating much lunch at all during work. Then honestly, sometimes in the weekend I have family dinners or special events here and there and then I literally just eat whatever, in moderation. I’m chomping on real chocolate cake for my bday and that’s just how I choose to live my life.

11. u/ac7ss [score=3, created=2025-10-06T09:04:50]: I generally stay away from them, but I have the advantage that I can take insulin if I am going to have a carb meal. I will avoid added sugars as much as possible and make sure that the carbs are mostly dietary fiber. It doesn't stop me from having the occasional burger, but I try to not make it a habit. Meat, cheese, veg, That is my life for the most part.
12. u/always_learning2be [score=3, created=2025-10-06T08:08:44]: I’ve been T2 for 14 years. I initially lowered and controlled mine with diet. I used Jorge Cruise’s sugar carb ratio. I lost weight and got it under control, but it was not sustainable. Carbs were too low. I couldn’t even eat an apple. I finally saw a dietician a few years back, and she showed me the importance of carbs. I wasn’t eating near enough. I’m on mounjaro right now because I couldn’t keep my A1C from climbing, but I’m still working on that carb ratio. Eating the right kind and right amount of carbs is an important key. No carbs is not the answer. I highly recommend seeing a dietician. That helped me more than any doctor or meds has.
13. u/sstole19 [score=3, created=2025-10-06T05:27:13]: I eat carbs. When I first got diagnosed my PCP said to cut out all carbs and I did for 2 months. Lost about 15 lb in those 2 months and then I got a dietitian who told me I needed to be eating fibrous carbs. I tried to balance them out. I know I need to limit my non-fibrous carbs because I like them a lot but they are not good for me. I just need to eat more vegetables and have more fiber and more protein because I don't eat protein to save my life. It's hard.
14. u/Salty_Activity8373 [score=3, created=2025-10-05T22:57:36]: I eat like I did before the diagnosis. I am on Ozempic though and have lost 80 pounds. Carbs don't really bother me.
15. u/The_Real_Nerol [score=2, created=2025-10-05T21:28:41]: I do! I've been limiting them more since I've gotten pregnant and am trying to avoid insulin (my A1C is 5.1 currently and I have 9-10 weeks left). When I'm not pregnant, my A1C is 5.4 and I don't limit carbs at all as it's not sustainable for me. I do practice moderation, but otherwise if I want some pizza, I'll have some pizza, you know?
16. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=0, created=2025-10-05T21:07:40]: I do. My dinner today was baked chicken, 250g of mixed vegetables (steamed) and 1 1/2 sweet potato. The mixed vegetables has 33g of carbs (8g sugars) but 11g of fibre and 7g of protein. The sweet potato had 27g of carbs, 8.4g sugars and 4.3g of fibre. Outside of healthy carbs, I will have pizza, burgers or french fries. I just try to pair with a lot of protein. I enjoy samosas and had one today, 30g of carbs and only 1g of fibre.
17. u/PacRimRod [score=5, created=2025-10-05T18:22:03]: Very, very minimal carbs. Just the carbs naturally occurring in non starchy veggies. It's clean keto, it's for me and is very sustainable to/for me. Make a plan with your doctor and nutritionist, see what will work for you in the long run. This is a life long process for us!
18. u/mxa11944 [score=0, created=2025-10-05T17:57:40]: I do.
19. u/catsandplants424 [score=7, created=2025-10-05T17:09:45]: I've been doing it for 5 years with cheat meals. You need to be able to have control to do it though. Take Thanksgiving, since it's close, you have mostly turkey and veggies but you can also have a small portion of stuffing or mashed potatoes. Keep them small plan to take a walk 30 minutes or so after you eat. You just need to be smart about it and have a plan. Some are going to tell no you can't do this approach but to them I say you also need to live and be happy not constantly feel depressed and deprived.
20. u/KerryBoehm [score=3, created=2025-10-05T16:44:07]: If I have rice or cereal (All Bran) I’ll measure out half a cup and pair it with protein. Likewise I’ll eat a burger with the bun but only if it’s thick burger. Not McDonald’s where it is more bun tgan meat.
21. u/island_wide7 [score=2, created=2025-10-05T15:35:44]: I eat carbs. I don’t count but watch the quantities (ex.: half of sandwich and a half can of coke for lunch instead of two sandwiches and 2 cokes). My GLP1 does the rest of the work and keeps me in line
22. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=3, created=2025-10-05T15:09:41]: You need some carbs for energy. In the beginning, I allowed myself 50 g per day. I can safely go 75 ish now. Intermittent fasting 8/16 and three ten minute walks a day have me at 5.2 the walking should occur within an hour after eating and by the way, no snacking.
23. u/zoebud2011 [score=13, created=2025-10-05T14:54:53]: When I first started out, I limited my carbs to 30-40 a day for the same reason. Now I'm 16 months in, and I can do 60-80 with no issue. I can even have a bite of cake every now and then after a meal. It just takes time. I only take metformin 500mg 2x day. Nothing else. I lost 100 pounds too, which helped a lot.
