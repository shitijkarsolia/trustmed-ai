Hi All - I got diagnosed in 2023 - I had A1C of 6.8. I think I was probably diabetic at least 2 to 3 years prior to that. I quickly changed my diet and reduced my A1C to 5.8. I also started keto and lost around 70 lbs. But due to long working hours - I gained back 30 to 40 lbs. and my last A1C (April of this year was at 6.1) I don't see my work schedule decreasing any time soon. In fact - I think my life is about to get even more hectic. when I lost all that weight - I was not working at all. I was basically just working out and looking after my health. but I got in huge CC debt. I am thinking about doing GLP1 medicine like Zepbound and hopefully it will help me with the weight loss. I do a lot of stress eating - that's been my issue since I was a young kid. My question is with zepbound - how it will interfere with stressful work life? Will it make me more productive or less productive?

You need to have a close look at your food choices, whether at stressful times or just your ordinary menu. Use your meter or CGM to choose more wisely: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

Symptoms vary from person to person, but I don’t find its hindered my ability to work at all. I don’t get a ton of symptoms though and I’ve only done one dose of monjaro so far with very mild nausea. Next dose is tomorrow. If you’re doing ok on metformin then there is a good chance you’ll be ok on a glp1, but a probiotic yogurt (or something like plain kefir) might be beneficial to add to your morning breakfast routine. I don’t drink it as much anymore, but I was drinking about 8 oz of kefir a day to help with potential digestive issues at first.
