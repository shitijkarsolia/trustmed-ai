Are you on the right meds/inhaler? If you’re fully under control, and have a rescue inhaler at the ready, moderate exercise should be no problem. I can do a full hour workout, walk 10 miles, etc. with fully controlled asthma without complications

I went from a couch potato to running half-marathons once I got on one. As noted by another poster, start very slowly and build up gradually. Exercise can be fun and feel good, but it can also take a long time to see and feel results. Be patient and disciplined and you'll improve
