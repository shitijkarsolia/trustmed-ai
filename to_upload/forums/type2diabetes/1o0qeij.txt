===============================================================================

My A1C has been on a steady rise for several years. From 6.2 four years ago to 7.3 six months ago. Started on 1 tablet a day Metformmin 2 years ago. Increased to twice a day 6 months ago. Results from yesterday was 8.2. Diet, I thought was better - certainly no worse. Definetly less alcohol. Kinda depressing. I'm 65, male, thin..6ft 4,195 pounds. I don't get it.

2. u/Potential-Ostrich862 [score=2, created=2025-10-08T21:28:20]: I'm seconding both dapagliflozin and a CGM. They've been a game changer for me. Just make sure if you're on dapagliflozin to drink lots of water.
3. u/RetiredToExplore [score=2, created=2025-10-08T09:45:42]: Being thin, you likely have a different disease process than the usual type 2. Agree with other comments about CGM to find out what is bumping your blood sugar, learning about monitoring carbs and especially fast vs slow carbs (glycemic index). But in the end your diabetes may progress and require more medication and it isn't your fault!!
4. u/RidgeConnection [score=2, created=2025-10-08T00:45:00]: Perhaps ask your Dr to consider adding an SGLT2 like Farxiga or Jardiance. Also try to get your hands on a CGM like Dexcom or Libre
5. u/YorkieN [score=1, created=2025-10-07T16:25:02]: There are other meds you can add in, I have started dapagliflozin which are meds which help you lose excess glucose through your urine. Mounjaro would be my last option given the side effects possible, such as sudden and irreversible blindness!
6. u/Romaine2k [score=4, created=2025-10-07T16:19:36]: Get a CGM, there’s no point in guessing what the culprit is, it could be anything.
7. u/deacc [score=1, created=2025-10-07T16:14:10]: Aside from less alcohol, what other measures have you taken on your diet? What about exercise?
8. u/Professional_Tip_867 [score=1, created=2025-10-07T16:12:46]: tell us what you eat in a typical day. might be your body, might be your diet,
9. u/hu_gnew [score=5, created=2025-10-07T15:54:37]: I'm similar to you, 67 yo 6'4"/200, prescribed 500mg x2 Metformin though I only take one dose a couple times a week or so. I'm well controlled at 5.8. My question is: how many grams of carbs do you consume in a day? I think that being very mindful about carbs is the most powerful tool I have to control my diabetes, I even use a kitchen scale to weigh out portions of carb loaded foods. Right now I'm at about 130 grams a day after being as low as 60 early in my Dx. I don't bother tracking how much protein or fat I eat, as long as I keep the carbs low my medicine is able to keep up. My situation is unique, offered in case someone finds it useful.

11. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=6, created=2025-10-07T15:15:59]: Medication is not a solution, but just one tool that you can use to help get those numbers down. Even if you're not trying to lose weight, use an APP to track what you're eating and you will soon find all the "hidden" carbs.
12. u/mynameisdbabz [score=3, created=2025-10-07T14:15:29]: alcohol strangely enough lowers sugar for me and alot of people , carbs carbs carbs man
13. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=1, created=2025-10-07T14:05:29]: You might need a higher dose, or to add another medication, your doctor should be able to help with that. I’m on two 500mg metformin 2x per day, but didn’t see a big difference until I started monjauro. Do you test your blood sugar every day? I do it once in the morning and two hours after every meal to see how different foods affect it. I don’t use insulin but do find it helpful to know what is actually going on instead of trying to guess.
