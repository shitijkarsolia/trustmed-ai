===============================================================================

I’m back again. Wow do I suck at this! So now I’m having an issue where even when I don’t eat very much or stick to things like apples and protein bars, my numbers will still go high so that then if I actually eat a regular meal they shoot up. I seem to be shaky no matter what I do, and I’m afraid to eat anything/very much in case I have a spike. I’m not really sure how I should be managing this. I also have a cold right now - could that be contributing to the high numbers? Feeling kind of frustrated and also hangry all the time.

Tbh, the only reason I'm doing okay with managing my T1 and T2 diabetes is bc I ask allll the questions even if I think it's stupid. Like, I just had a similar conversation with my endocrinologist about my random ass spikes despite being good about counting carbs and adjusting if it's a carb heavy meal or a very light carb meal.

You may need an adjustment to your medications. Also, if you haven’t done it already, get your doctor to write you a prescription for diabetes education classes. insurance should cover it.
6. u/anneg1312 [score=5, created=2025-10-08T10:45:11]: Have you learned about counting carbs? What treatment are you on? Both apples and protein bars will spike almost every diabetic and should be on a “eat only RARELY” list. I stayed under 30g carbs for a year to bring my a1c and insulin resistance back into normal ranges. I ate plenty of great no and very low carb food.

The only fruit I eat are blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. I try to keep my carbs under 40 g a day. The only time I had a spike in the last four months was I ate oinkos triple protein, no sugar, vanilla yogurt, and I had mixed it with a scoop of flavored protein powder. The combo spiked my blood sugar over 200 even though the carb count was 11 g and 37 g of protein. Luckily, I had a CGM on so I knew the numbers.

Apples and protein bars WILL make you spike so it's not 'no matter what you do' that make you spike but poor food choices 😅 Yes they recommend to remove fruit from your diet once diagnosed and stick to apples and pears but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good for you. Most people can have apples.. I never could (I probably can now since I have reduced my insulin resistance). First of all apples fiber is in the skin, so if you removed that you only eat carbs and that ain't good. Secondly apples and fruit in general is better tolerated at the end of a meal rather than as a snack. Which I have the impression is how you eat apples. Protein bars (most) are too carb heavy for T2 and are better had with some fiber in the stomach already... Which defeat the purpose of having them bars in the first place so unless you find the good ones with little carbs best stay away from them or even better you could make your own Protein bars (plenty of receipes on line) at least you are certain they have no hidden carbs. For snacks if you really have to have fruit, berries are your best bet.. But I'd prefer a handful of nuts (peanuts are not really nuts) or cheese. Also check on line the glicemic index of the food you normally eat to have an idea, and see if alternatives are more suitable for you.

There are going to be times when you will do fantastic, everything seems to be working, your numbers go down to almost perfect. And then something happens, you get sick, eat something you didn't think would matter, and it all falls apart. Or like me, you burn out from watching everything that goes in your mouth, or get tired of shooting insulin every time you eat. It sounds like you are doing everything you can, and honestly, this is a good thing. It's mostly trial and error, figuring out what won't give you a spike. Don't beat yourself up over this.
10. u/chromedoutcortex [score=6, created=2025-10-07T21:28:46]: If you're in Canada/US check out the Kirkland brand protein bars. When I'm out, I find these very satisfying. High protein, moderate carbs and also has Fibre.
11. u/idtix [score=5, created=2025-10-07T18:56:15]: All the protein bars I've seen are usually really high in carbs. Check if your protein bars are low carb as well. Also what helps a spike in my experience is eating a bunch of veggies (non-starchy) first before you eat anything else.
12. u/StJmagistra [score=-2, created=2025-10-07T17:21:42]: An apple is all carbohydrates. Of course it’s going to spike your blood glucose. Why would you expect something different to happen?
13. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=8, created=2025-10-07T15:49:29]: If you don’t eat, you still need energy, so your liver is gonna dump gogo juice into your veins so you can live. You can’t stop eating, you can’t stop eating all carbs, try to evenly spaced them out during the day if you can.
