===============================================================================

Just got diagnosed and while I'm doing my best right now, I'm sure I'll have issues. Food was my favorite vice, specifically sugar and carbs. Does anyone have recommendations on replacements? I quick smoking in January and my brain is screaming that I can replace food with smoking lol. I know that there must be better options.

Above all else, don't prevent yourself from enjoying things as long as you keep it in moderation and make up for it with either upping protein/fiber or exercise. I still eat cake at birthdays and have the occasional ice cream or Gelato, I just have to plan for it.

Your meter or CGM can provide the best advice on which of your favourite foods are OK and the appropriate portion sizes: [Test, Review, Adjust](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/test-review-adjust.html)

Add chocolate to pan, take off heat, whizz with stick blender/ food processor for 1 min. Add a whole egg, whizz again for for 45 seconds. Add any flavouring you like, vanilla essence, orange zest, a shot of liqueur or leave as it is. Divide between 8 very small dishes like shot glasses or espresso cups. Fridge for 3 hours. This gives me a week of treats after dinner and is so good for you with the polyphenol in the choc. Smoothies are good too - blended frozen mixed berries, scoop white choc protein powder, milk.

So for sour cream, mayonnaise (I like hummus even better as a sub for this though!), regular yogurt. In general, my biggest vice is chocolate. I’ve found that 85% dark chocolate is fine in moderation and I like it melted and drizzled over fruit (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, apples). You can also pair that with chia seeds and or chopped pistachios and freeze for a type of bark. You could even layer that with some Greek yogurt! Do your best and take it a day at a time. Don’t get too frustrated with yourself and remember good habits take time to form. If you can ask your doctor for a referral to a diabetes education class which usually goes over nutrition and ask for a referral to a dietician. If your insurance covers it and it is something you’re interested in ozempic and monjaro really cut down on food noise and are great help with overall a1c.
