===============================================================================

I’m not looking for a diagnosis just trying to get a better understanding of people’s experiences. For background I have a family history of type 1 diabetes but am overweight. I get labs done frequently through my psychiatrist. In June my glucose levels were high but before that they’ve been fine. I’ve been eating a lot healthier since I got that result and have lost weight. Since Monday I’ve felt awful and the symptoms line up with diabetic symptoms. Did anyone go from being in a normal range to full type 2 diabetes in just a few months? I’ve tried googling timelines but most sites imply it develops slowly. Hearing anyone’s experience would be appreciated.

2. u/OutlandishnessOpen67 [score=2, created=2025-10-10T21:47:43]: I had a rapid onset response from Covid. I went from healthy to fully t2D in three months. This is my doctor’s best guess because we didn’t diagnose it for three years (height of the pandemic). My first A1C was 12.9. Two years later it’s 5.1 (medicated).
3. u/Affectionate_Taro876 [score=1, created=2025-10-10T10:49:41]: 20 years with the help of gestational diabetes, liver issues, and PCOS
4. u/lamefartriot [score=1, created=2025-10-10T10:05:08]: About two years (at least between tests, although symptoms started earlier). Had a completely normal test in 2023, and was diagnosed last month
5. u/alan_s [score=1, created=2025-10-09T15:16:00]: &gt;In June my glucose levels were high How high? Specific numbers please. What did your doctor say after seeing the numbers?
6. u/Professional_Tip_867 [score=1, created=2025-10-09T10:04:36]: 2 years from A1C of 6.2 to 6.9. so many factors , though. I was very active at the 6.2 time, less so at @ 6.9. under an incredible amount of stress at the latter time, as well. having said that, I had gestational diabetes, 25 year prior. so who really know the correct. time frame.
7. u/lukerocknuts [score=1, created=2025-10-09T09:02:00]: I’m 28 years old. I had a blood test in 2019 with an A1C of 5.5 (within normal). At the time I was on a keto diet for about 80% of the time. Well fast forward to 2025, eating everything and not exercising, just took a test yesterday and got a result of A1C 7.2 I’m very worried and am scrambling to turn my life around before the doctor prescribes meds.

9. u/Mimi-The-Minx [score=1, created=2025-10-09T04:59:36]: I have been regularly tested since my 20s bc of weight trouble &amp; all negative no signs of being pre diabetic only to find I am now type 2 @ the age of 57 back in March a routine blood test for something else flagged up a problem with my liver so the Dr requested I have a Diabetes Blood test done ..my Eldest Sister she was the same became diabetic in her early 50s &amp; have since found out a paternal Aunty was the same. I was told its probably bc I'm now postmenopausal &amp; so don't have estrogen protection anymore.. I have lost a lot of weight &amp; fingers crossed my next Blood level check will be lower than my 1st
10. u/drchickensoup [score=2, created=2025-10-09T03:55:16]: I developed it during pregnancy due to rapid weight gain, I didn't have it a month before I got pregnant and by 28 weeks pregnant I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and I've since been diagnosed with type 2.
11. u/Fun-Emu8286 [score=3, created=2025-10-09T02:24:57]: as other comments have mentioned, everyone's body / journey is different, but I was prediabetic in early 2021, I'd say I was diabetic by early to mid 2022. Didn't get another blood test or diagnosis until September 2024. That being said, I didn't understand (nor did I have anyone explain to me) the serious repercussions of being prediabetic. I wish I had of known and started making changes them. Good luck on your journey!
12. u/knubee [score=3, created=2025-10-08T22:09:18]: Every body is different like your literal *body* is built differently from everyone else’s. So timelines are meaningless but yes a few months is enough time for you to become diabetic. Especially since you have family history of t1d. Type 1 is different from type 2. If you’re worried about your symptoms m, Walmart sells glucometers for $30 OTC. You can check yourself over a few days to show the doctor for more advice. Or go to urgent care near you to get your serum glucose and a1c checked along with your observed symptoms. Also if you’re actively losing weight then your hormones can be a factor. Weight loss can affect hormones which in turn can affect your glucose/your body’s absorption of sugar for energy.
13. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-10-08T21:54:37]: I'm pretty sure I had T2D in my my 20's but was never diagnosed until I hit 35. The doctor said that most people (this was 25+ years ago) are usually diabetic for 5-10 years before they are officially diagnosed. Things are different now, so people are getting diagnosed sooner. I had many of the symptoms of T2D but didn't realize it: I'd doze of in the middle of the day, going to the washroom 4-5x per hour, always thirsty...
14. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=2, created=2025-10-08T21:49:05]: I went from 4.9 a1c to 7. In about 11 months. During the pandemic, stuck inside, stressed as fuck, only cooking/ baking to pass the time. It sucked. Also have read about people developing type 2 after covid at higher rates than was normal before (but also I have pcos)
