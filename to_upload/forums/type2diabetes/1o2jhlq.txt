Hey all. I am one month in after my blood glucose was in the 230s after a 12 hour fast and A1C in the 11 range. Prior, my glucose was inching up, but my diet has not changed. 54M, high blood pressure and gout for about 10 years, so I am not a stranger to weird labs and was taking HCTZ. But now, Metformin 2x day has me really urinating at night between 3 to 8 times a night. I have skipped the HCTZ and monitored my liquid intake and output and it’s still pretty frequent. Last PSA test was normal, no other issues with labs BUT, I have lost 60 pounds in 6 months for no reason. I have not changed diet until now. I am thirsty sometimes and out of frustration of being up all night urinating. Is frequent urination part of this deal? Will have kidney function labs done in a month at my request since my PCP hasn’t really pushed for some labs often (including uric acid for 2 years).

So prior to that and with an HbA1c of 11 you didn't have this issue? 🤔 I have never come across anyone who reports frequent urination because of metformin so I find this intreaguing. Also you are saying that you lost 60 pounds without trying.. And that your diet hasn't changed since being diagnosed T2? I would assume the weight loss was before the diagnosis? Do you check your BG pre-post meals at all?
