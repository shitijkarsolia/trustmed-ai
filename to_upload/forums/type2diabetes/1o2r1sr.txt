===============================================================================

Quick primer: 54-year-old male, was in pre-diabetic territory until blood test in July came back with a high fasting blood sugar (282), and a couple liver numbers also came back high. My doctor put me on metformin, and I have lost 15 pounds since (down at least 33 in last 18 months) and am eating smarter, cutting down on carbs and sugar. I bought a blood sugar meter and my numbers have looked good -- mostly in a non-diabetic range, and I've seen only a couple spikes over 200, and nothing higher than 221 -- and I'm getting an A1C test next week. I was laid off in May, and my doctor said my system might have went into warrior mode from the stress. Here's my question: Is anyone enrolled in the Teledoc diabetes management program? It's apparently a benefit of my health insurance, and I got something in the mail saying I'm eligible and can receive a free meter, strips, and lancets, as well as an app to track everything. It sounds legit, but I'm skeptical it's not Teladoc trying to market more of its services or get my health data, or that it's my usually good insurance trying to nudge me toward telehealth visits. Cynical? Yeah, perhaps, but I'm not sure free strips is worth whatever tradeoff (if any) is expected

2. u/rckblykitn14 [score=2, created=2025-10-10T10:07:44]: I have it!! They sent me a blood pressure monitor/cuff, glucose monitor and scale (body scale) all for free. I already got the first refill of test strips and lancets for the glucose monitor (also free and received in 2 days after just hitting 1 button on the monitor screen when I was running low). All 3 machines upload directly to the app so you can keep track of weight, BP and BS in there. The app has tons of other stuff too. 10000% worth it.

The diabetes nurse tracked my CGM and food log, and was helpful in figuring out connections and solutions. The wellness coach helped me reframe my feelings around food, exercise, and health. A year in, my A1c is 5.2 (from 9), I lost 65 pounds, and I have never been as healthy.
