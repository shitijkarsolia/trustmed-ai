My father has Diabetic Neuropathy in his feet. Any tips to combat this. We are working on a GLP1 and his diet is great, so just looking for a few “hacks” or remedies.

I think insurance may cover that as a doctor's visit, but I haven't had to do this myself, so I would check. Its very sterile and they can also inspect for any possible concerns while he gets his feet done. you can try compression socks, I have some and I do like them. Also invest in good shoes and try to keep his feet covered as much as possible. definitely have him talk to his doctor about it though. They'll be able to give the best advice.

There aren't any real hacks or remedies (at least none that I've read about that work). However you should have him check is feet regularly to make sure he hasn't hurt himself and doesn't realize it. That can lead to infections if not treated and could lead to amputations. 1. Daily foot care and protection 1. Daily inspection 2. Good socks and footwear 1. Buy GOOD shoes, not too big, or too small 2. GOOD socks so the feet can breath - avoid cotton because excessive sweat could cause blisters which can become infected 3. Moisturize carefully 4. Avoid extreme temperatures (heating pads) 5. Trim nails carefully 2. Improve circulation and reduce nerve stress 1. Gentle movement and exercise - low impact activities 2. Leg elevation and compression 1. Especially if his legs are swelling 3. Massage / foot stimulation 4. Warm Epsom salt soaks, with caution! Use warm, not hot water 1. In the winter, when I get back from a walk, I use Epsom salt soaks to rest my feet. I bought one of those foot soak thingies from WM last Christmas and love it. I don't have neuropathy, but do what I can to take care of my feet as I enjoy walking/cycling. There are other things you could try like topical relief such as capsaicin creams or patches, other topical analgesics, TENS or heat/infrared/phototherapy -- but I've never tried this, and never spoke to my endocrinologist about this, I've only read about it. Finally supplements and nutrients - but use caution! I've read the ALA may help, but there is no definitive proof. B vitamins are something else to try, especially if B12 is low but if its normal then this may not help (again, this might help, never any guarantees) and finally antioxidants or neuroprotective supplements. Before trying supplements or topicals - ask your doctor, you don't want to do more harm than good. I read about ALA/B12 here: [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/natural-diabetic-neuropathy-treatment](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/natural-diabetic-neuropathy-treatment) Hope this helps or gets you looking for more resources!
