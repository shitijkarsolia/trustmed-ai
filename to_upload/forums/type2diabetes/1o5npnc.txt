Started exercise and haven’t touched carbs . As of Saturday I have had 0 insulin and even went on a date with my wife to have ramen which is full of carbs and my glucose didn’t even hit 240 before dropping . It’s a wonderful feeling . Congrats keep up the hard work you got this !

Losing that much weight and reaching stable numbers without insulin shows how much dedication and consistency you have put in. It must feel amazing to see all that effort pay off and to have your body responding so well again. Really inspiring progress.
