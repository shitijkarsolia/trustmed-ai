===============================================================================

Has anyone here noticed their glucose readings changing with the seasons? I’ve been reading that temperature and sunlight can influence insulin response, and I’m curious if anyone’s tracked this over time.

2. u/alan_s [score=1, created=2025-10-13T19:30:08]: I have never noticed any weather effect on my blood glucose levels. I live in a temperate climate in Australia. Our local temperature rarely dips below 5C (40F) at night in midwinter and occasionally goes over 37C (100F) in summer. Possibly your more extreme Canadian conditions might give different results.
