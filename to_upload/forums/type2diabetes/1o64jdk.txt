===============================================================================

4 weeks ago i had labs taken due to some on going issues i have been having for the past year and a half.. that’s when i seen how out of control i have let myself get. my A1C was 9.4, the highest i have ever seen it. my dr told me she wanted to retest in 4 weeks then do a follow up in person. my results came back at 6.8. definitely better then i thought it would be for only 4 weeks time but i still feel so defeated. :/ hoping that the next retest i will be below 6.0. i have my in person visit on thursday so i hope i will get some more insight.
