===============================================================================

Been curious who feels that their weight loss has been the most important factor in their numbers improving. Of course dropping carbs goes hand in hand, but losing weight, for me, seems to be the biggest factor in my numbers dropping back to normal. I still have a fight with dawn phenomenon, but it's minor and usually resolves quickly. I don't take any meds and despise exercise, but trying to do better in that area.
