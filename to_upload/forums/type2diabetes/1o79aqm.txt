Hey everyone! I’ve been a T1D since I was 11 (13 years now), and lately I’ve been thinking about how different every single day is with diabetes even when things are constant, haha Right now I’m on insulin pens and dose based on my current blood sugar plus what I’m about to eat using my insulin to carb ratio. Some days everything is just right – blood sugar is great, I feel good, and it’s like I’ve cracked everything. Other days even the same meals, similar activity lead to completely different results. The insulin doses I take varies every day and at times variation is too high too for example when I sleep well, eat well vs when I do not sleep well and eat well I’ve gotten curious and too controlling about all the little variables – for example the timing of my food, what I am eating, what kind of exercise I am doing and when, whether I have slept well or not, am I anxious/ stressed. There are numerous combinations of these variables and all of them seem to have different impact I’d love to hear about your day-to-day: * What does your typical decision-making look like? (Whether you’re on pens, pump, Omnipod, or use wearables like CGMs, Whoop - I use this, Oura, Apple Watch etc) * How do you figure out what works for you – trial and error, patterns you’ve noticed, advice you follow? * Do you track anything beyond blood sugar? What are the best ways you use that info? I have seen that my HRV and blood sugars are kind of correlated. Poor HRV leads to bad sugar levels and vice versa. Poor HRV is also a function of poor sleep, so poor sleep –&gt; poor HRV –&gt; poor sugar levels - this process at times lead to a vicious cycle where I make poor food choices if not in a good mental state or just tired * How often do you reach out to doctors/ care coordinators/ nutritionist on a day to day basis? If not, do you feel the need to reach out to help you make better decisions and understand your body better? Do you use any resources or apps to help you make these decisions, if yes, how often? I’m really just curious about how other people approach this since we all seem to develop our own systems over time. Whether you’ve been at this for decades or are newer to it, I’d love to learn from your experience!

I use a CGM because I am on insulin (Trurapi Solostar and Tresiba), and really everyday can be a challenge. I am also on several medications plus supplements. Currently using the Libre 2 along with GlucoDataHandler so I get the numbers on my Galaxy Watch. I live in a house where nobody else is diabetic and can pretty well eat whatever they want so we have junk food along with A LOT of carbs. It can be VERY challenging to avoid it. First because it will spike my blood sugar and second, the calories + carbs as I'm trying to stay on a strict calorie deficit. I use LoseIt to plan my meals, enter into it what I'll probably have for lunch/dinner/snacks then see how much insulin I need to cover those inevitable spikes. Go for an A1C every 3 months and meet with my endocrinologist right after. No need to see a GP regularly for diabetes anymore, I can usually find what I need online and what I can't I'll make notes and speak to my endocrinologist when I see them. Went for diabetic counselling a few times since diagnosed, but they've never really helped me much. I already know what they were telling me, and the refreshers don't give me anything new. There are so many tools available online now that I find them a resource that's really meant for newer diabetics, at least, IMO. In addition to all that, the only thing that has really helped me has been intermittent fasting. Daily 16:8 and I'm trying to put back OMAD into the mix. I try to eat a lot of fruit - Hami Melons (with the green/white part -- lots of fibre), Apples, Plums, Berries, Bananas, Mangoes, etc., I know some are high in sugar, but it's not like drinking your sugars (sodas). Also trying to eat more vegetables - Okra, Eggplant, Sweet Potatoes, Asian Cabbage, Bok Choy... I've found solace in Asian or Asian inspired dishes since they are all high in protein, and except for the noodles low in carbs. When I opt for standard cuisine, I still make a lot of my own food especially sauces, dressings and deserts (amazing what you can do with cottage cheese). Everything I'm doing is *finally* working. My A1C has been hovering around 6.5 for the last year or so. Prior to this it was always in the 7s, or 8s because I was using insulin + medication as a crutch to eat whatever I wanted. In terms of exercise, I do these: * Cycling - 15km - 30km 2x to 3x per week * Walking 5km - 10km 2x to 3x per week * Strength Training 2x per week I try to keep one day as a rest day. I've also recently started taking swimming lessons. I still struggle with sleep, I stay awake too late and also use a CPAP as I was diagnosed about one-two years ago as having sleep apnea and my numbers were very bad. Another thing that's helped me is having an accountability buddy. I post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/), but also chat with my friend regularly. We keep each other in check when it comes to managing our diabetes and weight loss.

Numbers improved but still not where they should be. Quarterly visits to endo. Next visit i will find out more about them getting access to my cgm. But from what i have been reading they only check it before patient visits. I am now using my fitness pal app to track everything and keep every meal under 30 carbs, protein over 30 grams etc and that is helping keep the spikes down. Meds do not keep the spikes down on their own.
