Hi, i wondered if anyone knows if diabetes untreated can cause hair loss. I was trying to work on my diabetes with diet and an exercise but honestly, I would go three or four weeks doing excellent then break and go through a spell of eating whatever I wanted.. I had bad experiences with metformin. And a second medication that I can’t remember the name of. I don’t want to take GLP-1. I am afraid of medication, but I know I have to go to my doctor and get some kind of medication. Does anybody know if there are diabetic medications that are more easily tolerated? Im scared. Thank u for any yhoughts, advice, ex..

It honestly took my hair starting to fall out for me to realize something was seriously wrong. That was my wake-up call to cut out sugar and start getting my life together. At the same time, I started seeing a psychologist because I was afraid of taking medication and also had some untreated mental health issues. (Not saying that’s your situation, OP, but therapy really helped me get unstuck and start taking care of myself.) Once I worked through that, I was finally able to make and keep medical appointments. I found a doctor who actually listens and works with me. I started on metformin and Solostar for a while — it sucked, but it got my blood sugars down enough to make it easier to stay on a lower-carb diet. Taking my meds consistently was still hard at first, mostly because of my mental health, but over time I learned to give myself grace and keep trying. Eventually, my labs improved, and my doctor slowly reduced and discontinued some of my meds. My blood sugars got stable, but my weight stayed high. My doctor later added Mounjaro to help with weight management, and I’ve lost about 30 pounds so far. More importantly, I’m eating way healthier now and actually feel good about my habits. One big thing I struggled with was the going back and forth between doing great and falling off. What really helped me was focusing on one change at a time. Here’s how it went for me: First, quit smoking. Then, cut sugar. Then, work on mental health. Then, focus on taking meds and keeping appointments. Next, swap high-GI carbs for lower ones. Then, cook more and eat out less. Then, add more veggies and cut energy drinks. Everyone’s list will look different, but the key was starting with the highest impact and building slowly. For example, I used to eat white bread toast with butter for breakfast. Instead of quitting toast altogether, I just asked, “What’s one small swap I can make to make this a little better for my blood sugar?” Then once that stuck, I moved on to the next thing. It’s been a slow process, but a sustainable one. I’m still a work in progress, but I feel like I actually have control of my health now. Whatever path you take, OP, I’m wishing you good health and success, even small progress is still progress.

There are a number of options, GLP 1’s can take getting used to, but it’s one of the easiest in terms of actually taking it. Uncontrolled diabetes can affect the digestive system and impact how you absorb nutrients. This is because of inflammation but also due to your kidneys trying to flush your system constantly. This is partly why unexplained weightloss can be a symptom of diabetes. So yes, diabetes can cause hair loss, because you can become malnourished. There are a number of other things it could be though, so comprehensive blood work is key.
5. u/Ischarde [score=3, created=2025-10-15T11:59:23]: My hair loss is due to age and possibly hypothyroidism. I'm a Type 2 on insulin and Ozempic so hots are just a fact of life for me. But I do understand being wary of medications, especially the ones with side effects like metformin and jardience. I can't take either of them.
6. u/sacrificialroses [score=4, created=2025-10-15T10:24:25]: Metformin isn’t bad after you stop shitting, fiber powder can help with that. I feel you though injectables don’t sound fun because of some of the side effects that May happen. I’ve been taking januvia and jardiance with metformin and it’s helping a lot. Tbh adjusting to metformin is not fun, the GI symptoms go away if you eat enough and not too much junk and you stay hydrated. Fiber has made metformin very tolerable for me. Also never take it on an empty stomach you’ll get the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea…. I am honestly dealing with diabetes hair loss too, when I was off medication for a year and a half or two (I didn’t have insurance) I lost a lot of hair so yeah it does happen……. Taking meds will actually help prevent hair loss yes! Don’t give up, meds do help tbh and you don’t have to be perfect it’s ok to have days you eat “not the healthiest” but just try to slowly integrate less carbs as best as you can because it’s hard to live with a strict diet. You can do it! Oral medication isn’t as scary as injecting yourself in my opinion haha.
