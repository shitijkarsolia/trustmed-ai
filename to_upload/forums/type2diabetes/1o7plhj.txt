===============================================================================

My doctor cut my dosage down from 2000 to 1000, I'm a little bit nervous about this change as I've grown used to my routine with prescription dependency. I'm not sure what to expect, if I will need to modify my diet or if I can just stay on course with what I've been doing. I'm just curious what experience other people have had when they had their meds reduced.

My morning fasting number went up some on the drop from 1000 to 500 but I started being more consistent with a veggie starter and I stabilized back down. Then he stopped all my meds and I crept up to 5.8. That seemed fine for awhile but it became more difficult to maintain that 5.8 without going pure keto. Decided to restart Metformin and allow myself a few more carbs every day. I think I've found a happy spot.

3. u/Lizzielou2019 [score=4, created=2025-10-17T06:49:04]: I was on 1000mg of metformin until July, along with Mounjaro. My doctor told me to stop the Metformin and I was nervous about that at first because I was doing really well and had brought my A1C down to 5.3. I also have a CGM, so I constantly have a good idea of what my blood sugar is. After stopping the Metformin, my blood sugar was running higher and I was having more frequent highs. After that, it started leveling out again and went back down where it had been, if not below that. I should be around 5.3 or maybe even a little less when I go back to the doctor next week. I didn't really change my diet or exercise much in this time period.

In my own case when I have occasionally dropped my daily 2000mg dose to zero for a month or three changes in peak post-prandial blood glucose were minor and A1c rose by less the 0.2 percent. I went back on it on doctor's advice but I'm not really certain I need it.
5. u/Dishwaterdreams [score=3, created=2025-10-15T16:15:34]: Metformin doesn’t work for me as well as Glipizide. So that alters my experience. I get the exact same benefit from Metformin on 500mg and 2000mg. Just keep checking your numbers and note anything off.
