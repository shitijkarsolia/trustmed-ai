===============================================================================

Hi all! I am fairly new to this, got my diagnosis just last month on the 10th or 11th. I started checking my blood sugar every morning when I woke up, changed my diet, am on metformin 1000 mg a day, and just took my third dose of mounjaro 2.5 this morning. I haven’t been checking my blood sugar levels during the night very often, but decided I should do so tonight. I ended up with my lowest level I’ve ever seen, which was 104. This was about 2-3 hours after dinner and I had a few bites of ribs probably an hour before this as well. My blood sugar levels in the morning (so fasting levels) have been in the 118-130 range for the last 10 days or so. When I was diagnosed, I had been in the 170s. I am just wondering if it’s normal to see a lower number at night even after eating? I am super happy to see 104 since it’s by far the lowest I have seen, but was just incredibly surprised and expecting it to be much higher. Thanks for any thoughts or comments helping a newbie out!

Test a bit earlier at 60 to 90 minutes after eating: [When To Test](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/11/when-to-test-one-hour-or-two-hour.html)

Or more accurately it's normal to have a higher fasting level in the morning than what your level was before bed... it's called the dawn effect and as I understand around 4 in the morning or something your liver will start to release glucose into the blood... it's normal but with folks like us initially it can be a little more than you need! Metformin helps control that and of course all the changes you make going forward will also improve that.
