===============================================================================

I am going to begin intermittent fasting to hopefully put my diabetes into remission. I am not taking short acting nor long acting insulin and my fasting glucose levels are around 85. Are there any tips you guys can give? I don’t eat all day except a 2 hour window at 8-10 pm where I’ll have a salad.

I mean, I may go from 5.0 mmol/l to 5.5 mmol/l but not as drastic as it used to be (2, 3or 4 point rise). It's allowed me to cut back on insulin (I am dependent on it... both long and fast acting). My eating window typically ends by 7pm sometimes 8pm if I've gone out for a walk/bike ride so that when I get home I have fruit (usually an apple or two, banana or persimmon). I follow 16:8 but often it stretches to 17 or 18 hours. I try to keep my first meal light, especially on carbs and I try to limit my carbs to &lt; 100g per day (just remember, there are carbs in fruits, and vegetables -- but they are good ones). When I do eat, I try not to eat all my calories in one shot and spread it out over the day. So my 1st meal might be around 400 - 500 calories. My second meal around 600 - 800 calories then the remainder in snacks (which is almost always fruit). I am eating to a caloric deficit of around 1600 calories as I'm also working on losing weight. When I do wake up, I'm drinking either water, green tea with ginger + turmeric (black) or coffee (black). I try to drink 96oz of water daily.

Plenty of healthy protein and fats and a few low carb veg as well. Eat until you’re comfortably full. As long as carb count is under 30g per day, you’re in the sweet spot :). Don’t starve your body of what it needs. I ate bacon, small salad with blue cheese dressing, &amp; eggs every day.steak or salmon or shrimp. Cheese! Sugar free jello…..(love ketogenic eating!) Also… vary your fasting duration. Pick a minimum number of hours and then do a few long ones every week. Once a month, once you’re fully into the fasting approach, aim for a 36+ one.
5. u/Zeus783 [score=8, created=2025-10-19T01:52:03]: Please don't take any offence... But it doesn't sound like you know what you're doing! Eating a salad all day between 8/10 pm it's called *starvation*.. NOT Intermittent fasting. If getting off metformin is all you want just talk to your primary carer and stop taking it.. Your numbers are good already and I don't see the need of keep taking meds if your lifestyle allows you to maintain good BG without extra aid. You sound to be committed so use that drive to educate yourself before you dive into something that could mess with your achievements. I do IF (OMAD) and eat like a pig and don't take meds.. (last HbA1c 5.4). Starvation is not the answer and it's not what intermittent fasting means. You don't disclose any detail about your weight, gender, activities etc... So if you have loads of weight to loose IF is a good idea.. But prepare yourself for it and build into it. Supplementation might be necessary to make up for lack of nutrients that have been removed from your diet too. I'm not trying to discourage you from adopting an IF lifestyle... I'm simply saying it's not about NOT eating as some people may think. Only speaking from personal mistakes. 😑
6. u/yamahamama61 [score=2, created=2025-10-18T23:43:04]: I unknowingly developed an allergy to beef...an anything beef related. Even gravy. When it 1st happened I rushed to ER. I couldn't even swallow my own saliva. We couldn't figure out a few months what was causing it. I learned how to deal with it at home. Avoiding E.R. I would go 3 days without eating...because I just couldn't. No eating or drinking . I noticed after those 3 days of no eating. I had better control of my blood sugar. Before it was almost uncontrolled after having 5 episodes I know what sets my blood sugar soring. An where not to eat. An I don't have to take as much meds. An my A1-,C is down to 7:
7. u/JEngErik [score=1, created=2025-10-18T22:11:41]: Congratulations! IF is one of the lifestyle changes I made to keep me off medication for the past 2 years. I needed help from metformin and Mounjaro in the beginning, 3 years ago. But since then, I've managed to maintain an hbA1c under 5 with IF and many other changes too. You got this 💪
8. u/anthonythagr8 [score=2, created=2025-10-18T22:02:10]: I been working out , starting at 15lb of three sets of 12 and then move up to 20 lbs at 3 sets of 12 then back down to 15s of 3 sets of 12 to cool down and then bicycle for fifteen minutes. I got my A1c from 7.3 down to 6.5 in a few months
9. u/alan_s [score=3, created=2025-10-18T16:43:16]: &gt; my fasting glucose levels are around 85. That is perfect. What is your present diet and meds regimen and why do you feel the need to fast?
10. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=2, created=2025-10-18T16:28:40]: You don't need to fast to lower your blood glucose levels. You just need to lose weight (perhaps), if you can afford to lose it. The fasting thing is BS from the likes of Jason Fung, the kidney specialist who decided that writing about diabetes was more profitable than kidneys. Much of his second book, the 'Diabetes Code', and the notion that you need to fast to lose weight, is total BS. So is much of everything else written about fasting in relation to diabetes. Just eat less food. Calories matter. Sure, fasting causes a person to eat less food in a day but it's also a gimmick. If you want to eat three meals a day do just that, but keep calories in mind. Intermittent fasting is only effective if you end up eating less food in a day. It's magical thinking, where stuffing yourself with food between certain hours is magically better than eating the same amount of food spaced out over the course of a day. Personally I like to eat a little something in the morning. I also like to eat a little something before I go to bed if I feel very hungry, so I can get to sleep. This is practical, non-magical weight loss. If you prefer the magical rules from some arcane book, do that, but know that 'intermittent' anything is just a way to convince you to eat less food over the course of a day. If you like you can just eat the same amount of food any time you like in any 24 hour period and get the same results.
11. u/Anthropogenic12 [score=2, created=2025-10-18T16:05:49]: I'm in remission. It takes constant attention. I eat 10 - 15g of carbs per day, without cheat days. This is the way I do it. There are other ways. I cannot process carbs, so I don't eat any carbs. That's my way. It may not be yours.
12. u/PurpleRayyne [score=3, created=2025-10-18T16:04:33]: 85 is a perfectly normal fasting glucose. I'd be more concerned that you are not eating enough. how less than 1000 calories per day? that is a great way to create OTHER health problems. I won't push 3 meals because even I don't eat 3 meals. I eat lunch and dinner. breakast is coffee with half&amp;half and 2tbsp of creamer. Even if you dont want full meals , at least snack on some low glycemic veggies, cheese, nuts,etc. My new favorite is whole fat greek yogurt with frozen fruit and a tiny bit of sugar to take the tang out. 20+ grams of protein. works perfect for days where I either work 7:30-2 or a mid day shift 10-4 when I don't want to eat a big meal because I'm too busy. I also eat whiel I work (I work retail and work the register and the floor at the same time).
13. u/TheRealLougle [score=1, created=2025-10-18T15:37:47]: Fasting is most successful when you are fat adapted. Using fat for fuel vs glucose. Go low carb first before you begin fasting. My longest fast was 6.5 days. My shortest fast these days is 23 hours, one meal a day. For the month of October I am doing a 72-hour fast challenge. One 72-hour fast per week for the month. You are going to love fasting.
14. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=1, created=2025-10-18T15:35:21]: Your fasting glucose level is already a normal less (less than 100). Based on that number at least, you would already be considered in remission. Can I ask what number(s) you’re trying to change with IF? Not trying to fight you about it, just genuinely curious :)
