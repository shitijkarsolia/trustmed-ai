===============================================================================

I have pretty stable and under control blood glucose levels just by using metformin 1000mg twice a day and through diet and exercise. The thing is that I have a martial arts black belt grading coming up in 2 weeks time, which will be 6 hours long and will only have brief breaks for water &amp; to shove something in our mouths along the way. I know it sounds brutal but that’s just the way it is. The trouble is that everyone has been told about “carb loading” the night before. This then made me panic - what do I do for this? Also what do I do if my bg tests really high again during strenuous exercise?

Six hours of martial arts grading definitely qualifies as endurance-level activity, and it’s great that you’re already managing your blood sugar well with metformin and consistent habits. “Carb loading” for endurance athletes is usually meant for people doing events that last several hours at a competitive intensity, and even then, it’s more about ensuring energy availability than eating a massive amount of carbohydrates. For someone with type 2 diabetes, the focus is more on steady fuel rather than big spikes. You might find that eating balanced meals with a mix of complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats the day before works better than trying to overload. During the grading, quick snacks that digest easily, like a banana, a few nuts, or a small energy bar can help keep your energy up without sending your glucose soaring. If your blood sugar climbs during exertion, that’s actually common; stress hormones and adrenaline can push it higher temporarily. Most people find it returns to baseline once the activity ends and hydration kicks in. Since your event is close, you might want to test your response during practice sessions this week so there are no surprises on the day. You’re clearly well-prepared and paying attention to your body, which is exactly what keeps things safe and effective for big endurance efforts like this.
