===============================================================================

So I went to the endocrinologist had some test ran got my results back. Turns out I'm insulin resistant so he put me on insulin he said for maybe a month to kickstart my pancreas and to continue taking my Metformin. It went well for the first week. This past week it has been pure hell. I have had severe diarrhea every day and I just cannot take it. I am a delivery driver and I am not always near a bathroom so it has been really a big struggle for me. Has anyone had this problem and what helped because I have taken Imodium it did nothing. Yesterday I did not take my Metformin and I did not have that problem. So this morning I took it with my breakfast and guess what it's back again. I can't continue like this. I don't know why the first week went so good and now this week has just been terrible. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Metformin ER can still upset the stomach for some people, even after it seemed fine at first. Sometimes taking it right after a meal instead of before helps a bit. The timing can matter too, like switching from morning to evening. If it keeps happening, it might be worth letting the doctor know. Some people need a lower dose or a different version that’s easier on the stomach. You’re definitely not the only one who’s gone through this. It just takes a little trial and error to find what works best.

My best advice is take with a decent breakfast other than a bar or shake. If that’s the case take with your lunch and something a little substantial that it can get absorbed.

4. u/Jerry11267 [score=1, created=2025-10-20T04:50:34]: Theirs many other medications for controlling diabetes. I couldn't handle metformin so my doctor changes the meds to something I could handle.
5. u/Big_Tie_8055 [score=1, created=2025-10-20T04:35:47]: My partner takes metformin and has dumping syndrome from it. I’ve been on it 31 years and it hasn’t affected me.
6. u/Equivalent-Yoghurt38 [score=3, created=2025-10-20T04:08:22]: I couldn’t tolerate the Metformin. I was doubled up with stomach cramps 3 hours after I took it every day. The doctor gave me Glipizide ER and Mounjaro and I’m doing way better on that.
7. u/Indie516 [score=2, created=2025-10-19T18:43:22]: I haven't had any issues caused by that combo, but I do find that if I have too much dairy, fat, or grease/oil in a meal with metformin, then I will have problems. Also, soy, for some reason. Too much soy with the metformin sends me straight to the bathroom.

10. u/KJamesonon [score=6, created=2025-10-19T16:04:45]: What does your “breakfast” consist of? I find if I eat well, the metformin “goes easy” on me, and when I slack off, it’s worse. Rather than lean on meds as a crutch to keep my sugars in check, I use them as persuasion to not eat like garbage and feel the wrath later on. Plain Greek yogurt, hard boiled eggs and some low sugar fruit like berries? Good to go. Breakfast sandwich, fried eggs, full sugar yogurt, banana? I’m in for a world of hurt well before lunch. If you’re already eating a healthy breakfast, ignore my comment and talk to your doctor.
11. u/akaMichAnthony [score=4, created=2025-10-19T16:00:50]: It took me a good 2 months before my body stopped wanting to shit itself. Are you taking metformin or metformin er (extended release)? Doc started me on just metformin but when I told him it was wrecking my innards, he switched me to the extended release. Still took a few weeks but eventually my body adjusted.
