===============================================================================

Many people with type 2 diabetes notice that blood sugar tends to rise during stressful periods, even when diet and medication are well-controlled. Stress hormones such as cortisol can temporarily increase glucose levels. What approaches have helped manage these spikes, mindfulness, short walks, breathing exercises, or medication timing adjustments?

2. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=1, created=2025-10-22T08:06:00]: I have stress related spikes. BUT that is largely because I have ( had- been working on this) high levels of cortisol.
3. u/Zeus783 [score=1, created=2025-10-22T01:50:37]: I literally just ordered some cortisol reducer like ashwagandha mixed with whatever else. I have used it in the past with very good results and then completely forgot to reorder it. It really worked for me and had better fasting BG since my sleep was better. Look it up see if it's something useful to you too perhaps?

5. u/SquirrelWatchin [score=1, created=2025-10-21T10:52:01]: Running, bike riding, sometimes yoga. If it is really bad, and sometimes they are. They get addressed via a small dose of insulin as directed by my medical team. For me personally, vigorous exercise itself causes a rise that is transient, and doesn’t have to be treated with meds at all. So effectiveness of these should be measured like 30 minutes or so after the cessation of the given activity. Your mileage may vary.
