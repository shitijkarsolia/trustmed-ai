===============================================================================

Hey guys! I recently went to the doctor with symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, and overall irritability. I thought it might be a thyroid issue, but nope I’m diabetic. I’m relatively young (22) and am feeling a bit disheartened by this news. I know I have to change my habits to help myself, but I feel like I will also be missing out on part of my 20s. I have a big family history of type 2 diabetes and I always figured I would get it, just not this soon. I also have a history of disordered eating and am not sure how to go about changing my died in a sustained way. Overall I’m just feeling overwhelmed, please let me know if you guys have any advice!

Let your new blood glucose meter or CGM guide you. I wrote this to help you begin: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.
2. u/Stellar_Crafter [score=2, created=2025-10-21T15:28:24]: With a history of disordered eating, I would strongly recommend working with a registered dietitian and look into therapy. There is unspoken grief that comes with a diabetes diagnosis. My doctors did not give me a heads up in that. You will have to learn what works for you. All of us respond differently to medications and different foods. Don’t drastically change your eating habits and exercise habits without talking to your doctors. That said, you got this. It’s work, but it’ll be worth it. I just got diagnosed this past March at 40. I knew it was coming, but never changed my lifestyle before hand. Both my parents are type 2 and I’m overweight (though I have lost a lot since I made changes). I sleep better (mostly) and have more energy.

You got this man this doesn’t define you as a person.

It felt so lonely and isolating BUT I'm here at 29 in a better place most of the time 😀 My biggest advice is walk after eating, get a walking pad if you can! Cut carbs but still include some complex carbs (sweet potatoes etc) because brain fuel. Add veggies in any way you can manage and add more beans/lentils to the diet! Fiber is so important. Take things day by day and know that you're investing in your health by becoming more active and fueling your body well ❤️ Also - get a continuous glucose monitor if you can - helps know what food spikes you and is a good education tool!

I was so shocked and in a complete daze and didn’t actually fully process it for another year. I thought it was a death sentence and was overwhelmed with so much thoughts. I had a real shift in mindset in 2014, overhauled my diet (low carb) and adjusted my lifestyle. The way I positioned it was that it was a wake up call and if I sort myself out, I’ll be fine and essentially tracked medically for life (if you’re a diabetic in the UK, all treatments and tests and check ups are free). I ended up losing 15kg (15% of body weight) and went into remission in 2015. No meds and a1c in the normal rage. I had a great 20s, ate at great restaurants, out several times a week in London and loved life. I’m now in my mid 30s and reasonably under control with my diabetes They’ve caught you (us) early. Take action to get to a good baseline and use that as a platform.

8. u/Erza88 [score=5, created=2025-10-21T11:53:57]: My best advice is to take it one day at a time. View this as a lifelong change and not some fad. There are no goals you need to rush to, ya know? Make changes slowly. Take the time to learn all about carbs and how they affect your sugar levels. At the same time, keep track of the things you enjoy eating and see how those affect your numbers. I recommend the channel "Beat Diabetes" with Dennis Pollock. He does a great job explaining things. People don't want to accept it, but carbs really are the main issue. This doesn't mean you have to go zero carbs, but the less you consume, the better. However, diabetes is a very personal disease, so your tolerance will vary greatly from everyone else. You may be able to eat things that some folks can't... For example, potatoes don't really spike me, so I can have them in moderation. Eventually you'll know exactly what you can and can't have. And you know what? You can treat yourself once in a while too. The important thing here is moderation! It'll be a longish process, but I think if you truly take the time to learn about the disease, how certain foods affect your numbers, and you take it one day at a time, you'll be just fine. It's not a race. It's a lifestyle change. There'll be days when you wanna say "fuck that, I'm tired of this shit!" and that's ok. Allow yourself to feel your feelings. Just dust yourself off and get back on the saddle. Good luck and don't hesitate to come to this sub with questions etc!
9. u/Ethan-Wakefield [score=0, created=2025-10-21T11:32:22]: Apologies in advance if this is too bitter of a pill: For me, one of the the biggest things was identifying who in my life was toxically positive, and never talking to them about my diabetes. I had one friend who said she did a "no carb detox" and she never felt carb cravings again. She regaled me with stories about how she would eat an apple, and the sweetness from the apple felt sickeningly, cloyingly sweet. She said that after her detox, just having a single bite of an apple was more than enough dessert. A single dark chocolate truffle would be enough to satisfy her sweet cravings for a week because she simply couldn't handle any more sugar than that. Another friend told me that she envied me, because now I was going to finally experience swiss chard for the first time, and she wished she could have the great privilege of eating chard for the first time once again. And I was like... WTF? I went weeks and weeks feeling like something was wrong with me, because I've never come around to chard. I've never gotten to the point where I eat spinach and say "I never understood the natural sweetness in these green vegetables! Spinach really is nature's Snickers bar!" I've had apples since then, and I have never once found an apple to be sickeningly sweet, like it was made of pure sugar. None of the "great reset" I was told to expect ever materialized. And over a year out from my diagnosis, I'm virtually certain that I am never going to look at a green lettuce the way I look at a piece of apple pie. I just do not think it is going to happen (but it has happened to people I know, and I guess... great for them). Listening to my friends who go on and on about how improved their lives are after diabetes just... makes me crazy. They all tell me that I have a defeatist attitude, because I insist on seeing diabetes as a bad thing, but I genuinely think I'm happier without them. They have "keto competitions" where they "race" each other to see who can have fewer carbs in a week. Lowest carbs wins bragging rights. And I guess that's totally fine for them? But it is just not for me. Probably my A1C numbers would be better if I were more like them (I must sadly admit) but I truly believe that if I tried to get too far into their head space, I would fail and just feel like shit about myself. So my numbers are not great, but I think I'm actually happier if that makes sense. (I know; how can I be happy if my numbers are not great? Maybe this is cognitively dissonant. I have no good answers.)

Write a food diary. Keep a small note pad with you. Note down time/date an what you ate. Get a bigger note book an keep track of blood sugar reading.
11. u/PacRimRod [score=5, created=2025-10-21T11:10:25]: Look at it as an opportunity! I was stunned last year when I was diagnosed and how much I let myself go after some knee injuries. I viewed that as the low point, but also the chance to change my life and my habits for the better! I have lost 70 pounds, revamped my whole diet and exercise routine, changed my attitude towards food, etc. The diagnosis may literally have saved my life! At the very least it is already making my life more accountable and enjoyable! Good luck, you got this!!
12. u/Character-Reaction12 [score=1, created=2025-10-21T11:06:53]: Hi. Take a deep breath. You got this. 12 years ago I was 32. I was almost 300lbs. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetic. I started losing my eye sight and I just didn’t take care of myself. Finally went to the dr. I WISH I had gone to the doctor at 22! A1C was 13. I was told I needed a double hip replacement due to cartilage deterioration from high blood sugar and I started medication injections in my eyes for retinopathy. I refused to get a hip replacements because I was only 32 years old. Instead, I hired a personal trainer three days a week and over a 5 year period I lost 120lbs. I also found that I love running and biking. I started doing smaller triathlons, trail running, and half marathons, and then completed a half Ironman. Since 2018 I’ve completed over 50 races! At 44, Im in the best shape of my life. What pushed me was losing eyesight and mobility. Please don’t let that happen. Find motivation in something you love. You’re so young and you’ll find new things to enjoy. Please don’t let things progress to where I did. Let that be motivation for you. I have the most amazing friends that have encouraged me and supported me; that helps more than anything. I eat low carb / very low sugar. Being heathy and fit, and not wanting to go blind or have other major health issues, keeps me motivated everyday. - Eat low carb and cut refined sugars out. - Find the right medications. Look into Invokana. - Exercise. Play disc golf, bike, walk trails. Keep moving. - Find supportive friends and talk to them about your diagnosis and how you want to fight it. - Drink water. You found out young. Thats a great thing! It’s NOT the prison many think it is.
