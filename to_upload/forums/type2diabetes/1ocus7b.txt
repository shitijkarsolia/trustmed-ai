===============================================================================

So last week I went in to the Dr after feeling weird and having lots of symptoms for several months, did a bunch of blood work etc, then my pcp calls yesterday morning to tell me I have diabetes, and apparently my A1C levels were basically off the charts…she says that she’s putting me on metformin er and insulin glargine and see you in a couple months…..doesn’t really explain what to do or what I should worry or not worry about…the pharmacists said I needed to ask about classes but I don’t even think that sort of thing is available to me here. I’m just kind of at a loss rn and I don’t even know where to begin… can anyone recommend a good resource for type 2 meal plans. Any tips or pointers for someone new to this whole thing? The sucky thing is I live in a really rural area right now so I don’t have a lot of options or things available to me like I would in the city. I’ve started taking Metamucil along w my meds, but my blood sugar is still pretty high, I’m still getting the Me Myself and Irene level cottonmouth and going pee a million times at night, among other things and now I’m paranoid about being in ketoacidosis, am I just tripping? Is that something I should be worried about, and how do I test for that without going to the Dr? This sucks.

I am T2 (5 years now) and have discovered that trying to eat Keto is helping a lot to stabilize my blood sugar levels. I have also found that wearing a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) is VERY helpful in determining in real-time what foods spike my levels more than others. There are TONS of YouTube videos about diet and management of T2. Drink lots of water. I know it may seem counterintuitive since you are already getting up to go pee several times during the night, but once your levels come down, it will get better. Try to get in a little of exercise (this is my weak area) Get used to testing your blood (with the prick test) once or twice a day to keep track of your progress, especially if you are concerned with DKA. It will take a few weeks for the Metformin and insulin to really start working. I am taking 2,000 mg of Metformin a day plus 2mg dose of Ozempic once a week.

Ditched the sweet drinks too which was the hardest for me. Down 18kg and blood sugar ( mostly ) in range. I was offered metformin but decided to try diet change first. It's surprising how contradictory the health advice can be but eating the same three or four meals in rotation helps

If you can meet a dietitian it is very important for these moments, especially if it is a subject that you have never covered. You can watch doctors on YouTube who give advice (search only for doctors). Look at the story of the mayor of New York and his diabetes. Order a book or two from Medecin on diabetes. Try to keep a cool head and tell yourself that you can make mistakes during your learning but that you can get there over the days and weeks that follow.

I’m now on a Calorie counting app. I was prescribed metformin and ozempic. Both have proven to help. My a1c was 11.2. I haven’t had it checked yet but I workout daily even if it’s only for 30 minutes. Bought a treadmill and weights and just get to it. Usually start with a walk. Make sure you’re watching your sugars and carbs. Really don’t want processed foods. May take a little more work to make the foods but it’s worth it. You can inbox with any question and if I can help I will. Need a buddy to diet with you I got you too easy. Let’s do it!! You got this.

6. u/Emergency-Hippo2797 [score=1, created=2025-10-22T02:02:03]: First, shop for a new doctor. Mine didn’t even bring up taking drugs, and told me to try lowering my blood sugar by a Ketogenic diet, and we’ll do a new A1C in three months. I’ve found lots of good advice on Youtube. Also check out Jason Fung’s book, The Diabetes Code.

8. u/[deleted] [score=1, created=2025-10-21T19:51:08]: Everyone else’s advice here is bang on. And even though it’s scary right now, there’s no need to panic. I cried in my doctor’s office when I was diagnosed 😅 Take deep breaths. Make sure you have protein and produce at each meal. Drink water. Choose complex carbohydrates instead of simple ones, meaning you want ones with lots of fiber. Go for walks. You got this!
9. u/gertymoon [score=3, created=2025-10-21T19:41:17]: Yeah, sounds like your typical diagnosis, here's some drugs, have fun scenario. =) Firstly, you're going to be fine but you're going to have to do some work and learn about nutrition and understand the core reasoning as to why your blood sugar is so high and that usually goes directly with your diet and level of activity. Take a look at what you eat now, what type of foods is it? Take a look at the carbs in those foods, just add up a meal and see where it's at. Diabetics wants to keep those carbs as low as possible, it doesn't mean you can't have certain foods but it does mean you need restraint. You can't be eating pasta/rice/breads for lunch and dinner 7 days a week anymore. Take it slow, research on the internet, come to these forums and ask questions, we want to help and we are all fighting the same disease.
10. u/ChaoticDaddy5 [score=2, created=2025-10-21T18:38:23]: My A1C levels were &gt;15.5 back in 2023 when I got diagnosed. I was overweight at 260 and ate terribly. I went cold turkey after my diagnosis because I was scared about it all and had no clue. No more soda, no more sugar. They just gave me paperwork and I had follow ups every couple months. I was put on metformin and insulin at night. You can do it. Just pick better healthy options and drink more water. The medications take time but it’ll get easier in time. It was helpful to do check ups every couple months with my doctor. Just ask all the questions you can. I usually do cottage cheese with half a cubed up apple and a ton of cinnamon for breakfast. And dinner you just gotta do some veggies and protein with good carbs. I honestly used google to research A LOT of things. There’s the Glycemic Index that you can use. It tells you what carbs raise your blood sugars the most. I just type in “potato’s GI” into google and it shows you. But yeah, just do some research. Everyone’s bodies are different and react differently. Good luck and you got this! It’s a slow process so don’t beat yourself up over things.

You can get sticks (cardboard strips) at the drugstore (over the counter, no script) that you pee on to check your ketones. You can get them off of Amazon as well. Somewhere in one of these subs someone has pinned their stater guide.
12. u/mereshadow1 [score=1, created=2025-10-21T18:31:16]: I use both long acting, which was what you were prescribed, and short acting at meal times. You should be able to adjust the dosage of your insulin to help lower your overall readings. I actually inject 1/2 of my long acting in the morning and inject the other half at bedtime. You need to be very careful adjusting your insulin so that you don’t have a catastrophic low. You should also investigate getting a CGM, which will give you your blood sugar readings in real time. This will also help you track what foods impact your blood sugar. I can eat salads with relatively little insulin, but a cheeseburger sends me over the top. Good luck, this is a marathon, not a sprint.
