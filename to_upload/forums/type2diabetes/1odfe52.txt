===============================================================================

I just recently got diagnosed at the age of 28. I saw it coming with a long line of diabetics in my family tree. However, I never thought it would come this early. I have been struggling to find the right food choices and really appreciate my cgm.It has helped at lot! That said I always wake up with high numbers even around 150 sometimes as high as 170 and that's with a dosage increase. I have read about the dawn phenomenon but my numbers do not start to fall down until 2pm then it drops to around 105. I've tried intermittent fasting , eating a small break fast first thing in the morning and eating early dinner nothing seems to help. By the evening my blood sugar is not nearly as touchy however in the morning even the smallest bit of carbs sends my blood sugar sky rocket. Ie a cup of coffee with a splash of cream will land me in the 210s range My doctor put me on metformin and gave me glipizide to work congruently. But it does not make any difference on my morning - afternoon numbers. Does any one have any tips or can relate ?

I was able to see my blood sugar stabilize overnight/in the morning with a continuous glucose monitor within a couple of days of doing that. That cgm really helped figure out my patterns, that info was so valuable!
