===============================================================================

I’ve been eating less than 30 total carbs per day since May, but my numbers are still high. I have cut down considerably on medications with the help of walking and diet changes. Im still confused why I have such high numbers that last forever in the mornings when I’ve been being so strict for so long. I’m on 25 units of long acting insulin as well as 2k mg metformin / 4 mg glimepiride. Some mornings it just goes to 275 for what seems like no reason. I know the dawn phenomenon is a thing but I’d expect it to get better after this amount of time. I’ve also lost like 60 lbs and am at 220 currently. When on insulin I gain weight like crazy… one reason I’m trying to cut back a lot on that. I used to take over 150 units of short acting a day. I walk 15k-25k steps a day. I’ve tried glp1 drugs but those give me the world’s worst heartburn. What else could be wrong with me?

3. u/JustKimNotKimberly [score=1, created=2025-10-23T09:05:32]: If your sugars are always high in the morning, research “Dawn Phenomenon.“ Ask your medical professional if an insulin pump can help you. That was my problem, and I had to get an insulin pump to have insulin added around 3 AM and continually until around 8 AM
