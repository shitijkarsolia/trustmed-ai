===============================================================================

My dr suggested medicated but I asked if I could give it 3 months and on my own with diet and exercise lost weight and see if I can bring my A1C down naturally. She was totally ok with waiting 3 months and seeing if I can do it without the medication first. I've seen a lot of people say you can bring down the a1c with diet and weight loss but can you still do it without the medication? I've also read some day once the A1C hits above a specific number you can't do it without medication. Anyone willing to share their journey and if anyone was able to reverse it naturally without medication ?

I happened to be staying right around the corner from one who is also a naturopath. It was covid times and he wasn’t able to get Chinese herbs at the time, but gave me some Indian ones. I swam laps daily and took the herbal medicine, cut carbs. Lost 35 pounds and got my Hba1c down to 5.6 within months. I don’t remember what I started at. When I refused to take the drugs, the doctor who diagnosed me refused to monitor me. Herbs were probably gymnema sylvestre and Berberine. I’ve taken a few, so not 100% sure which ones I started with. Berberine has been proven to be just as effective as Metformin. You don’t need the drugs and their side effects. For me, bread was just not that important. I eat mostly low sugar fruits (berries) and a little melon. Low carb/high fat diet works for me with nutritional support. Getting plenty of protein is very important.
2. u/Sheer-Terror-OG [score=1, created=2025-10-23T17:19:56]: My experience was similar. I started at 6.8, started walking daily, and cut out the sugar. My doctor reluctantly gave me three months to try to right the ship. My next visit in three months I had lost 20 pounds and my A1C was a 6.4. At 6 months, I was down thirty pounds and my A1C was 5.9. One regret I have is that I didn't start testing my blood glucose as my doctor advised against it. I wish I would have, because my next A1C was 6.2, and my suspicion was a protein powder I was using. If I were testing, I would have known to tighten up on my diet. If you read Wall-Lives' comment below, that is pretty much a carbon copy of what I am working on.

4. u/anthonythagr8 [score=1, created=2025-10-23T15:18:53]: Yes if you workout and do weights the muscles will absorb the sugar , I did dumbbell workouts for a month and a half and got my a1c from 7.3 down to 6.5
5. u/maec1123 [score=2, created=2025-10-23T10:58:39]: I'm going to be completely honest here. Yes, you can control your blood sugar with diet and exercise but now that you've been diagnosed as diabetic, you'll always be diabetic. I would get on the meds until you get it under control them look at moving off of them when you do. You also need to find out how your body is reacting. Are you only spiking when eating? Is your fasting glucose high? Does stress increase your glucose? Certain foods only? Get a continuous glucose monitor for 90 days and analyze it. It'll help in the long run. My fasting is perfect and sometimes runs low. But my spikes go 300+. I'm actually going to ask about insulin on my next visit.
6. u/Hippo_lover76 [score=3, created=2025-10-23T09:22:49]: I trialed a few meds and they were not for me. It’s not a huge surprise- I tend to be overly sensitive to side effects. So I’ve had to do it on my own. I was diagnosed in early May at 9.3 and as of a couple of weeks ago my A1C is 5.8. I only eat carbs that come from vegetables, drink a ton of water, and try to keep my protein and fat intake on the moderate side. No alcohol, no caffeine. It was a wild transition, but seeing my numbers go down has been worth it.
7. u/SmaugTheMagnificent [score=1, created=2025-10-23T06:48:16]: My initial bit of control was changing my diet a little, and walking for 30 minutes 5 days a week. I think I got mine down to 6.1 from around a 6.7 on my own before we added the lowest level metformin dose.
8. u/Negative_Joke_1912 [score=5, created=2025-10-22T20:20:15]: Diagnosed in 2023 with a 9.6 a1c. Three months later my a1c was 5.1, no meds. I changed my diet and walked a bit more. I haven’t had an a1c over 5.5 since. You can control type 2 with diet and exercise alone and you are smart to recognize that. Think carefully on how you are going to change your diet. My goal still is overall health and blood glucose control. I chose a very low fat whole food diet. I eat till I am full and have lost over 40 lbs. Good fortune on your journey.
9. u/IMAGINARIAN_photos [score=8, created=2025-10-22T16:59:33]: My A1C was 6.7 in May. I refused to start meds, as my Dr wanted. I pledged that I would bring it down with a 100% lifestyle change. I cut out all of the ‘usual suspects’ like processed foods, all things flour (bye bye pizza), very few carbs, most foods with a label, etc. I food shop around the outer edges. Produce, dairy, meat, and seafood (when frozen shrimp are on sale, lol. And very few items from the aisles, ie canned tuna and salmon.) My recent A1C was 5.4. Just a radical and super healthy lifestyle change and A LOT of time on my treadmill. It absolutely can be done. And there’s NO going back for me. I lost 27 pounds and I feel terrific.
10. u/Wall-Live [score=3, created=2025-10-22T16:37:48]: So what you want to do is hard. I will tell you that you have a good Dr that’s not pushing meds. Things that helped me Glucose goddess This sub Reading Nutrition-no sugar, no carbs, nothing white. Focus on protein, fats and veggies. Cook at home. Find substitutes for things you can’t live without. I do make keto cookies and biscuits. Yup, they help with the cravings. Limit processed foods. Drink water Sleep- often overlooked. Take a hard look at your habits. You need 8 hrs. Move- 10k steps min. Every single day. Find something you enjoy. Bike, swim. Weights. I didn’t my first year and I regret that decision. My numbers are 5-10pts lower fasting. Measure- fasting glucose under 100 every day. The truth here is if your body is going to respond to a lifestyle change this will not be too hard. You need a baseline.
11. u/denialmakesyouhip [score=3, created=2025-10-22T16:05:09]: Honestly it just depends. Nothing wrong with trying it without meds, and nothing wrong with using them. I managed to drop mine without meds, but it was HARD. Now I’m on Ozempic and try to be mindful of what I eat but other than that not much and my numbers have only been improving. It’s nice knowing I could do it without meds, but I love bread and want to take advantage of having access to great meds!
