Hi all - new here! Both my mom and dad were diagnosed with the past 5 years and have been managing on their own since. I recently talked to my mom about her diagnosis and what information she got from her doctor at the time and was stunned at the little guidance she received. She was simply told “eat better” and referred to a nutritionist to learn what food works best with her meds. For about 6 months in the last year I took her to the gym with me to do strength training and she saw a lot of improvement but she’s now on a GLP-1 after a spike in her A1-C likely due to her no longer working out and falling back into old eating habits for a while. Curious what other people’s experiences were like in terms of the guidance received from doctors once diagnosed? Did you find it helpful, over or underwhelming, supportive??

2. u/deacc [score=1, created=2025-10-23T08:31:51]: I don't even have an endo because I don't need one. I know about nutrition and I know what I shouldn't be eating now that I am diabetic. I also learn how much my body can process carbs and protein base on time of day. I got T2 not because of my diet, but because of genetics. Plus in the age of the internet, you can do all kinds of research yourself and learn. I personally like my PCP, she does not try to adjust my meds too quickly and our long term go (I was diagnosed about 3.5 months ago) is to get me off long acting insulin. I am already off fast acting which I was only using sparingly. I am also on metformin.
3. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=2, created=2025-10-22T17:47:28]: My doctor gave very little and very basic dietary suggestions (switch white potatoes for sweet potatoes, switch white rice for brown rice) and offered medication and some further reading from ADA etc. This may be partly because I told her I wanted to try to reduce my A1C without medication at first. I did a lot of reading on my own and made dietary changes on my own, and when I went for my next check up a few months later I had a bunch of questions based on what I’d read and what I hadn’t been able to find a good answer for. She admitted it isn’t her area of specialization and said she’d refer me to speak with the clinical pharmacist at the same clinic, who does specialize in diabetes. I had an appointment with the pharmacist and got my remaining questions answered. So, to answer your question, I think most GPs/PCPs don’t have much in-depth knowledge about diabetes. They can present prescription options and refer to specialists (dietician, endocrinologist, clinical pharmacist, etc) but I think in most cases they’re not going to offer a great deal of direct support themselves. I really like my doctor and actually appreciated that she was honest about not being an expert. Like, of course she’s not, but she was willing to help me connect with experts, which I think is key.
4. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=1, created=2025-10-22T17:09:04]: My doctor asked me if anyone ever told me I am diabetic. I said no. He said ‘eat more avocados’ and that was it. I had to ask if I had diabetes, he said yes. I asked if I should be on insulin or another medicine, he said they ‘don’t use insulin’ anymore and that was it. No guidance at all, and ‘eat more avocados’ is now a huge joke in this house whenever something serious happens. I ended up using a glucose monitor and test strips leftover from when my roommate had gestational diabetes, but had no way to do much about the results. I have a different doctor now, who said I have ‘wildly uncontrolled’ diabetes, and put me on metformin and a glp-1. My sugars are much better already.
