===============================================================================

Hey again! I posted yesterday asking about people’s experiences with their doctors when they got diagnosed around the guidance they received and thanks to all who replied! I really try to help my mom improve her diet and exercise more so I had some follow up questions. If you’ve made changes to your diet and exercise habits what did you do, where did you get the information/figure it out, what was the hardest part of making the change, and what was the impact? I’m trying to find ways to motivate her and make the changes easier so she can be more consistent. Feel free to reply to every question, a few, or one!

Also, I would try to not to frame it as exercise, but just... being more active. For example, it's a good idea to walk after a meal, so why not invite your parents for a walk after dinner? 30 minutes. Hell, even 20 minutes helps (this is how I started). Understanding what to eat, how carbs affect your sugar, and how being active helps is a good start! Knowing she's not alone and that you support her is a massive help too! Good luck!
2. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=1, created=2025-10-23T17:44:37]: I second the other comment suggesting walking more. I also eat a low carb diet (but not keto or close to it - 120ish grams per day, 30-40 of which is fiber) with a lot of protein, and I take metformin, and I do strength training, and I’m hydrated as hell (lol - I have POTS which requires prioritizing hydration), but I think walking is the single biggest regulator for my BG. Something that’s been particularly helpful for me is adding the Pedometer++ step counter widget to my phone’s lock screen. I can’t avoid seeing how much (or how little) I’ve walked that day and I have hit my step goal every day since adding it. If walking is feeling boring, find something to make it more interesting - audiobooks, inviting a friend or family member, spying on the neighbors’ flowers or holiday decorations, etc etc. There’s research that as little as 2 minutes of walking within 90 minutes of a meal helps blunt BG spikes, though of course walking more than 2 minutes is better :)
3. u/Sheer-Terror-OG [score=3, created=2025-10-23T11:57:17]: My doctor gave me limited advice to exercise more, and to eat a diet including whole grains and low fat. I was diagnosed T2 about a year ago. Being honest I was in a really rough mental state for a while and gained about 50 pounds. She wanted to put me on three medications (cholesterol, insulin, and blood pressure medication.) At that time my A1C was 6.8. When I asked about should I check my blood sugar, she said no, because it may stress me out making sense of it. My feeling honestly was that she wanted to just put me on meds and be done with it, and really hasn't went out of her way to set me up for success. I am looking for a new doctor who can hopefully provide better insight to living a healthy lifestyle. What I did was I started walking 30 minutes almost every day, and then began looking at my diet. At first, I cut out junk food and began to cook more of my own meals, meaning nothing frozen out of a bag or box. I eat a very low carb diet, where my main source of carbs are from vegetables and as a guilty pleasure I eat a low carb yogurt (Too Good) is the brand. Thirteen months later, I am still learning. I walk daily, sometimes twice a day. My Siberian husky keeps me accountable as she loves her walks! I have begun to exercise regularly with the understanding that muscle mass will help to use more glucose and help to lose weight. I am down forty pounds at this point. I will mention that I am not on any medications and my last three A1C checks have been 6.4, 5.9, and 6.2. I have learned that my own body needs a lot more water than I normally drink, so I am really trying to improve on that. I do take a few supplements to help boost my efforts. What I will say is that personally that diagnosis was a soul-crusher. I felt like personally I failed myself and my family. I will fully admit that I was depressed and binge eating like each meal was my last. At this point I eat a diet of meat and vegetables, and try to limit my seasonings to salt and pepper as so many prepackaged foods have hidden sweeteners that can spike blood sugar. Currently I am in a several month weight loss stall, so I have been a bit strict. In the past month I started testing my blood sugar, out of curiosity, partially because I haven't lost any weight in so long. I wanted insight to where those numbers were. This has been a life style change for me, and honestly at this point I don't even look at sugar. Taking accountability for my physical well being has also improved my mental well being. After that very long explanation, start walking and eat a whole foods diet is a great start.
4. u/moronmonday526 [score=1, created=2025-10-23T11:25:29]: I traveled every week for work for 20 years and ate like total crap in airports, restaurants, and hotels. When I stopped traveling due to the pandemic, I needed to learn how to cook. Then, my microwave died less than a week after being told to stay home! Luckily, I had an Instant Pot sitting unopened in the box. I searched YouTube for "cheap and healthy instant pot meals." My numbers didn't drop too much. I saw a nutritionist who suggested more changes, and got my A1c down from 7.3 to 6.8. I started using a CGM a few months after that, and found more changes to make. Then I went nuts on Amazon, "buying" every free healthy cookbook I could find. I settled on a low-carb rotation for us, and got my A1c down to 5.8 after stopping my Metformin. I wrote a post outlining the steps for getting free cookbooks and what we eat during a typical month. When I say free, I mean free for a lifetime, not part of the Kindle Unlimited subscription. There's always something available to purchase at a 100% discount, and each one typically has 200 to 1,000 recipes. The sales are always changing, so keep checking. I have collected 30 cookbooks already. Here are a few that are free to me right now: * https://www.amazon.com/Diabetic-Slow-Cooker-Cookbook-Friendly-ebook/dp/B07C5CKJYX * https://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Diabetic-Cookbook-Seniors-After-ebook/dp/B0FP3R5GGD * https://www.amazon.com/Diabetic-Air-Fryer-Cookbook-Low-Sugar-ebook/dp/B0DNCTQ9Y7 * https://www.amazon.com/DIABETIC-RECIPES-COOKBOOK-Delicious-Nutrition-ebook/dp/B0BYW1N7KJ * https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Diabetic-Fryer-Cookbook-Beginners-ebook/dp/B0FLNNJBPJ Here's the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1jj61j6/cookbook_hack/ Edit: I just noticed I've been sleeping on this hack to get Mediterranean Diet cookbooks, too. There are tons of titles available right now.
5. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=1, created=2025-10-23T10:15:18]: I went to a dietitian specializing in T2D but beyond that, my endocrinologist helped but also ALOT of Google and asking questions. Learned that processes foods are not good, so I'll avoid most things at the grocery store, they are usually high in carbs, and have very little fibre. I'll but some things but read labels carefully. The only cracker I buy, for instance, is Triscuit minis. Ive also found some no sugar cookies at a Persian grocery store that are good. Reasonable carbs and calories as ling as you dont have it every day and treat it like a treat.
