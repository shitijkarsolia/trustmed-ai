===============================================================================

I just finished doing bloodwork at the doctor today, and as the title of this post says, my HbA1C is in a great place! 🥹 As a 39 y/o female with PCOS, hypertension, T2 diabetes, and endometrial cancer (a type of cancer that can be related to insulin resistance issues), I've been working really hard at this for the past few months, so I just wanted to share what I did in case it might be helpful: - Moderate carb, high protein eating style: Up to about 30-35 grams of carbohydrates per meal, so around 120 grams a day give or take depending on my snack situation that day. Protein at least 150 grams, but I’m not super strict on how much higher than that it goes. - I've been using a Freestyle Libre 2 CGM since my 11.8 HbA1C lab, and it’s made me much more aware of how foods (and food pairings!) affect my blood sugar. I still keep record of my fasting blood sugar via a fingerprick test though because I've found Libres can be a little inaccurate in the morning depending on whether or not I accidentally slept on the sensor. - Consistently (but gradually!!!) increased my step count as my way of exercise. Went from around 3,500 steps a day to 5,000, then 6,000, then 7,000, and now I do at least 10,000 steps a day broken into a 5,000 step walk in the morning and a 5,000 step walk at night. - Made sure to keep on my medication, as I used to have a hard time being organized with my medicine schedule due to depression, but obviously making sure you’re taking your meds at the right time definitely helps! - If I want to eat something that’s really carb heavy or I know will cause my blood sugar to go up by a lot, I wait until I can eat it with friends. I'm now the "Do you want to split a slice of cheesecake?" girl. Portion control, sharing food, and "saving the other half for later" keeps me from completely villainizing certain foods. Doing all of this, I lost about 18kg/40 lbs. since late February in a way that feels less like an unsustainable diet plan and more like a "Since I eat healthy 98% of the time, it’s okay to have a treat 2% of the time" realistic way to lifestyle change. Of course, every person's body, living situation, and schedule are extremely different, so this isn’t the only way to turn your health around, but I hope sharing my experience can be helpful to some of you!

I'm doing all the things you mentioned but more jogging/walking depending on the energy levels. I lost 13 kgs in 45 days, and it plateaued after that. I had a few sweets last week for Deepavali but was monitoring my glucose levels using CGM. Hoping to see similar results for myself too. Thanks for the motivating post, I am 35M by the way.
