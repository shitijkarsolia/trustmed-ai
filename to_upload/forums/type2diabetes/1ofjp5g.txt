===============================================================================

I recently started taking 5mg of Rosuvastatin and it's giving me nothing but problems. My joints all hurt, my muscles ache and I have nonstop headaches. But the worst is the neuropathy. It's so bad I can barely function, I am in constant excruciating pain from my calves to my toes. I stopped taking it for 6 days and all the pain went away so I started again hoping it wouldn't be as bad but 2 days in and I'm missurable. I cant take it anymore. I was wondering if anyone else had this happen and what did you do? Where you able to find a statin that didn't cause issues? I don't see my doctor tell end of November so for now I'm not taking it again. I had to do 6 rounds of chemo and this stuff rivals that as far as pain level goes. I am a t2 diabetic that's why I'm asking here, we all worry about neuropathy.

It did and he switched me to a different brand and dosage. I have been fine on the new statin. You should talk to your doctor ans swe if they can switch it.
3. u/tumbleweedheart [score=2, created=2025-10-25T15:36:18]: When on statins, take CoQ10 supplements. Statins deplete the CoQ10 levels, which in turn causes aches and pains. After a few weeks the pain will subside. Edited to add-- consult your physician, of course.

5. u/shrimanhiman [score=2, created=2025-10-25T04:11:56]: This is normal. Myalgia i.e. Muscle pain is a common side effect of Rosuvastatin. Consult your doctor.
6. u/slowcarbmornings [score=2, created=2025-10-25T00:25:55]: my endo said some folks metabolize rosuvastatin slower, so it builds up and causes all that muscle stuff. mine switched me to simvastatin and the pain disappeared in like two days.
7. u/RandomThyme [score=3, created=2025-10-25T00:22:36]: I have been taking itnfor nearly 3yrs and haven't had any issues with it. It would be good to call your doctors office and see if they can get you in earlier so you can get a different medication. Even if you can get an appointment it would be a good idea to let them know that you have stopped taking it and why.
8. u/MadViking-66 [score=2, created=2025-10-24T23:48:26]: I have been taking that for several months and have had no side effects. I guess I’m just lucky.
9. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=2, created=2025-10-24T23:08:19]: I take atorvistatin, I had muscle aches in my thighs and upper arms for the first week, but that was it. I think you should have your doctor call in a different statin for you. Your side effects sound debilitating.
