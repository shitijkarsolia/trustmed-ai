I have read or seen videos which indicate that berberine promotes good blood sugar management. Have you taken this food supplement and if so in what dose? Have you told your doctor about taking this supplement in addition to or instead of other medications? (It is said to replace metformin)

2. u/jackbauer24bestshow [score=3, created=2025-10-27T11:45:14]: I took Berberine (the recommended dosage for the bottle I purchased) for 3 months and saw absolutely zero change in my A1C. I already had my T2 managed at that point with diet and exercise so it was just something I thought I would try to see if I noticed any difference at all. There wasn't, so I stopped taking it.
3. u/SJgunguy24 [score=6, created=2025-10-26T13:09:26]: I take Berberine 2 times a day. I found some 3rd party tests and a youtube channel that does 3rd party testing on supplements as well. Wellbetx is the brand. 2 pills is 1000mg of berberine. When I was diagnosed as a type two diabetic in 2020. I was on 1000mg of metformin and Ozempic. I took Ozempic to get my A1C into the mid 5 range. I have since stopped all diabetic medications. The berberine is the only thing I take now. It's been 17 months off my medications, and my last 4 A1C tests have been 4.6, 4.9, 4.9, and 4.9. I exercise 6 days a week. Mostly walking, rucking with 40lbs, calisthenics (body weight exercises), and keep my carbs under 20 grams a day. I'm sure the berberine helps out with that. I'm sure my lifestyle does a lot, too. I don't want to rely on prescription medication to be healthy. I was on Ozempic for 1 year. I ended up putting on 15lbs when I got off. I have since lost that plus another 25 lbs and have gotten much stronger. I'll probably end up taking Berberine for as long as possible. I understand everyone is different. For my money, a high-quality Berberine supplement is worth it. My starting weight was 380lbs in 2020. I'm now 205 lbs and at 49. I can do pull-ups for the first time in my life.
4. u/The_Real_Nerol [score=2, created=2025-10-25T13:59:38]: I did take it until I got pregnant, honestly I'm not sure how much help it was lol but that was in addition to metformin, changing my diet, and exercise I do still take Ceylon cinnamon and alpha-lipoic acid along with some other supplements that are needed based on my blood work (B12, vitamin d, magnesium, and potassium) The diabetic counselor was so sure when I was 11 weeks pregnant that I would need insulin at some point this pregnancy, and even maternal fetal medicine warned me that yes, sometimes you just can't help it and you're not a failure if you end up needing it but I'm 32 weeks now, still very well controlled, and my A1C went from 5.4 at the start of this pregnancy to 5.1 as of 2 weeks ago. Is the cinnamon and ala helping? Who knows but I'll continue as they're not causing harm

6. u/Wall-Live [score=5, created=2025-10-25T04:35:54]: “Promotes” Look, I’ve taken it on an off. If you want to control your glucose focus on why you put in your mouth. As for does it work? No clue. I had a few years of data and there is nothing that tells me it doesn’t. How much? Now that’s the question. Nutrition Sleep Drop lbs Move That’s the recipe
7. u/Old-Fox-3027 [score=9, created=2025-10-25T01:30:10]: Medications that are regulated and have standardized doses based on research and trials are the only thing that truly works. I would never give up metformin for an unregulated supplement.
8. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=9, created=2025-10-25T01:19:45]: I've tried many supplements, none work as intended. The only thing that worked, are the actual medications. I quizzed my doctor about this, and he said that the amount of active ingredients is nowhere near what you'd need to control your blood sugar as well as actual medications do. He went on to say that, usually there is no harm in taking them (always check for interactions) but in the long-term they won't help. I do take supplements, but stuff that makes sense, like Iron (as I am deficient), B12, C, Omega 3-6-9. Good to ask! That's how you learn more about T2D and what works or doesn't.
