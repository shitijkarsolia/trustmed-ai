Hey guys! I posted on here about a week ago to get support about my recent diagnosis, and you all were absolutely the best! I started Metformin three days ago (850mg), and WOW. I have experienced head aches, nausea, and diarrhea. I take it with my dinner, when I am a little more than half way through with eating. I drink roughly 100 oz of water in a day. Does it get better? My doctor wants to increase my dosage after a month (fair), but I am so worried that I will have to start all over next month. Any tips on how to help the symptoms would be greatly appreciated!

It was one of the worst periods as far as sickness goes in my life. It got a lot better for me thankfully. I lost about 45 lbs over 5 months. I lowered my A1C from 8.6 to 5.7. I’m now off of it and just started Monjourno recently. It seems to affect everyone differently for me it was horrible constipation and nausea. Hang in there it will get better.

Of course ask your doctor mine said that it was fine. Mine were 1000mg so I basically do 500 morning and night, still 1000mg a day just not all at once. I got some pill cutter at dollar tree and it works great. I sit down and do the whole bottle of pills when I get it so I don't have to cut a pill everyday.

I've been on it a month, had bad side effects for the first 2 weeks, then started eating in order of vegetables, medicine, protein, then carb and don't normally have side effects. However, when I eat something mixed or like a soup, I still have terrible side effects.
