===============================================================================

Hi guys. A lot of you are going to be like “girl. u dumb.” And I won’t blame you. But honest, I did not know how stupid I was being until recently. Long story short, doc originally thought this was PCOS about a year ago. I immediately went keto and started exercising — felt great! Then, after the diabetes diagnosis, shit hit the fan. I didn’t realize it, but I started starving myself. I was eating low cal, exercising like BANANAS, and now I’m in a pit of trouble. I’m severely underweight, my periods have completely disappeared, and I feel like I’m hanging on a thread both mentally and physically. Has anyone here recovered from an eating disorder? I’m scared that reintroducing a lot of food will make my diabetes body/metabolism go “CODE RED” and flip out. Any advice is appreciated, though I want to point out: 1. Im in school and can’t afford therapy 2. I did message my endo but I don’t trust her full heartedly with this stuff Thank you!

What I did was eat at my maintenance calories (sometimes above) and increased my step count-- I also have ocd so slowly increasing my calorie intake whilst being active helped me maintain my weight and eased my anxiety of not being able to control my glucose. Some background info on me is that I got diagnosed with diabetes during the pandemic after getting covid, and have been managing with diet and exercise after tapering off of metformin and insulin years ago. Walking is my main form of exercise and I usually walk for more than an hour, and strength train 2-3 times a week. My latest a1c was at 4.8, and I've been walking for the past 20 months (almost daily) and have lost 50+ pounds and kept control of my diabetes off of this alone. I've recently taken up baking and cooking as a hobby and have made healthier diabetic friendly alternatives to foods and sweet treats that I like from recipes that I've come across online. What has really helped me recover the most is mindset change--because I have other health issues that I need to accommodate for (gerd and allergies), I see food as fuel to get through the day and keep my body moving. Walking and exercise in general is a hobby of mine and I learned really quickly that I won't have the best performance if I don't eat right, which makes me feel 10x worse about myself and my workout. I was diagnosed in 2021 and because of this, I just don't see the point in restricting as much as before when I'm able to control my diabetes off of minimal exercise and diet alone. Diet and exercise IS something that I had to add as a permanent lifestyle change, but it was easy to add as a lifestyle routine when knowing that I'm doing whatever I can to control my illness puts my mind at ease. When I restricted the most, I was always tired and extremely paranoid as a result--and most likely a nightmare to be around as a friend AND daughter/sister. Honestly, it all came down to perspective change and slowly reintroducing certain foods into my diet once again that helped me the most. Anytime I get paranoid about my glucose after eating something, I'll take a walk after or check my sugars and it usually eases my anxiety because most of the time, it's normal. Keeping up with my appointments and reaching out to my doctors whenever I had concerns also puts my mind at ease. Journaling is another hobby that I introduced into my life since talk therapy didn't really help me, which I started after tracking my food intake to figure out my triggers. I've also blocked certain tags online, restricted my social media usage on certain apps that triggered my ed, and because of the current state of the world--I've told myself that a little treat here and there won't hurt, especially if I get to associate said treats with nice moments (social events). Food is an important part of my culture and love language (quality time and acts of service), so it didn't feel right to always deny myself of something that I've used to bond with others. Somethings that I've learned to do is asking others if they could accommodate for my dietary restrictions (which most people have been more than happy to do), share half of what I order with others, take leftovers home for later if I really enjoy something but worry about my glucose, prepare my own meals/snacks to bring, and I always carry glucose tablets with me just in case my sugars get low. OP, I hope that you know that it is possible to recover and that you are not alone in this. It's all going to be a trial and error and I mean, it took me years to finally figure out what works for me. It took me months to realize that my over restriction was the reason why I was always tired and depressed. I used to skip hangouts because I was too tired to get out of bed only to realize that I was headed towards having multiple deficiencies and less energy to even show up for the people that I care about the most. Food started to become apart of my identity and an eating disorder was something that I did not want to be associated with, especially since people around me started to pick up on the fact that it started to become more than just a dietary restriction at that point. Taking up multiples hobbies, going to all my appointments, and spending time with the people that I care about is what helped me recover and stay at a normal weight. Although I started overweight when I got diagnosed and didn't ever come close to being underweight (but I did lose a lot of weight really fast), I had every symptom of an ED. At this stage of my life, I am too busy with work and school to see food as anything more than just fuel to get me through the day, and whenever I sense a thought to restrict myself again, I remind myself of what my life was like when I restricted, and the anxiety that came with having even more health complications as a result of over restricting. There are many alternatives to foods that are just as tasty, and won't ruin your progress or health. As long as you can fit things into your maintenance and find "safe" foods, you don't have to worry. Recovery is possible and it does get easier🐻

In the US many colleges have mental health services. I completely understand not wanting to trust your endo, but I hope you find someone professional you can trust.
