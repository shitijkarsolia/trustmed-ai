I wasn’t THAT overweight and I thought I had a pretty good diet (mostly home cooked meals, plenty of veg.) I asked my PCP to let me do some research and give me a chance, she gave me 3 mos. I’m a biology major, so the science made sense to me. Completely overhauled my diet, low carb but not keto, around 45g per day and I counted every single carb not just the bad ones. Exercise. Lost 45lbs. By my 6 mos follow-up I was down to 6.2 A1c, within a year I was under 5. No meds, no insulin. I do wear a cgm. Everything was great until May of this year, no major changes in lifestyle, my numbers just started creeping up. In June my Apple fitness app alerted me that id had a drastic shift and my avg glucose was in the 200’s!! Went to PCP, A1c was 6.9. She put me on mounjaro 2.5, very next A1c was 4.9. I’m staying on the mounjaro at the 2.5 dose, I’ve lost ten pounds and no side effects, since I already have the diet down I may not need to go up in dosage. Remission is a great idea, but it doesn’t work for everyone and it may not last forever. I’ve had doctors tell me I’m not diabetic with an A1c this low. Ha! One mini soda is all it would take to put me over 300. Find a diet/exercise plan that is sustainable for you. Take meds if you need them. You want to live your best life as long as possible, that’s my goal.

I’ve been able to drop a ton of weight and now adding more carbs to my day is not a problem, although I still stay to my diet most of the time. Low carbing and giving my system a rest started it, but for me I think losing the weight has been the biggest game changer.

My dad was just diagnosed with T2D a few months ago, and I taught him the Mediterranean diet, too, and he is also well on his way to remission. The Mediterranean diet is the key.

I start with extreme diligence, meaning I follow strictly to a low carb diet, but then, I found it unsustainable, as the food choice has become incredibly scarce. Then I move to Mediterranean diet with moderate complex carb intake and have been working till today. The thing is, it's not actually about the strict volume control of your food, but portion size and ratios. Also, some food helps your insulin sensitivity and stablise your glucose level, for example, salmon. BTW, I do strength training regularly with HIIT.
5. u/SJgunguy24 [score=3, created=2025-10-27T17:28:58]: I stopped Ozempic 17 months ago. Stopped metformin 2 months ago. I am waiting for my latest A1C test to come back. My last 4 numbers were 4.6, 4.9, 4.9, 4.9 over 2 years. I found a formula to calculate your A1C off your CGM GMI number. It says 4.9. I'm crossing my fingers that it stays in that range. All I take is 500mg of berberine 2 times a day. My glucose generally stays in the 70-100 range. It's been a long journey of 5 years to get those numbers down. I started at 8.2 in 2020.
6. u/payne51558 [score=3, created=2025-10-27T14:48:10]: Honestly I was able to do it with diet, exercise, and metformin for about 18 months. But things changed November 20th 2024. And I have not been as diligent in exercise or diet. Things are still mostly under control, no insulin. But I still need to get my head around this World at this point....
