===============================================================================

So I was diagnosed on 13th september with an A1C of 9.9, fasting glucose of 220 and postprandial of 359. I made immediate change, starting from 15th September. I only started with reducing my carb intake, and slowly added things like intermittent fasting, no snacking, more restriction on carbs, walking 10k steps a day + weight lifting, etc. During the month, my doctor also reduced my meds. I recently got my BG tested, and my fasting was 114, and my pp was 151. I also had about 38 pounds to lose, and have already dropped 15 or so of those. My doctor looked at my reports yesterday. She was kinda shocked because I've never taken my health seriously until then, and she said "the reports are really good" I feel so happy! My next goal is to get my fasting closer to 90, and my pp under 120. I think losing the remaining weight should help with that, and longer term goal is to get off meds completely.

For me- IF (16/8) was the game changer. I concentrate more on time in range than anything else. Over 90 percent now. It wasn’t always this way.
