===============================================================================

About 4 years ago his A1C was 6.5 and fasting 120. They told him he didn’t have to go on meds but to buy a meter and to change his eating and walk. He did nothing and didn’t check for 3 years. If anything he gained a few lbs instead of losing the 50 he needs to. I was sure the next time he went to the dr his A1C would be much higher but then one night I checked his blood sugar 2 hours after he ate and sundae. 2 scoops, hot fudge….his blood sugar was 120. I was sure it would be like 250. A year ago and this year his A1C is 6 and fasting around 112. The only thing he did was take more supplements. Berberine being one of them. How has he not gotten any worse? I’m happy he didn’t but just wondering. I don’t think Berberine would change things that much. I exercised for years and my A1C was 10.9. I got it down to 5.4 but with Mounjaro and eating less carbs.

I say it here periodically but people on Reddit seem to be very averse to natural and alternative medicine. All you’re missing out on are the side effects if you choose Berberine over Metformin.
2. u/SJgunguy24 [score=2, created=2025-10-30T11:52:01]: Berberine is good stuff. That's the only thing I take now and my A1C has been in the high 4's for 2 years.
3. u/gertymoon [score=5, created=2025-10-30T09:12:38]: Berberine acts like a metformin so that could explain some of it but I'd hand it to good genetics. As he ages though it could get worse but his doctor is monitoring it.

5. u/Right_Independent_71 [score=3, created=2025-10-30T05:09:12]: Seems like there could be a number of unknown factors here, but I'd take it as a blessing and make changes now to take advantage of the good luck.
