Hi everybody (non traditional post here)! I have a unique opportunity to get in front of leadership at a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) company. I want to have YOUR voices heard! I’d be SO appreciative if ya’ll commented here by sharing something such as…. “It would be really great if CGM companies would…..” “I wish CGM companies would……” If possible, let’s frame these as solutions (rather than complaints because they have a ton of info on complaints). For example….”It would be really great if CGM companies would send a spare CGM automatically when one fails because....” I have A LOT of feedback already on insurance/cost as that's the MAIN frustration, so if possible, I'd love to hear feedback around 'usability of a CGM (tutorials, how to get started), access to customer support channels, more education about the CGM data it provides and how that translates to real life decisions, etc. For any skeptics out there, I'd be happy to share my LinkedIn profile, so you can vet me - I am a real person, with this real opportunity and want to include real feedback

1. u/mo4620 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T15:57:13]: I agree with the other comment about the apps needing some serious work. My Dexcom app shows a history but doesn't give me a way to look back historically, so I need a different app to actually see trends. It also doesn't let me interact with the chart to see specific values (for example, just how high WAS that last spike?), so I need another app for that too. As someone who works in software development, it's frustrating because I know the data is there - but I'd love having more access to it within the app. I'd even be willing to pay a monthly fee for that, if it had the right features. I would also really love an app for my Fitbit so I can check my values at a glance without having to pull out another device. As far as I know, there's only one way to get that info on my Fitbit and it's via an outdated and ugly watch face that I have never been able to actually connect to my Dexcom. At the end of the day, both of these "wish list" items are focused on ways to do more with the date my CGM is collecting and sending out. Real-time feedback is important, but so is trend analysis. The easier that analysis is, the more informed my decisions become.

3. u/Dangerous-Agent-9017 [score=1, created=2025-11-07T07:29:36]: It would be great if cgm companies included more than 1 over patch especially on a 10 day cgm. It would also be great if all cgm’s were 15 day. It would be great if the cgm companies had a lobbist and people communicating with the American Diabetes Association to campaign that all diabetic treatments, not just insulin would benefit from a cgm.

5. u/davebrutusbrown [score=1, created=2025-10-30T21:41:17]: This post sure caught my attention. I love what you’re doing, and would love to talk with you about what you’re learning. I would be shocked if Dexcom or Abbott is flexible on pricing, but I do think insurance companies need to hear frequent and loud demands from the consumers who pay them - especially if presented with evidence that covering CGMs will contribute to their net profits. (I think that argument can be made)
6. u/RandomThyme [score=3, created=2025-10-30T13:31:30]: Their apps definitely need way more work. I use the Libre 2 and the app is just sad. The free app for the Contour Next meter is better than the one for libre. I would really like to be able to track oral medications along side the long &amp; short acting insulin. With so many t2s using these meters now this would be a great thing to add. Maybe some additional functionality for adding meals or at least the ability to save frequently eaten meals, would make carb counting much easier.
7. u/HistoricalReason8631 [score=3, created=2025-10-30T12:14:56]: On their app (I have a Dexcom 6) I’d love to be able to write in what I eat, not just how many carbs. Bonus if there was a way for it to analyze what foods stabilize/ spike.
