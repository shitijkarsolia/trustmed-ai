I just read an article about this in the NYT. Since that’s behind a paywall, here’s the study it’s referencing: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547 TLDR: there’s a correlation between taking longer walks (as in, 15 minutes or longer) to get steps in and better health outcomes, vs many shorter walks (5min or shorter). Perhaps nothing groundbreaking but I found it interesting. I know many of us here looooove data analysis lol.

2. u/Firehand73 [score=6, created=2025-10-31T01:26:24]: It’s interesting — I’ve noticed for myself that walking for at least 20 minutes after eating makes a real difference. My blood sugar spikes are much smoother, and by now I actually don’t want to go without this kind of movement anymore.
