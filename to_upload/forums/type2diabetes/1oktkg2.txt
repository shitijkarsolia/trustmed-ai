===============================================================================

I gave a talk at a conference yesterday. It was by far the best I’ve been at a conference in probably a year! It felt really good and I got great feedback. A few hours later I checked my CGM to see where I was before I ate lunch and saw the giant spike. What’s really funny is it follows the pacing of the talk! The top of the peak is pretty much to the minute when I took all the things I discussed and explained how they’re related. It’s the “impact” moment. I’m not worried about it because it came right back down, but it is really funny to see that the thing that spikes me the most (stress and adrenaline) are the 1 thing I literally can’t control. Also learned the lesson that I need to pay more attention to the crash after. Went back to my hotel room after a few hours of being at the conference, sat down and my blood sugar plummeted.

Our livers then fire off some stored glucose to help us to deal with the situation. Mental worrying can trigger the same response. The livers release of sugar while waking up, the dawn effect, is also from a cortisone release.
