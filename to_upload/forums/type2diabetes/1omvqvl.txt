5. u/hu_gnew [score=5, created=2025-11-02T16:38:40]: I use La Banderita brand Carb Counter tortillas. They're made with resistant wheat and potato starches, which I tolerate well while others may experience spikes. What I can't eat is Mission Carb Balance, made with modified starches, because they spike me terribly. But heck, you may be able to tolerate both of them. Once I figured out how modified starches affect me I've begun to reject any food that lists them as ingredients. I'm still careful when eating resistant starches but I *can* have a large enough serving to make it worthwhile. I'll usually have two 8" La Banderita tortillas with a meal, which is plenty after all the veggies I started off with. BTW, the La Banderita tortillas have nearly the same taste and feel as a regular flour tortilla. They don't make me think I'm compromising.
