Many people notice glucose levels jumping unexpectedly even when meals and routines stay the same. Some say stress, sleep, or even weather can throw numbers off. What patterns or hidden triggers have you discovered behind these unpredictable spikes?

I think the sudden movement from sitting in an office chair for a few hours to getting up and heading out to the subway causes a response, but I don’t think it’s uncommon for people to experience a little blood spike when doing something active. It usually ends up helping it go down in the long run.

I exercise. I just don't get spikes, partly because I am retired and not subjected to stress. I retired early because I realized how badly the stress at work was affecting my health.

I’ll eat a piece of candy and have amazing numbers. Not all the time. But I was also just diagnosed with hEDS, MCAS, and disautonomia. Wondering is that has any bearing on blood sugar.
