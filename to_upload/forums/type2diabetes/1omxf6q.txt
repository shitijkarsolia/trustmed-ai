Hi all! I have come to the recent realization that I am *too* active. I’ve been trying to be kinder to my body and am resetting some goals to avoid injuries/too much weight loss/etc. As far as steps go, how many do you usually aim for? On days where I do strength training, I don’t typically worry about it. Thanks in advance!

My last A1C was 5.2. I eat 20 grams or less of very complex carbohydrates each day. I exercise. I have a room where I exercise so my exercise routine is not effected by weather. I am retired. I have time to exercise.

I exceed it most days, by a dramatic margin sometimes, but I’ve had Achilles tendinitis issues and knee issues in the past so I try not to go too wild with it. Walking 5-8k daily is better for me than walking a lot more too often and then not be able to walk at all while I recover from an injury flare up. I also do strength training 2 or 3 days a week, as well as have a rebounder/mini trampoline and a stationary bike which are both low impact.
