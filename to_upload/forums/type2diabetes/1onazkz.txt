Hi all! I have been anxiously awaiting my first repeat hbA1c results all weekend and they just came in and felt a need to share with a group that would understand ,😍 A brief summary, I am 42f and was diagnosed with (presumed) T2 in July this year. I had my bloods done following a wound on my toe that wasn't healing well, I had no other symptoms at all and my BMI is 23. My hbA1c results in July were 107 which was obviously a huge shock and really concerning. I have health anxiety as well so to go from thinking I was well to thinking I was really not well was a massive adjustment, as well as the barrage of medical appointments that followed. I started treatment with Metformin straight away, was offered Glicazide as well but decided to try sort out my diet first and ended up not taking it at all. I didn't do anything particularly scientific with my diet but worked hard to reduce my carb in take in general and cut out obviously sugary foods/drinks. I haven't been able to focus too much of losing weight as my weight wasn't considered high anyway, but I have of course noticed changes. I self funded CGMs for 2 months which really helped my understanding my trends and which combinations of foods worked best for me (i.e. protein!). 3 months on and my repeat hbA1c today came back as 47. I know I still need to continue working hard and get it lower, but I am so happy to have made this much progress in 3 months. It just feels good I guess to have some positive news on this front after a difficult few months, and it helps me feel like the work and changes are worth it. I am still very much at the beginning of my journey but wanted to share so far.
