===============================================================================

So I’ve been having my struggles trying to find the perfect pair of slip on shoes to combat my neuropathy. Thank god for Amazon’s liberal return policy but damn I’d really like to find a pair of shoes that is comfortable and doesn’t kill my feet. It probably doesn’t help that I also have flat feet so throw in orthotics to make me really feel like I’m hunting a unicorn while also trying to stay around the $50 mark. I’ve found that the Skechers slip ons get me the closest while also staying in my price range. The only problem is the normal sizing is a bit too tight on the front of my foot. And if I go with the wide or x-wide version it’s too loose around my ankle and my foot just slops around in the shoe. Anyone else in a similar boat as I am that was able to find a shoe that feels like wrapping your feet in soft velvety goodness?

Because perhaps a 1/2 or 3/4 orthotic would help there. I also wonder if you've tried going up a half size. I have small feet so this does not help most people but as a 6.5 in women's, I can wear girls 4 and 4.5. I currently have 4 pairs of girls and 2 women's and straight out of the box the girls have more support (also totally flat feet) and more cushioning, and bonus they go on sale more often, so I pay closer to $30/pair. I have been wearing them so long I can say some small differences in the patterns can really change the toe box fit. I don't like the ones with fake laces vs elastic that looks more like a design, it's tighter when it looks like laces... But that could be what you need to keep the fit tighter around your ankle. I just think life is better with rainbows, fun colors and even glitter on my feet that's so easily washed because I also do not do socks.

My late husband was hard to fit, too, and they took a mold of his feet and made a custom pair. Just a thought. I wear skechers slip ins too, but it sounds like you're really struggling.

9. u/dafrog84 [score=5, created=2025-11-03T20:08:25]: I love my Fila's, memory foam arch support, I use different laces that are kinda like a hair tie. I've had neuropathy in my feet for over 10 years. The doctors told me I probably wouldn't walk again. Was in a bad auto crash, smashed both my legs from the knee down. I will probably never feel my toe's again. It took me two years to walk again. But the doctors keep saying just make sure I wear shoes always when walking. For me I need the support of the arch built-in. I shop the Fila outlet mall website. But I also know what I want and what size. If I get anything else I end up with lower back pain that will move on all the way up to my shoulders. Last years black Friday sale was off the hook. Buy one pair got two free. So I brought 2 pairs and got 4 free. It's a win for me because that's over a years worth of shoes for me. I still have two pairs waiting to be worn. And black Friday is coming.
