Hey all, Three months ago my HbA1c was 10.2, and I honestly thought I was done for. Always tired, always hungry, always blaming my glucometer 😅. Then I decided to stop overthinking and just do the basics right: Monitored my sugar daily — pre and post meals. Painful but eye-opening. I used CGM during twice - 2weeks at the start of diet plan and 2 weeks just before testing Other days, I was checking using finger pricks, daily morning. Cut carbs (bye white rice, we had a good run). Ate real food: eggs, grilled chicken, grilled salmon, veggies, dal, and millets. Intermittent fasting: 8 PM to 12 PM — tough at first, then oddly freeing. Walked 60–90 mins daily. Some days longer. I stopped chasing “perfect numbers” and started chasing consistency. And it worked: ➡️ HbA1c: 10.2 → 5.6 ➡️ Weight: 92 kg → 78 kg ➡️ Energy: finally not powered by caffeine alone ☕ Still enjoy the occasional biryani (because life), but now I understand what my body can handle. If you’re starting out — don’t wait for motivation. Just start small, stay consistent, and your numbers will follow. 💪

I know this is pretty low in comparison to seeing some of everyone else’s A1c levels when they were diagnosed so I asked my doctor if I could try out with diet and exercise for three months and see if I could lower it naturally without medication and she okayed that I’m currently three weeks in did a complete cold turkey cut carbs cut sugar I even cut out all caffeine. I only drink water and I am now doing intermittent fasting and in three weeks I’ve lost 24 pounds. However I know that’s gonna slow down and I am very obese at 370 pounds so I know it’s gonna slow down and so forth but I’m really happy with what I’ve accomplished so far and really praying that when I get my next A1c test in January that it will have taken me out of the diabetic range and hopefully into pre-diabetic range or even into non-diabetic, but I just want to see an improvement on it

I believe they do give the newly diagnosed some perspective and hope because I know when I first found out I thought my life was over, but finding posts like these gave me a foundation of real time cases to reframe my mind. There are hundreds of people with success stories but they're not posted often. On the other hand are some tuff questions and experiences that require some shared information so those tend to be the posts that tips the scale. I did 12.4 to 6.0 in 3 months without any use of meds. Next A1C is coming up in December. To start out I did have constant urination which went away 2-3 days after diagnosis and blurry vision lasted 1-2 weeks. Nothing has shown up since. Feet tests and eye scans are all great. Test panels are all great now. Breakfast is usually a protein shake of some kind or something lite but with lots of protein. Lunch and dinner however is a whole surprising story for "my journey" I typically have 100-125+ grams of carbs in each of those meals. A month or so into diagnosis when I started testing meals the numbers have always been surprising. I still record everything to share with my doctor. Yesterday for lunch I had a chicken sandwich, veggies, sauces etc and 3 medium sized chocolate chip cookies. Baseline before was: 4.7 mmol 30 min: 7.2 mmol 1 hr: 7.0 mmol 1.5 hr: 6.0 mmol 2 hr: 6.0 mmol 2.5 hr 5.4 mmol Dinner was eaten around 8pm from a restaurant called poulet rouge. A pretty mixed meal including rice and veggies, chicken, corn, beans, cheese,..etc. I didn't collect my readings for this as I had to get my son to bed. I woke up this morning 4.8 mmol. (7:30 AM) Hopefully this information is helpful for someone. Test everything and collect data for how your body is processing and handling. It's truly different for everyone.

9. u/Dry-Wolf6789 [score=4, created=2025-11-05T00:12:51]: 🚨i know people like to celebrate these posts but i always just want to caution that dropping your A1C more than 2 points within a few months can cause treatment induced neuropathy which is PAINFUL as fuck and can be a nightmare and last years. It can also worsen retinopathy. everyone please be careful and listen to the dr &lt;3 &lt;3 AND congrats OP on the hard work !
