Hi apart from helping to treat type 2 diabetes (it has been offered to me) did anyone notice an improvement in osteoarthritis pain ? I have heard it may and it would be an added benefit .Thankyou

The strength of the research is very different on different benefits but overall for people that don’t have severe gut reactions to it, it seems really beneficial.

I’m not sure if this is a direct action of the medication or a secondary effect of helping control my BG better - I would guess the latter but haven’t looked into it deeply.
