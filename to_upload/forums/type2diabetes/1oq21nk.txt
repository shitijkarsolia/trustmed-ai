===============================================================================

I am 38 and was diagnosed T2D in early October. A1C 7.8. I immediately changed my diet and exercise. I eat very limited carbs (less than 50g a day is the goal but it ends up being less than 30). No alcohol. I have been extremely strict. My numbers still are so random. For example, last night...I went to bed at 108, woke up at 152. I did not eat or drink a single thing after 9 PM other than water. This is what happens every night. Sometimes I will spike after eating something with very few carbs, like a serving of zucchini, ground beef, and cheese with a total of 5g carbs (not net carbs, I mean total, and it all came from zucchini) and 2 hours later my blood sugar has spiked to 180. I can't get in to see an endocrinologist for another month and I'm going crazy. I am dreaming about food. The metformin has me crapping straight water. I'm on metformin and my fasting numbers are crap, and I'm spiking at the smallest amount of carbs. Does this get better? Do I have any hope of ever eating a carb again? I have had to so drastically change what I eat and my numbers are still a mess so I don't know what to do. Like I said, I can't get in to an endo for another month. Losing my effing mind and sad because I am working REALLY hard.

Cortisol will tell your body that you are in danger and Mr. Liver will give more glucose to your blood for energy, since you can't digest glucose well now it stays up. First for God sake calm down. Give this thing sometime, understand your body and let it adjust to your new lifestyle. Keep walking and stay active and yes chill for peace. You will be completely alright in 6 months the way you are managing your diet. In 6 months you will discover a lot and then you keep talking to your body. Morning sugar is spiking due to dawn phenomena which starts roughly at 4 Am in order to wake you up. Mr. Liver again dumps sugar to get you ready for the day however since again you can't handle sugar well now it takes time to come down. As the months will progress you will start getting better I promise you. You main cause right now is stress vicious circle. Stress causes spike and spike causes stress in you. If you are wearing a CGM then clearly you are going crazy on it. I will recommend to go for finger pricks for few weeks and would not sit on cgm numbers at all because it is clearly stressing you out. Hope it helps, it helped me , i was anxious myself just like you.....

I actually had to stop and restart it. With Dr approval of course. My stomach finally stopped killing me after a few weeks, and my numbers are finally evening out. It gets better. I got an OTC stelo cgm so I could really understand how different foods and exercise affect me. Now I’m at a 6.9, I got put on ozempic and I got a dexcom script, in the hopes of continuing to go in the right direction. Things do get better, it just takes a while unfortunately

Yes, you will be able to handle some more carbs once your bod has had a chance to heal a bit and regain some insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. HOWEVER you’ll likely never be able to eat carbs with abandon and must keep an eye that you don’t undo your progress and results by slipping into old habits

6. u/FustianRiddle [score=3, created=2025-11-06T14:52:33]: If you're dreaming about food I worry about you being too restrictive in your eating. That's often a sign of disordered eating and is unsustainable in the long term. Remember stress can drive those numbers up too so stressing about this will only work against you. Add in some small amounts of exercise. Remember this is a marathon not a sprint. Be kind to yourself.
7. u/SJgunguy24 [score=4, created=2025-11-06T11:41:11]: Stick with it. It works. It takes time for your body to heal. It took all your life to get this bad. It will take time to get better. A little advice from a dude who's been there and still working at it. Stop eating 3 hours before bed. 6 if you're able to do it. Take a 20 min walk after eating. Drink some apple cider vinegar 30 min before you eat. Make sure you dilute it in water. My A1C was 8.2 5 years ago. The lowest while on metformin was 4.6. I'm off all my meds, except I take Berberine 2 times a day. I work nights, so my schedule is all ways messed up. My last 4 A1C tests have been under 5. No meds, and I exercise like my life depends upon it. Try what I recommend, please. It will help. Remember to play the long game. You're 38 and still young. I'm 49 and went from 375lbs to 205lbs. It's chess, not checkers. I haven't had any carbs in a couple years. I don't miss them at all.
8. u/Obvious_Dog_7082 [score=6, created=2025-11-06T10:26:30]: This may sound silly but I was having consistently high numbers in the morning as well and someone told me to eat a small amount of protein and take my last dosage of metformin before bed. Now my morning numbers have decreased significantly.
9. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=1, created=2025-11-06T09:56:26]: What worked yesterday is not a guarantee that it will work today. Keep that in mind-managing this disease is difficult. There is a spike of some sort every time you eat, that’s perfectly normal. What’s more important is how quickly that spike returns to your baseline. They say 2 hours. But it can and should come down much faster. That’s when you know that you are controlling t2D. Focus more on the amount of time you are within range. 70 percent is suggested. No snacking! In fact, consider intermittent fasting. That gives your body a rest. Lots of info available about the benefits of a type two diabetic an intermittent fasting
10. u/Anthropogenic12 [score=5, created=2025-11-06T08:54:34]: My advice is to stop worrying about the morning numbers: that's normal for a lot of us. I never even test in the morning any more, because it's always artificially high. It's called Dawn Phenomenon, and it's your body pumping you full of things to wake you up. Metformin water shits: you need slow release Metformin. It happened to me, too. Easy fix. Blood sugar rises: there are dozens of factors over and above what we eat which can push up blood sugar. The big one is stress. The more stressed you are the more glucose will be pumped out in to your blood. The same goes for a lack of sleep and not getting enough water. Rest, relax and hydrate. Eating carbs again: yes and no. I'm three years in and I stopped missing carbs two and a half years ago. I probably could eat some now, but it never crosses my mind to. The goal is consistency in low blood sugar readings; once the sugar is low and level, the body can begin to handle a few bits here and there. Try some things out, and see how your body reacts.
11. u/Frosty-Prune-206 [score=8, created=2025-11-06T08:45:54]: Well first of all, it sounds like you already are getting better. A1C of 7.8% works out to an average of 177, so if you’re seeing low 100s before you go to sleep you’re probably well on your way to lowering your A1C. That said, you’re not going to have perfect numbers after only a month. Don’t get discouraged. It also sounds like you have dawn phenomenon issues, with your BG rising so much in the morning. I would suggest reading about that if you haven’t. Are you on the extended release metformin? That can help with the GI side effects. Something else that helps is physical activity. Taking a short walk after a meal and getting into a regular strength training routine can help your BG numbers immensely. You’ll often see a little spike right after vigorous exercise but overall increased activity and muscle mass will help control your BG by making you better at using insulin.
