Ok semglee is out of stock so my doctor put me on Trasiba neither work well for me at all. I’ve been taking trasiba for 3 weeks it sucks. I get the predawn phenomenon starting at like 4am my Bs slowly rises all the way up to 8 am. I’ve been taking it right before bed. Don’t work period! So I’ve been taking my rapid acting if I’m not in my desired range works better. I do understand type 2 is more insulin resistant as well . Has this happened to anyone else??

I know everyone is different but it feels like I’m injecting water.
3. u/RandomThyme [score=3, created=2025-11-07T06:39:52]: I take Tresiba and it works way better for me than Basaglar did, currently on 24u before bed. Perhaps your dose isnt high enough. I also struggle with higher numbers in the morning. Mune tend to start rising when I get out of bed and continue until I eat breakfast. Good when I wake up (according to my CGM) but by the time I test in the morning I'm sitting between 8.0mmol and 9.0mmol. Personally, if my morning numbers are pushing me out of being &gt; than 70% TIR and my A1c is ia around 6.5% (46) I really don't worry about it. How long since you have been diagnosed? Morning numbers can be stubborn and are often the last thing to improve. Somethings that you can try to see if they help are: - having a protein based snack before bed - having breakfast earlier - having less carbs at dinner - getting enough sleep - managing stress
