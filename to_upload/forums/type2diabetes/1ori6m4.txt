I've mostly fasted for the past 4 days and only eaten carrots and drank black tea but I'm still getting blurry vision and cold hands. I got diabetes a month ago.

You have probably had it WAY longer than that and just now realized it I am sure from a Doctor visit? what was your A1C level? Carrots and black tea not going to pull you out of it. maintain a healthy diet. good luck

Are you testing? &gt; I got diabetes a month ago. What dietary advice have you had from your medical advisors? I wrote this to help you begin: [Getting Started](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com.au/2006/10/d-day.html). I know you will have lots of questions after you read that and the pages it links to. Come back and ask them all.

Your body is like a machine and the machine runs on fuel like eggs, meat, fish, cheese,some veggies that are low on the glycemic scale. Until you get your blood sugars in line it will be trial and error. Hubby still eats potatoes but not as frequent, rice too and he makes our bread so its not ultra processed. 2 meals a day with 2 snacks a day. He used to test 4 times a day and is now down to morning and before dinner. Eat some cheese, have some good lunch meat as a snack. Don't be afraid to try different food. Keep a journal of the time, food eaten and the BG numbers, that will help you see what works for you.

5. u/CuriousMe6987 [score=5, created=2025-11-08T08:38:30]: Also, when I tried intermittent fasting, my blood sugars were super high, even after not eating for 6-8 hours....my liver would kick in and boost my blood sugar. You may be better off with, small, frequent, high protein, low carb, high fiber meals. Nuts are a great component of these kinds of small meals.
6. u/k_princess [score=3, created=2025-11-08T07:39:44]: Carrots have carbs. I eat them all the time, but in moderation because that's what works for my body. You need to find a better balance of what works for you. And fasting for religious purposes does not necessarily mean fasting from food, if that is why you are fasting. My church leaders are adamant about this. Many of our congregation have health issues and need reliable food sources so going without food isn't feasible.
7. u/rerco08 [score=8, created=2025-11-08T07:25:11]: Carrots have a lot of carbs. You need to eat a balanced diet diet with low sugar and carbs
8. u/Pedal2Medal2 [score=9, created=2025-11-08T06:05:46]: You didn’t “get” Diabetes a month ago, it was just found. Depending on how often you got blood tests, visited your Dr., you’ve had it for a while. Are you on medication? You desperately need to eat a healthy, low carb diet, not fast on carrots &amp; tea
9. u/ephcee [score=12, created=2025-11-08T04:54:26]: You’re not eating a healthy diet, so yeah your body is going to act weird. You may even notice your hair starting to fall out more than it should soon and you might find you lack energy. Just eat a normal, healthy diet. You’ll be fine.
10. u/Carlito2393 [score=3, created=2025-11-08T04:20:49]: Its pretty simple. Eat whole foods only. No processed foods. Meats and veggies. If you want potatoes or rice, cook it and refrigerate it. After they've been chilling for a while, you can reheat and eat them. This charges the starch so you don't process it as quickly (resistant starch). A few of the resources on YouTube I use are Dr. Jason Fung, Dr. Eric Berg, and The Glucose Goddess. Exercise.
11. u/egg1st [score=4, created=2025-11-08T01:31:34]: Diabetes is a horrible disease and it can be very confusing over what you eat or don't eat and how it impacts you, and why it impacts you. Without diabetes your body is able to handle whatever you eat between the pancreas releasing insulin and your liver breakdown down fat into glucose (if I remember correctly). Diabetes essentially limits what your pancreas can do to help balance out your blood sugars with insulin. Which means you need to balance your blood sugars manually by controlling what you eat and what you do. Low blood sugar is dangerous. High blood sugar is dangerous. That's why having a way to monitor your current blood sugar level is important, because you know what you need to correct for. Too high, exercise and hydrate, avoid all carbs but still take on calories. Too low, eat something balanced. Far too low, eat some sweets/candy. Most people find that an Atkins diet works well as a baseline, as you're getting the calories you need to function, whilst keeping the carbs low. Carbs basically equals sugars. Understanding nutrition helps a lot with managing diabetes. There's lots of information out there. I found the book by Professor Roy Taylor very useful for me in understanding how I can control and reverse the effects of diabetes. My recommendation for you is (not a doctor) 1) get a blood glucose monitor - finger prick test 2) widen your diet to follow Atkins 3) learn about nutrition and diabetes
12. u/Still-Bee3805 [score=5, created=2025-11-08T00:40:17]: Carrots are not the best choice. They are a carb- although a good carb, they are sweet. You didn’t just “get” diabetes, it builds quietly in your body. Now that you have a diagnosis, it’s time to learn about the disease. Start with watching utube videos.
13. u/chanakya2 [score=9, created=2025-11-07T23:49:55]: Blurred vision and cold hands could be due to low blood pressure. If you are not eating enough calories then your body will start to shut down. You need to find a qualified dietician and work with them to find a good meal plan. One carrot has about 25-30 calories. To get enough calories from just carrots in a day you need close to 2,000 carrots.
14. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=7, created=2025-11-07T23:37:59]: Do you have a Glucometer? Are you checking your levels or just going off of how you feel? What you're doing isn't sustainable or healthy. Please do some research on diabetic diets and eat some real food.
15. u/catsandplants424 [score=15, created=2025-11-07T23:36:19]: Carrots and tea aren't going to fix your problems. You need to eat actual food. Eat protein, low carb veggies and healthy fats. Depending in your diet you could also be very nutrient deficienct so it will take time got your body to repair the damage already done but you need to eat more then carrots for that too happen
