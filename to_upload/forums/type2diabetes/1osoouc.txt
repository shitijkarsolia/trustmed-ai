What’s everyone’s thoughts on Lantus? I’ve been taking it for….honestly not sure how long. But it doesn’t seem to work for me…..matter of fact, I recently stated thinking it’s the problem why I still struggle with my diabetes. My doctor had increased it from 40 to 42 units. And I feel a little more hungry which makes it harder to resist foods and portions I know I shouldn’t have. And my sugar is a a little higher. Could explain why my Ozempic isn’t working at full dose? Anyways I was just wondering if this was just me or if anyone else has the same issue with Lantus?

1. u/Ischarde [score=1, created=2025-11-11T06:33:24]: I was on a high dose of Lantus to begin with, 100 units a day that was over a year ago while I was still drinking sodas and eating stuff I shouldn't have. I'm now down to 36 units, 20 during the day, 16 at night because I go low. I stopped the sodas and drink mostly water. I've also cut out potatoes, rice and white bread. More protein in my diet. And I mostly eat one meal a day. Oh and 1 mg of Ozempic. And I'm on a sliding scale for my Novalog fast acting insulin. It's finally working for me, my A1C is finally out of double digits but it's a lot of work.
2. u/throwawayaccount931A [score=2, created=2025-11-10T00:45:34]: I've been on it for years, but initially it didn't work because my diet was waaay out of whack. I was eating too many carbs, not enough protein. Once I started IF (14/10 or 16/8) and cut down my carbs to 100g per day (or less) the Lantus helped. I went from 40+ units per day to 10 per meal (or 20-24 units/day). I used my medication + insulin as a crutch, so of course it didn't work. Once I got my carbs under control the Lantus did its thing.
3. u/rggladfe [score=2, created=2025-11-10T00:02:55]: I have been taking it 6mos. My blood sugar average has gone from 350 to 150. My A1C dropped from 8.4 to 6.3. I also have been taking Mounjaro currently at 10mg. I see slight after meal spikes but they always come right back down.
4. u/Maleficent_Bit2033 [score=0, created=2025-11-09T23:42:49]: It didn't do anything for me. I stopped taking it for 3 months right after my A1C test and at my next test there was no change. My numbers were in range for both tests. There was only a . 1 difference in the test and the second one was the lower. Haven't touched Lantus since. My numbers are still consistent 6 months later.

Possibly the problem is not your meds or insulin. They are an aid to an appropriate way of eating but cannot counter a bad diet. What dietary advice are you following in terms of carbs, fats and protein per meal or per day? What do you consider "a little higher" for blood glucose?

I started Lantus a lil over a month ago. It is definitely helping with my overnight numbers, fasting numbers,and my in between meal numbers. However, it’s not really helping my after meal spikes.
8. u/leeloodallas93 [score=-1, created=2025-11-09T12:15:51]: I’m trying to switch. I’ve been on it 4 or 5 pens worth. However many come in a package. Anyways got my dose up to 30. Nothing but weight gain and blood sugar almost never under 200. This morning my fbs was 243 and I barely ate yesterday. I was on a different insulin when I was first diagnosed and it was much better. I was down around 105. I know nothing other than no sugar barely any carbs. Drink water and exercise. Dx’d august 2025. AIC 14
