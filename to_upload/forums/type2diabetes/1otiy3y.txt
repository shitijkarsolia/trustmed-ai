2. u/SuspiciouslyDullGuy [score=1, created=2025-11-10T12:25:51]: If you mean can an ice tea affect the lipid panel result, the blood test for cholesterol and triglycerides, then so long as there's no fat in it - creamer or milk - then no. Ingesting fat before the test can raise the triglyceride result a bit, which is why the blood test should be done in the fasted state. If you mean can sugar raise triglycerides in general - not any more than any other carb. Excess carbs in the blood after a meal, in a person with insulin resistant muscle tissue, are largely converted to fat in the liver. The liver then pumps that fat into the blood as triglycerides, evenly over the day. The same goes for protein and to some extent fat in meals though so the effects of diet on triglycerides aren't something to worry much about. If you're overweight and have elevated triglycerides the single most effective thing you can do about it is to lose weight.
3. u/philq76 [score=1, created=2025-11-10T11:23:09]: I have high triglycerides and T2D and I take fenofibrate for the triglyerides, which is typically a genetic predisposition and not so much related to diet/ exercise as the other cholesterols. A regular cholesterol medication, like Lipitor (statin) will moderately help triglycerides, if they aren't super high, but aren't a good long term solution if your other cholesterols are in line. Controlling the diabetes along with fenofibrate has made a huge impact on my tri numbers. I had acute pancreatitis once as well for super high triglyerides (1100+) and that's when I started on the fenofibrate. Now they are down to under 100 consistently. Long post to say that you shouldn't be drinking sweet tea with T2D anyway. Had a friend who found out he was diabetic from drinking too much sweet tea and almost died because he went into a diabetic coma.

5. u/gigi79sd [score=1, created=2025-11-10T10:10:46]: Yes. The body covers excess sugar into triglycerides.
