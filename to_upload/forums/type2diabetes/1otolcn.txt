===============================================================================

Well, it's been a month since my diagnosis, and while my blood sugar levels are fine, I know it's not because of my own effort, and I really need to vent, but I'd better give some context. If you're wondering if I still eat sweets, it's only sometimes, probably due to the insulin toujeo or medications like metformin and diamicron(Gliclazide). My blood sugar is usually low when I wake up, between 79 and 90. When it's at 60 (which rarely happens), I usually eat something sweet to raise my sugar a little and prevent it from dropping, like a few small Twix bars, a waffle with sugar, or some juice. In fact, I want to share a anecdote that happened to me last Wednesday. When I woke up and had my blood sugar checked, it was 73, and I was a little relieved that it wasn't at 60. For breakfast, because I had to get to school quickly (it's my last year of school, if you're wondering), I only ate about three sugar-free cookies and drank unsweetened milk. Before leaving, I took my three medication pills, but I decided to bring something sweet in case my blood sugar dropped. At school, I felt confused and tired, and I got scared. I thought my blood sugar was low, so I decided to eat my sugar cookies to see if I would feel better. And well, in the end, I did, but I was still worried. In the cafeteria, I ate a breaded chicken and two balls of mashed potatoes. I didn't have a choice; it was all there was, so I decided to eat just one plate. When I got home, I decided to rest a bit. Unfortunately, I didn't have time for my daily walk because I had to take care of my younger siblings. Luckily, I had gym class today, and I actually ran a lot. Then I injected my insulin at the time I usually do (at 6:00 PM; I live in Belgium, if you're wondering). Then I played video games to try to forget about food, and before going to sleep, I took my second blood test, and it was 77. That surprised me; it's usually between 90 and 110. Once in 114, and especially because I ate several sugary foods at different times (the cookies I mentioned before, and a small croissant when I got home), sometimes I'm grateful I still have my insulin injection Yes… I know everyone on this subreddit is right, I know I have to stick to my diet, because I still eat pizza (a whole one and surprisingly it didn't raise my blood sugar much, I even expected my insulin wasn't enough), and snacks (only when my blood sugar is under control… at least I'm exercising (I hope my one-hour walk is enough), and I know that maybe I don't have to use my daily insulin injection and use medications like metformin and diamicron (I know it's only been a month since my diagnosis and maybe I'll have this for months or years) forever. But the thing is… this way I feel like a normal person and not like a sick person, I still have the guilt and the shame of having diabetes. At 20 years old, I still cry every day since my diagnosis, and I've realized how much my diabetes has affected me emotionally. I'm even crying as I write this. I know it's possible I developed it earlier because of my genetics (my dad's family was full of diabetics,he takes care of himself, and in fact, he and my mom try to support me). I try to be positive, no matter if I try to exercise, fast, or eat healthy, because I know it's because of my insulin and medication that my blood sugar is controlled. I haven't noticed many changes, and that worries me a lot because I think I'll never be able to go into remission, even if I try really hard, because I'm a total failure and my life is ruined forever… I know it sounds ridiculous, but I want to ask my doctor at my next appointment if I can continue using insulin injections and medication for longer, and if I can at least do it for a few years until I'm ready, because I want to enjoy my 20s a little more… I also want to ask him for a psychologist. Please don't judge me… I'm already too sad and guilty,I'm too… affected by that

Read this: [Type 2 Diabetes and the Shame Game](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2013/05/type-2-diabetes-and-shame-game.html) In all your long post you do not mention the actual diet your medical advisors prescribed, apart from noting excessive carb consumption, nor do you mention your meds and insulin regimen. It is difficult to comment further without that information. Please add that detail.

3. u/leeloodallas93 [score=2, created=2025-11-10T14:38:28]: Wow. Here I am angry that I take 2000 mg of metformin and insulin and my blood sugar is still high af. 170-270. I was diagnosed in August and haven’t had a cookie since. I’m sorry you feel bad. Just know it could be way worse.
