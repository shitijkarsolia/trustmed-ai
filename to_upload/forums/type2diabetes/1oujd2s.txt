===============================================================================

Hi all! Just another day of analyzing every decision I make 🙃 yeehaw. I am 23F, 5’8, and 106lbs. When I was diagnosed, I immediately became militant with exercise and cutting things out of my diet. As a result, I am now underweight and suffering the consequences. I’m weak, my menstrual cycles stopped, and it’s been especially counterproductive because I don’t even feel like I can lift weights anymore — lol! I’m upping my caloric intake now, but my body needs some serious healing time. My question is: My meals typically put me between 95-125 on my glucometer. Is it really necessary for me to be walking after every one? I would ideally like to make one gym trip a day (have to use the treadmill cuz I’m freezing my buns off). And I just feel like absolute dookie because of the workouts I tried before. Thank you!

Walking is not your problem; keep walking if you wish to, stop if you don't. More important is your excessive weight loss. A couple of questions to help with suggestions: * What dietary regimen are you following in terms of fats, protein and carbohydrates per meal or per day? * When do you test after meals?
