===============================================================================

I’ve had type 2 diabetes since I was 11 years old, and lately I’ve been seeing so many people with type 1 diabetes criticizing those of us with type 2. I notice it especially on social media, and what frustrates me the most is the hypocrisy these are often the same people who complain about others assuming their diabetes was caused by eating too much sugar or having an unhealthy diet, yet they turn around and use those same stereotypes against people with type 2. I’ve especially noticed this trend among people with type 1 diabetes on TikTok — they post their “unpopular opinions” about diabetes, and almost every time, one of them involves putting down people with type 2, acting like they’re somehow superior. I was diagnosed at 11, and I’ve always been healthy and active. My mom is a dietitian, so I grew up in a home where we ate balanced, nutritious meals every day. I’m honestly exhausted by the assumption especially from people with type 1 that those of us with type 2 diabetes are lazy or could just “fix” it by eating better and exercising more. It doesn’t work like that. Sometimes, it really just comes down to bad genetics.

Both of her brothers have it, their mother (my grandmother), all of my grandmother's siblings, and on and on. My only sibling, my brother, was just diagnosed about a year ago at age 60. I have also been overweight all of my life (my mother wasn't though) and ate lots of sugars and carbs, so it's likely I exacerbated it to come on sooner than it would have. But I doubt I would have escaped it altogether. Since being diagnosed and watching my carb intake, I have lost around 50 pounds and still have about 50 to go. I'm 65, so I'm not sure how much more will come off, but for sure some of it will. For me, it was more of a not "if" but "when" situation. Genetics are not on my side. A long story to say that I feel I couldn't have prevented it, just maybe staved it off a bit longer.
2. u/sempervirus [score=2, created=2025-11-14T12:20:34]: I've been T2 for five years, and nobody has ever criticized me for bringing it on myself, and if they didI would just tell them to f off. That being said, I find it entirely plausible that my diet contributed to the onset of diabetes. I ate large amounts of carbs and sweets for 60 years, and my body had had enough. But to let someone shame me, or to feel guilt, is just BS. If you want to assign blame, look to the modern diet and food industry.
3. u/Alarming_Risk_3520 [score=1, created=2025-11-14T02:39:58]: That’s the problem with type 1s. They think “woe is me” and then complain about the diabetes name and that’s why nondiabetics think the same as them. They think they have some sort of superiority complex all because they had it young and all this other stuff. I’ve talked to a type 1 about this stuff, I told her it’d be like if two cancer patients. One a throat cancer and the other a prostrate cancer, and one of them saying the other did it to themselves. Which according to the news nonsmokers are even getting throat cancer so. I’m getting off topic, the problem with this community, and the diabetes one as a whole? Is that they will hear something, parrot it to the other diabetic people. Instead of standing up against the people who aren’t educated. There’s fat people who have type 1 and there’s skinny people who have type 2. It doesn’t help when the stigma is what doctors carry as well. “Oh you’re over the age, and fat, type 2!” Then they’ll keep parroting to lose weight even when you’re trying to do what you can.
4. u/metabolicgeek [score=-2, created=2025-11-13T19:24:37]: Type 2 is most definitely caused by lifestyle. I’ve been able to “fix” type 2 by implementing a natural protocol called the feel great system. I can share a discount to it so you can begin your journey and not be frustrated anymore.
5. u/gobbstopperz [score=3, created=2025-11-13T01:07:44]: I seriously blame the usa food pyramid guidelines and corporations for stripping our food of nutrients and getting us hooked on junk food. I am still pre-diabetic , but give me more than 1/4 cup of carbs and my blood sugar soars. Thought I was eating pretty well. 😕
6. u/NFiligree [score=3, created=2025-11-12T22:56:02]: Only history, including family history, I have is very mild gestational diabetes 27 years ago, and covid. I've been moderately overweight for years, but have generally eaten healthy, and my numbers as far as A1C, cholesterol, BP, basically anything that could indicate anything, were perfect. Until about a year after I had covid, then BOOM, T2D and cholesterol became issues. Only thing my docs and I can come up with that's remotely plausible. So, nah, I didn't do this to myself. There's no reason under the sun why I should have diabetes. Only thing I can do from here on out is manage it.
7. u/IamJoyMarie [score=8, created=2025-11-12T15:53:27]: No diabetic did this to themselves; it is a function of the pancreas failing. I work with people who weigh 300+ pounds and eat horribly, no diabetes, I have another female coworker who is 5ft. 8 in, thin, and just got diagnosed with T2d. Her doctor prescribed metformin. He can't advise her to lose weight b/c she is under normal weight. My spouse is 5ft 10in, and weighs 167. He is T2d and takes metformin - he will never not be T2d. My friend's husband started with t2d and wound up on insulin. When he died he weighed 105 pounds at 5ft 5 in. He was always thing also. People need to be informed and educated.
8. u/HighFlowDiesel [score=4, created=2025-11-12T10:08:55]: Same, down to being the same age when we were diagnosed. Even if it was poor dietary habits that lead us here, if anyone it should be our parents getting the heat for this seeing as children don’t (or at least shouldn’t) have that much control over their diet.
9. u/Jerry11267 [score=4, created=2025-11-12T10:05:42]: I agree, doc told me many years ago that my type 2 was hereditary. Many type 2s dont have it by eating too much sugar they're are many factors involved in why we get it.
10. u/DragoPunk [score=13, created=2025-11-12T09:00:38]: Regardless of the cause, no one asked for it.
11. u/happy_little_indian [score=2, created=2025-11-12T07:24:57]: I try not to judge others when it comes to the culminating causes that could have lead to said diagnosis, but In my particular case I definitely expedited my diagnoses with a bad diet. It’s funny because I’ve always worked physically laborious jobs and I would spend some of my free time walking in parks or at the gym believing I was healthy and doing right by my body…..But the old adage “you can’t outrun a bad diet” is the truest form of irony for me. That being said. Nobody is perfect. Sometimes genetics kicks you in the face, sometimes you don’t realize until it’s too late, maybe you’re born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline. 🤷‍♀️
12. u/Zeus783 [score=13, created=2025-11-12T03:29:58]: The title implies that some *DO* cause it to themselves? 🤔 Has any new discovery on genetics been released that I'm not aware of? 😳 I don't think anybody sit around the table and plan to get a chronic disease... And if you're referring to those people who can't put the fork down I'm sure they'd love for someone to show them a way to tell their brain to just eat like a bird and be as fit as an athlete. 😤
13. u/SunLillyFairy [score=10, created=2025-11-12T01:13:14]: It's definitely the wide held belief, and it's pushed by doctors too... maybe not intentionally, but it is. I'm in my 50's and I've managed this disease since I was in my 20's. I was thin and healthy when I got pregnant, and I still got gestational. My doctor told me "this should go away after you give birth, but this your body telling you it has a weakness and if you eat bad and don't exercise you'll get regular diabetes." It did go away, and then I ate healthier than most of my peers and stayed active, but still got it. Diet and exercise helped me stay off meds from 30-40, but soon after they were needed despite them. I felt like my doctor didn't believe me when I told him I ate low carb, he sent me to a nutrition counselor so I "could learn how I was really eating" because "sugars are sneaky and you probably just don't realize what you're taking in." Asshole! It's my genetics, but even that doctor assumed I was eating crap. My grandson, who is 9, had some basic labs done a couple of months ago, they showed he was pre-diabetic. I'm still crying over it. I am raising him he eats very healthy foods, but he's still pre-diabetic. His doctor referred me to a dietician. Being older and less tolerant I expressed my frustration - over 30 years I've managed my condition and I know how to eat healthy and how to feed a kid well. She apologized and said she just sends all her patients there "because it's usually caused by poor diet and weight." I call BS. My friend weighs 300 pounds and doesn't have it - I do at half her size. Does eating well and exercise help manage the condition? Yes. Is it the cause? No. And I won't even get started about how our body chemistry sets us up to gain weight even when we eat the same calories...
14. u/arguix [score=4, created=2025-11-12T00:51:16]: is diabetes, type 1 or 2 ever caused by anyone? I didn’t know that was possible.
15. u/Snoozinsioux [score=3, created=2025-11-11T23:47:24]: Because it didn’t used to be well studied since it effected populations that most people don’t really care about. I was diagnosed at 19. My dad has had it at least since his 40s (he was born in 1935). His mom had complications from it by the time she was in her late teens…she was born at the turn of the 20th century and worked the fields as a child in a very poor family; I’m quite sure she wasn’t sitting around or eating junk food.
16. u/Greedy-Fortune-3276 [score=2, created=2025-11-11T23:08:54]: I had a manner of autoimmune and hormone related conditions. The major cause was primary hyperparathyroidism. This triggered alot of my health issues, including diabetes:(
17. u/ATLDeepCreeker [score=-13, created=2025-11-11T21:59:18]: Exhausted by it? Get off the internet. You dont HAVE to read comments.
18. u/Tzepish [score=28, created=2025-11-11T21:19:57]: Not a single person gave themselves type 2 Diabetes. Even the most overweight, gluttonous, sugar fiend in history did not give it to themselves - most people like that don't have it! The disease is genetic and causes insulin resistance. Being overweight makes insulin resistance worse, but you have to have already had it. Some people just don't understand correlation and causation.
19. u/alan_s [score=7, created=2025-11-11T20:53:37]: Unfortunately ignorance and stereotypes are always with us. I've learned to just ignore the idiots whenever possible. My longer opinion, written many years ago, is here: [Type 2 Diabetes and the Shame Game](http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2013/05/type-2-diabetes-and-shame-game.html)
20. u/Sassy-Me86 [score=4, created=2025-11-11T20:02:02]: I had gestational diabetes, and it, along having my dad develop it in his 40s, previous high blood pressure issues, and yes, being overweight, meant I had a much higher chance of developing it. Well, the first few months PP I was fine. But then I started feeling not that great. Did routine blodsowrk to find out i was now type 2. So yay.
21. u/Ischarde [score=4, created=2025-11-11T19:22:45]: My maternal great grandmother lived to be in her 90s, with type 2, on insulin. She was born in the 1890s iirc. I don't know when she was diagnosed, diabetes wasn't on my event horizon when I was a child. My mother was diagnosed in her 60s and was always a fairly active person. My father was diagnosed in his late 50s. I've been a type 2 for 25 yrs. So it was genetic. My son was diagnosed as type 2 last yr. But what hurt me the most was a friend telling me of her diagnosis and her saying she guessed she ate too many cookies and sweets as a child. I told her no. It's just a failure of our bodies to process sweets. We did nothing to cause this. And you know, I feel sorry for Type 1s, most of type 2s know what ice cream and birthday cake tastes like!
22. u/saltylilfry [score=6, created=2025-11-11T19:02:01]: Thank you! - Sincerely a type 2 diabetic with shitty genes and endometriosis
23. u/karmacatsmeow- [score=5, created=2025-11-11T19:00:42]: And honestly, who the fuck are they to judge. Have you never done anything in poor judgement? Had a bad habit loop? Struggled with a behavior? I don’t think very many humans can say that.
24. u/ohsothisnowgreat [score=0, created=2025-11-11T18:27:55]: Diagnosed type 2 in Jan 2024 after going into DKA. Did I do this to myself? Probably because I was fat. But no one in my family or extended family had diabetes.
