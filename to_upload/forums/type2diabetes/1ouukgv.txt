===============================================================================

In June, a severe foot infection landed me in the hospital for four days. I (40/f) hadn’t been to a doctor in a long time, and when they tested me, my A1C came back at 10.2. Hearing that number hit hard and I felt like I’d really let my health spiral out of control. Soda had always been my biggest vice, and that was the first thing to go. As of today, I’ve gone 166 days without a single soda! I started metformin in June and added Mounjaro in August. Since my diagnosis, I’ve lost 30 pounds, and my A1C is now 5.6! I can’t even describe how proud and grateful I feel. It’s not just about the numbers, it’s about feeling in control again, making choices that support my health, and proving to myself that change is possible. This community has been such a huge source of strength and motivation for me. Reading everyone’s stories, the challenges, the victories, the ups and downs, has made me feel less alone and more inspired every day. Thank you all for sharing your journeys and helping others believe they can turn things around too.

Is it because it is sending messages for sweets to my brain? Chemicals « aspartame » or another reason. Any other reasons, I am open to understanding. I don’t see myself dropping it. TYIA.

My body demanded that I give in and and consume a Dew. It took me awhile but I am off that stuff. Congratulations and keep up the GREAT work! P.S. my triglycerides dropped big time when I quit drinking that stuff. 🥹
