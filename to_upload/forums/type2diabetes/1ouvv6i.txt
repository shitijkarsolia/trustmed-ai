===============================================================================

Hey guys, I just need to feel not alone. I’m 27M who at the begging of September was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I had neglected my health pretty much my entire adult life and am morbidly obese. At my first doctors appointment, my A1C 9.2 and I had elevated iron levels. I was sent to. A hematologist and now have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease. I’m really struggling with feeling like my youth is gone. A big part of my social life was going out to bars, sporting events, ect with my friends and drinking. My doctor asked me to not drink for a month and I complied. They now have asked me to not drink for an additional two months. Since my diagnosed I have lost 20 pounds, quit smoking, and my labs and blood sugar have been looking better. I’m just really struggling to be happy living this way. It feels like every time I leave the house, I have to plan my life around my diagnosis. Anyone else deal with this? Am I going crazy or being overly dramatic?

It is tiring, stressful and yes, your life does revolve around it. It is a shock..everything changes. There is a need to grieve the loss of your old life and mourn what you lost, so you can accept the new reality and make peace with it.

Your inner dialog notwithstanding, you’re marching toward remission. And that’s you flipping off the arch villains of habit that thwart us all.

I have health issues as a consequence. I know it is no fun, but it sounds like you are making good healthful choices for your body. Try to make friends with ppl who put their health first ( like a walking grp) so you are not alone in your journey.

The good news is- abstaining from alcohol is huge in your livers regeneration. Or so I am told. Excess sugars- soda, Gatorade and orange juice to name three culprits - also are contributing factors. It’s all connected. Here is some advice my NPR gave me. Just keep chipping away at the lifestyle changes. Every single change helps and if you keep chipping at it, you will get it to be managed. Start taking walks. Everyone of us has moments of feeling defeated!

It is a massive shift in your lifestyle and identity. Well done on making significant changes in your health, that is a huge achievement. I hope for you (like it has for me) that it just becomes less of a big deal each day. I hope it settles and you don't feel you have to put so much thought into everything. You have a whole life ahead of you and by putting in the work in now, it will become more normalized for you in future. Wishing you all the best!

10. u/matesailor [score=1, created=2025-11-11T21:52:03]: No. It’s the feeling shame about not taking care of myself, the constant anxiety whenever I eat something I shouldn’t, fearing complications, and not being able to drink. It does make me feel sad that I feel like I can’t ever have one of those nights out anymore where I wasn’t worried about anything. I feel like I’m 27 and I’m going to be sick everyday and then die.
