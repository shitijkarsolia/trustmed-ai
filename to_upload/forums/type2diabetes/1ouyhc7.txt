Cross posting. Hi, My 68 yrs old mum is new newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for about a month now and she hasn't been feeling well ever since she's started taking meds. She was still up and about cooking and cleaning pre-diagnosis, but since on meds, she's been uncomfortable and just stays in bed all day and stares into space or sleeps. Average Blood Pressure: 130-148 mmHg Average Blood sugar: 6.6-7.5 mmol/L She's lost about 4kg since then. Meds she's taking: - Metformin 500mg once daily - Amlodipine 5mg once daily - Bisoprolol 2.5mg once daily - 14 Amlodipine 10mg once daily (Not sure why twice) - 14 Aspirin 75mg once daily - 14 Simvastatin 20mg Her issues below: - Super Fatigued - Feels weak, even walking around is a challenge - Overall feeling exhausted all the time - Out of breath generally and when talking - Chest discomfort - Under arm pain in left side intermittently - Upper body feeling hot all the time, but also cold? - Lower legs from mid-shin down is cold - Always thirsty - Dizzy/ headaches - Fewer bowel movements 2-3 times a week only Her diet since diagnosed: Breakfast: - Small bowl of oats with egg mixed in Lunch &amp; Dinner - Brown basmati rice 50-100g dry weight - Streamed Fish, chicken or minced pork/ Egg - Blanche Lettuce or broccoli A slice of whole-wheat bread or cracker before meds in late afternoon Lots of water, and only water. She's very stubborn and picky with food only eats food that she's used to. Being based in the UK, seeing a doctor is near impossible, instead we see nurses unless it's life threatening. Waiting lists are up to 3 weeks to see a doctor. My question is, what is making her feel like this? Is it the meds, diet or something else, like menopause or a mental factor - depression? I'm so worried about her and hate seeing her waste away like this. She's a very strong person before and now can hardly move. I don't know what else to do. Thanks in advance!

A dietitian can tailor a plan that fits her goals and medications. Foods like oats, rice, and bread are higher in carbohydrates, so they can raise blood sugar. Even if the new medicine is helping overall, some meals can still cause bigger after meal rises, and can cause insulin to spike, which can often be a cause for many symptoms associated with diabetes. While she cannot check her insulin levels at home, she can check blood glucose before and about two hours after meals to spot patterns. That simple check can be very helpful. Trying a lower carbohydrate approach for a few weeks could be a gentle experiment. Build meals around nonstarchy vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Keep portions of grains and starchy foods smaller, if any. Stomach upset is common when starting metformin. Taking it with food, increasing the dose gradually, or asking about the extended release version often helps. If symptoms are strong or do not improve, she should reach out to her prescriber. She should certainly not stop the medicine without guidance though. For cold hands and feet, improving circulation can help. Short walks, light stretching, massage, warm baths, staying hydrated, and warm socks or gloves are all good options. If the medication is helpful, you’ll start seeing improvement, but it takes the body a while to heal. For many, how they feel around the time of their diagnosis may linger for a long time, but if she is making improvements to her health, eventually will start to feel the effects of those improvements. And any movement in the right direction is a victory.
