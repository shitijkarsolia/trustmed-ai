===============================================================================

ETA: I have a dexcom g7, and I have over patches from Amazon Has anyone tried an alternative placement of their cgm other than the back of their arms? And are the readings still as accurate? My skin is really sensitive to the adhesive apparently, and I’ve already knocked off a sensor by accident at work. I googled it and watched videos on other placements. I guess I just wanted to get other peoples opinions :)

I started using adhesive patches that go over the sensors along with something called a "skin tac wipe" to make it stick better. Works pretty good for me. I normally go through two patches per sensor (they last ~1 week) and use the wipe before placing the sensor as well. The wipe is sticky as all get out. Be careful not to get it all over you if you go this route. Both are available on Amazon.
