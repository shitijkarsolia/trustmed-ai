===============================================================================

I don't have diabetes officially yet, but I have all the symptoms, including insulin resistance. My necks been dark since I was a small child. (like 5-7), and no matter how much I scrub it won't go away. If I cut out sugar, how long would it need to be for my neck to go to a normal color?

The key is to take your medications, work on your diet, and get exercise. No bullshit, no crap, no cutting corners, and take it seriously, like your life depends upon it. It does. Sorry for the language, but this is advice from the heart that you need to take seriously.

So, even if your blood sugar is coming down, your insulin may still be a bit high as it adjusts. I know I had this pretty badly, on my neck, arms, and thighs, and as I got things in check, it did clear up entirely. If I remember correctly, it cleared up relatively quickly, maybe after six months of losing weight and maintaining a low-carb diet.

In my experience, once I started eating properly and exercising, my dark neck and other areas lightened up after 2 weeks! Mind you, not completely; you just have to keep going through with a good regimen and it’ll get lighter as you go.

It's more noticeable and prevalent among people with darker tones of skin. It's called acanthosis nigricans if anyone would like to know more. I did experience this darkened skin on my neck years before my T2D diagnosis. It clear up fairly quickly after I stopped all sugar intake. It took maybe a year to fully recover I'd say.
