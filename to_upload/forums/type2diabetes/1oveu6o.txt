===============================================================================

Hello all, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago based on my A1C. My doctor at the time, prescribed me Metformin to help get my numbers down. Fast forward to today, I have a different doctor and my A1C is now 5.8, early prediabetes range. He said that I can get off Metformin now which worried me since I'm still not in the ideal range. Is the reasoning that I just do lifestyle changes now? I've been eating a lot better either way but I'm nervous to stop Metformin completely since it has been helping me so much. Has anyone else experienced something similar, if so how did you end up? I'd love to hear anyone's experience, thank you!

2. u/CollectiveGood222 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T23:47:46]: I agree with others that this sounds like great news but to definitely takes your valid concerns up with your doc. Would also agree that the lifestyle changes you’ve made around nutrition and exercise are significant and definitely have helped the metformin do its job. If you keep them up long term you could certainly get out of pre diabetic range without meds. Big kudos to you!!
3. u/FustianRiddle [score=3, created=2025-11-12T18:07:18]: I mean that sounds like good news honestly! But also you should take those concerns up with your doctor as they are entirely valid - "I'm doing well on this medication, these are my habits, and I'm worried that without metformin my numbers will worsen again"
4. u/solodav [score=2, created=2025-11-12T17:59:25]: Honestly, that’s so close to normal that I can understand why he’d ask. I mean, my mom used to have pre-diabetes at like 6.1 A1c and it runs in our family. I’m full blown diabetic with 8.5 A1c (most recent) and her doctor hasn’t prescribed Metformin or any drugs at all. She’s asked to get tested every 3 months, but even at the pre-diabetes range, she was told to just use “natural” preventative methods. She finally got down to 5.2 A1c and I think the doctor is testing her less. If I had to guess, I think maybe doctors worry about side-effects of drugs when they’re not always needed and try to balance the risk/reward. I don’t think what your doctor is asking is particularly unusual/concerning. If your blood sugar levels do go back up, you can always go back on the Metformin. If you wear a CGM (continuous glucose monitor), you can basically know in real-time and make a quick adjustment if needed. Biggest negative of Metformin for me is the bloatedness, gas, and diarrhea.

Maybe you need to look into some more natural ways of keeping your blood sugar in check. Just try it and keep an eye on your sugars if you feel like you're uncomfortable with it. Talk to your doctor about it some more
6. u/IamJoyMarie [score=2, created=2025-11-12T15:58:10]: My original doctor, upon stating I was diabetic, said...take long baths and long walks and gave me a coupon booklet for Glucerna; when I left her and went to a different doctor, he said he could not believe that I was no on at the very least metformin. If you are under the doctor's decision to prescribe or not prescribe, you're in a situation. Someone below wrote to test your numbers; do that. Keep track.
7. u/yamahamama61 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T15:44:04]: Well, test your Dr.s wisdom for a month. Keep track of your BS. Without the metformin. 1st thing in the morning and 2 hours after every meal. If bs stays low you know your good. If it raises to a level you not comfortable with. Take a metformin.
8. u/Sir_Toccoa [score=4, created=2025-11-12T14:39:50]: Just my humble, non-medical opinion: if the metformin is working, why discontinue it? As long as you aren’t having any adverse side effects, it seems like it’s been helpful to you. Also, there was a study recently that showed a certain combination of medication/supplements actually worked to extend life at a cellular level, even for non-diabetics. I remember Metformin being a part of routine. https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-metformin-a-wonder-drug-202109222605 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779524/
9. u/Tony-31375 [score=4, created=2025-11-12T14:23:04]: Get another doctors opinion not Reddit But if you ask me, your A1C is at 5.8 while using metformin, if you’re off the medication something tells me that you will go up again.
10. u/PacRimRod [score=1, created=2025-11-12T13:24:34]: Definitely, definitely trust Reddit over your doctors advice. SMH.. get a real second opinion from another doctor airing your situation and concerns.
11. u/hu_gnew [score=7, created=2025-11-12T12:55:53]: According to my PCP, anything under a 7.0 is "OK" for a diabetic. I was consistently at about 5.8 for over a year, then had a test of 5.4. He took me off Metformin at that time. A1c went up to 6.0 at the next check up but I managed to bring it back to 5.8 and keep it there for about a year and a half through further restrictions on my carb intake. This became burdensome, couldn't even have a slice of whole wheat toast with an omelet without my fasting/morning finger stick approaching 150 mg/dl the next day. Told him I was concerned about the health of my eyes and wanted to return to a low dose of Metformin. He agreed and I'm down to 5.5 while having about 130 to 150 grams of carbs per day. To be clear, I'm not "aiming" for in-range A1c tests, I just want to have appropriate amounts of complex carbs with my meals. His main argument against medication was a worry about hypoglycemia. I was able to show him my prior year's worth of finger sticks on my monitor's phone app to show I had never dipped below the mid 90's. Also gave him a run down of my diet to allay concerns about nutrition.
12. u/zoebud2011 [score=3, created=2025-11-12T12:51:58]: My doctor told me I could stop taking it if I wanted to. I said no, don't fix it if it ain't broke. My A1c is 5.4.
13. u/Ethan-Wakefield [score=4, created=2025-11-12T12:49:18]: Is your doctor saying this more like "You can stop if you don't want to take it anymore" or is it more like "I want you to stop taking it"? The nuance here matters.
14. u/EggieRowe [score=2, created=2025-11-12T12:49:15]: I was taking Metformin for pre-diabetes, borderline T2 (6.2), until my A1c was comfortably out of the pre-diabetes range (5.2). The only reason why I quit was because I strength train regularly now and some studies show that Metformin can blunt muscle hypertrophy. Otherwise I'd still be on it because there's a host of positive benefits associated with it. I was on the lowest regular release dose.
15. u/BackItUpWithLinks [score=4, created=2025-11-12T12:39:35]: There are reasons for taking metformin other than for diabetes It helps prevent some cancers, helps ward off dementia, helps with weight loss, helps prevent cardiovascular issues There’s more reason for people to be on metformin than there are for you to stop taking it
16. u/No_Sundae_1068 [score=1, created=2025-11-12T12:35:45]: I was in the pre diabetic stage and my doctor kept me on it. But how long have you been in the pre diabetic stage?
