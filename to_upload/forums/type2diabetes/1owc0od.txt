===============================================================================

Hello everyone! I (F 28) have been dealing with a problem and would appreciate any kind of advice. Last year my a1c was 5.1 and fasting blood sugar 78. Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed agoraphobia. In October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 mg/dl then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor said it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling.

It definitely helps to build a new food routine that does not involve wild swings of too much sugar to no sugar a balance somewhere in between is more healthy. It is good to cut most carbs and sugars out, but you can cheat a little now and then it be OK. It can be hard to totally deprive yourself of eating things you enjoy. Finding the balance can be a challenge But your head needs to be in a good space to accomplish that.
