hate to be that person but im so proud of my daily graph today. first time off all insulin and back ar work full time! was very scared because i now no longer have time to workout in the morning (which i find regulates me the rest of the day) but i got to workout in the evening and everything looks pretty good. i eat low to moderate carbs so im not afraid of spiking here and there but to not go past 100 was very rewarding!
